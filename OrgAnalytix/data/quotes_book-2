0,Cressen,Pylos,"Maester Cressen, we have visitors."
1,Cressen,Pylos,The princess would see  the white raven.
2,Cressen,Pylos,Her fool is with her.
3,Cressen,Pylos,Help me to  my chair and show them in.
4,Cressen,Pylos,Go bring her.It is ill to keep a lady  waiting.
5,Cressen,Pylos,"Who comes to see us so early, Pylos?"
6,Cressen,Pylos,"Its me and Patches, Maester."
7,Cressen,Shireen,"Pylos said  we might see the white raven.Indeed you may,"
8,Cressen,Pylos,"Maester Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery for the Lady  Shireen.It would be my pleasure."
9,Patchface,Pylos,"Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers,I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."
10,Cressen,Shireen,"Sit with me, child."
11,Cressen,Shireen,"This is early to come calling, scarce past dawn.You  should be snug in your bed.I had bad dreams,About the dragons.They were coming to eat me."
12,Cressen,Shireen,"We have  talked of this before,The dragons cannot come to life."
13,Dalla,Shireen,"The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the  shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome,  just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations."
14,Dalla,Shireen,"So you see, there is  nothing to fear. "
15,Dalla,Shireen,What about the thing in the sky?
16,Cressen,Dalla,"If the dragons are  breathing, doesnt that mean they are coming to life?"
17,Dalla,Shireen,"The thing in the sky is a comet, sweet child."
18,Cressen,Shireen,Watch and see.
19,Cressen,Shireen,"Mother said the white raven means its not summer anymore.That is so, my lady.The white ravens fly only from the Citadel."
20,Cressen,Shireen,"They are larger than other ravens, and more clever,  bred to carry only the most important messages."
21,Cressen,Shireen,"Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living  memory.Will it get cold now?"
22,Cressen,Shireen,"In time,If the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful  harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come."
23,Patchface,Shireen,"It is always summer under the sea,The merwives wear  nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed.I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."
24,Patchface,Shireen,"I should like a gown of silver seaweed.Under the sea, it snows up,and the rain is dry as bone."
25,Cressen,Shireen,"It will,"
26,Cressen,Shireen,"Ah, here is Pylos with the  bird."
27,Cressen,Pylos,"Here,"
28,Cressen,Pylos,"Ill see to your breakfast now,"
29,Cressen,Pylos,"This is the Lady Shireen,"
30,Cressen,Patchface,"Lady,Lady."
31,Cressen,Patchface,"It talks!A few words.As I said, they are clever, these birds.Clever bird, clever man, clever clever fool,Oh, clever clever clever fool."
32,Cressen,Patchface,"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord,The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my  lord. "
33,Patchface,Shireen,He sings that all the time.
34,Patchface,Shireen,Make him stop.
35,Aerys,Cressen,"We have  found the most splendid fool,Only a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers."
36,Cressen,Stannis,"Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach  Stannis how to laugh."
37,Cressen,Patchface,"The wretch is mad, and in pain, and no use to anyone, least of all himself,The kindest thing you could do for that one is fill his cup with  the milk of the poppy."
38,Cressen,Patchface,Hed bless you if he had the wit for it.
39,Cressen,Patchface,"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord "
40,Pylos,Steffon,"Lord,Lord, lord, lord.A fool sings what he will,You must not take his words to heart.On the morrow he may remember another song, and this one will never be heard again."
41,Cressen,Pylos,"Maester, pardons.You have forgotten the porridge,"
42,Cressen,Pylos,"Maester, Ser Davos returned last night."
43,Pylos,Stannis,I thought you would want  to know at once.Davos .
44,Pylos,Stannis,Where is he?With the king.They have been together most of the night.
45,Cressen,Shireen,"I should have been told,I should have been woken."
46,Pylos,Shireen,"Pardons, my lady, but I must speak with your lord father."
47,Pylos,Stannis,"Notch, draw, loose."
48,Cressen,Pylos,"Wait  here,Its best I see him alone.It is a long climb, Maester."
49,Cressen,Pylos,You think I have forgotten?I have climbed these steps so often I know each one by  name.
50,Cressen,Davos,"Ser Davos,When did you return?In the black of morning.My favorite time."
51,Cressen,Stannis,And?
52,Cressen,Stannis,It is as you warned him.
53,Cressen,Stannis,They do not  love him.
54,Cressen,Stannis,You spoke to them all?All?
55,Beric,Stannis,To them Ill  always be the Onion Knight.
56,Beric,Stannis,"I broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose, and  the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove."
57,Beric,Renly,"Bryce the Orange, of the Rainbow Guard.The Rainbow Guard?Renlys made his own Kingsguard,"
58,Beric,Renly,Loras Tyrells their Lord Commander.
59,Cressen,Renly,Look at me!
60,Cressen,Renly,"Look at me, Im a dragon,Look at me, Im a wizard,Look at me, look at me,  Im the rain god."
61,Cressen,Davos,What reasons did the lords give for their refusals?
62,Cressen,Davos,"Well, as to that, some gave me soft words and some blunt, some made excuses, some promises, some  only lied."
63,Cressen,Davos,"In the end words are just wind.You could bring him no hope?Only the false sort, and Id not do that,He had the truth from me."
64,Cressen,Stannis,"Ser Davos, truth  can be a bitter draught, even for a man like Lord Stannis."
65,Davos,Stannis,".if he takes this meager host to Kings Landing, it will be only to die."
66,Davos,Stannis,"I  told him as much, but you know his pride."
67,Davos,Stannis,My fingers will grow back  before that man bends to sense.
68,Davos,Stannis,You have done all you could.Now I must add my voice to yours.
69,Cressen,Stannis,"I knew you would come, old man, whether I summoned you or no."
70,Cressen,Stannis,"Once you would have woken me,Once you were young.Now you are old and sick, and need your sleep."
71,Cressen,Stannis,"I knew youd learn what Davos had to say soon enough.You always do, dont you?I would be of no help to you if I did not,I met Davos on the stair.And he told all, I suppose?I should have had the mans tongue shortened along with his fingers.He would have made you a poor envoy then.He made me a poor envoy in any case."
72,Renly,Robert,For R enly! 
73,Renly,Robert,"Your brother has been the Lord of Storms End these past thirteen years.   Stannis broke in, "
74,Renly,Robert,Storms End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should  have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne.
75,Renly,Stannis,"Robert did you an injustice,"
76,Petyr,Renly,"He needed a mans strength to rule here, and  Renly was but a child.He is a child still,"
77,Petyr,Renly,"I ask  you, why did the gods inflict me with brothers?I cannot answer for the gods.You seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me."
78,Renly,Steffon,"What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine?It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace."
79,Robert,Stannis,"Your Grace,You mock me with a kings style, yet what am I king of?Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom."
80,Emmon,Salladhor,"Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they  are."
81,Cressen,Stannis,"What  must I do now?Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord,If you and your brother  were to make common cause against them-I will not treat with Renly,Not while he calls  himself a king.Not Renly, then,"
82,Eddard,Robert,"Others might serve your needs as well.Eddard Starks son has been  proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him.A green boy,and another false king. Cressen said,   "
83,Cressen,Eddard,"And small good it did either of them. Be that as it may, my lord,Great wrongs have been done you, but the  past is dust."
84,Shireen,Stannis,   Lord Stannis objected.
85,Lysa,Stannis,"Shell never part with the boy, I promise you that. Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie,Dragonstone is a grim home for a child.Let her fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her.Familiar and hideous."
86,Cressen,Stannis,Still .
87,Cressen,Stannis,Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers?
88,Cressen,Stannis,"My lady,"
89,Selyse,Stannis,I do not beg.
90,Selyse,Stannis,"Mind you remember that, woman.I am pleased to hear it, my lord."
91,Selyse,Stannis,"Lady Arryn owes you her allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly,  and all the rest."
92,Selyse,Stannis,It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for  what is rightfully yours by the grace of god.
93,Robert,Stannis,"Your god can keep his grace,Its  swords I need, not blessings.Do you have an army hidden somewhere that youve not told me of?"
94,Selyse,Stannis,"My brothers and uncles and cousins have armies,House Florent will rally to your  banner.House Florent can field two thousand swords at best."
95,Selyse,Stannis,"And you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I  do, my lady.The Florent lands lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrells  wrath.There is another way."
96,Selyse,Stannis,"Look out your windows, my lord."
97,Aegon,Stannis,"only say the word, and embrace the power of the Lord of Light.How many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand?"
98,Robert,Stannis,"All you need,The swords of Storms End and Highgarden for a start, and all their  lords bannermen.Davos would tell you different,Those swords are sworn to Renly."
99,Renly,Robert,"and as they have never loved me.Yes,"
100,Renly,Stannis,.
101,Cressen,Renly,it is not to be  thought.  I call them treasons.
102,Cressen,Stannis,"My brother is young and strong, and he  has a vast host around him, and these rainbow knights of his.Melisandre has gazed into the flames, and seen him dead."
103,Cressen,Selyse,Fratricide .
104,Selyse,Stannis,"please, listen to me."
105,Selyse,Stannis,"And what will you tell him, Maester?How he might win half a  kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn?I have heard your counsel, Cressen,Now I will hear hers.You are dismissed."
106,Cressen,Pylos,"Help me,"
107,Cressen,Melisandre,"I will speak her name,Melisandre.Her."
108,Harren,Nan,Pylos?
109,Cressen,Pylos,"Pylos, I need help."
110,Cressen,Pylos,"Make haste,I have slept too long."
111,Cressen,Pylos,I should have been woken.
112,Alla,Allar,
113,Cersei,Tyrion,
114,Patchface,Stannis,"The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord. "
115,Cressen,Patchface,"Under the sea, you fall up,I know, I know, oh, oh, oh. "
116,Melisandre,Patchface,"Thank you, ser,"
117,Chett,Melisandre,"Maester,You ought  take more care."
118,Melisandre,Patchface,I .
119,Melisandre,Patchface,"thank you, my lady.A man your age must look to where he steps,The night is dark and full  of terrors."
120,Melisandre,Patchface,"Only  children fear the dark,"
121,Melisandre,Patchface,"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord. Now here is a riddle,A clever fool and a foolish wise man."
122,Cressen,Patchface,"A crown to match your chain, Lord Maester,"
123,Melisandre,Stannis,"I need no crown but truth,There are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown."
124,Cressen,Pylos,"Maester Pylos,You ."
125,Cressen,Pylos,you did not wake me.His Grace commanded me to let you rest.
126,Cressen,Pylos,He told me you were  not needed here.
127,Davos,Stannis,"You are too ill and too confused to be of use to me, old man."
128,Cressen,Stannis,Pylos will counsel me henceforth.
129,Cressen,Stannis,I will not have you kill yourself in my service.
130,Sandor,Tyrion,
131,Davos,Stannis,Might not I have a place at your table?
132,Davos,Stannis,"I should be honored if the maester would sit here beside me, Your  Grace.As you will."
133,Davos,Patchface,"Here we eat fish,Under the sea, the fish  eat us.I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."
134,Davos,Stannis,"We all should be in motley tonight,"
135,Cressen,Stannis,"Before shes done  were all like to see what Patchface saw, I fearthe bottom of the sea."
136,Selyse,Stannis,Lord Stannis.
137,Selyse,Stannis,"King Stannis.You forget  yourself, Maester.He is old, his mind wanders,What is it, Cressen?Speak your mind.As you intend to sail, it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady Arryn ."
138,Selyse,Stannis,"I make common cause with no one,No more than light makes common cause with darkness."
139,Cressen,Stannis,"The Starks seek to steal half my kingdom, even as the Lannisters have stolen my  throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights.They  are all usurpers, and they are all my enemies."
140,Melisandre,Selyse,"You are the rightful heir to your brother Robert, the true  Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men,but even so, you cannot hope to triumph without allies.He has an ally,WhIlor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and  Shadow.Gods make uncertain allies at best,and that one has no power here.You think not?"
141,Patchface,Selyse,"If you will speak such folly, Maester, you ought to wear  your crown again.Yes,Patchess helm."
142,Patchface,Stannis,"Put it on again, I command you.Under the sea, no one wears hats,I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."
143,Patchface,Stannis,"Fool,my lady wife commands."
144,Selyse,Stannis,"Perhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth,You go too far, woman,He is an old man, and hes served me well."
145,Davos,Melisandre,Mayhaps I have been a fool.
146,Davos,Melisandre,A cup to toast his power? 
147,Davos,Melisandre,If you wish.
148,Davos,Stannis,What are you doing?
149,Davos,Stannis,"A thing that must be done,for the sake of the realm, and the soul of my  lord."
150,Cressen,Melisandre,"It is not too late to spill the wine, Maester.No,No.As you will."
151,Cressen,Melisandre,And now you.
152,Cressen,Melisandre,"He does  have power here, my lord,And fire cleanses."
153,Chett,Yoren,Arya HorsefaceLumpyhead.
154,Chett,Yoren,"Im taking men and boys from the city,Now you hold still, boy."
155,Arya,Yoren,"Gate shouldnt be  hard, but the roads another matter."
156,Arya,Yoren,"I got thirty this time, men  and boys all bound for the Wall, and dont be thinking theyre like that bastard brother o yours."
157,Arya,Yoren,"Lord Eddard gave me pick o the dungeons, and I didnt find no little lordlings down there."
158,Arya,Yoren,"Thatll be the hardest part, the pissing, so dont drink no moren you need."
159,Hot,Yoren,"The Watch needs good  men,but you lot will have to do."
160,Hot,Lommy,"Look at that sword Lumpyheads got there,"
161,Arya,Yoren,Wheres a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?
162,Hot,Yoren,"Maybe hes a little squire,Hot pies!"
163,Arya,Hot,I bet its just some play sword made  of tin.
164,Arya,Hot,"Its castle-forged steel, you stupid,and you better shut your mouth."
165,Hot,Lommy,"Whered you get a blade like that, Lumpyface?"
166,Hot,Lommy,"Lumpyhead,He probly stole it.I did not!"
167,Hot,Jon,"If he stole it, we could take it off him,Its not his anyhow.I could use me a sword like  that."
168,Hot,Lommy,"Go on, take it off him, I dare you."
169,Hot,Lommy,"Hey, Lumpyface, you gimme that sword."
170,Arya,Hot,You dont know how to use it.
171,Arya,Lommy,"Look at him,I bet hes going to cry now.You want to cry,  Lumpyhead?"
172,Hot,Lommy,"Hes going to wet his pants,Leave him be,"
173,Hot,Lommy,"You better give Hot Pie the sword, Arry,Hot Pie wants it bad."
174,Hot,Lommy,"Hell do the same to you, I bet.I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls, and I kept kicking him there until he was dead,I kicked him all to  pieces."
175,Arya,Hot,You better gimme the sword.
176,Arya,Hot,"You can have this one,Thats just some stick."
177,Arya,Lommy,You want  some sword too?
178,Arya,Hot,"Behind you,"
179,Arya,Lommy,"Enough,you want to kill the fool?"
180,Arya,Lommy,"Shut your mouths, or Ill be shutting them for you.Any more o this, Ill tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall."
181,Arya,Lommy,"And that goes  twice for you, Arry."
182,Davos,Stannis,
183,Arya,Yoren,"If I  had a thimble o sense, I wouldve left you in Kings Landing.You hear me, boy?"
184,Arya,Yoren,Unlace your breeches and pull em down.
185,Arya,Yoren,Do it.
186,Arya,Yoren,"Over there, against the oak.Yes, like that."
187,Arya,Yoren,You scream now.You scream loud.
188,Arya,Yoren,Think that hurt?
189,Arya,Yoren,Try this one.
190,Arya,Yoren,One more.
191,Arya,Yoren,"Might be I got  your attention now,Next time you take that stick to one of your brothers, youll get twice  what you give, you hear me?Now cover yourself."
192,Syrio,Yoren,You hurt?
193,Lommy,Syrio,Some.
194,Lommy,Syrio,That pie boys hurting worse.
195,Arya,Lommy,"Hitting them wont bring him back.I know,Heres something you dont know."
196,Arya,Yoren,"Only something went queer.Joffrey,Someone should kill him!Someone will, but it wont be me, nor you neither."
197,Arya,Yoren,"Got sourleaf  back at the wagons,Youll chew some, itll help with  the sting."
198,Arya,Lommy,"Every time you look at him, he  twitches,"
199,Arya,Eddard,"The Red Sword,"
200,Jon,Rickon,"little sister.I missed you,"
201,Joffrey,Sansa,What do you think it means?
202,Joffrey,Sansa,"Glory to your betrothed,See how it flames across the sky today on His  Graces name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor.The smallfolk have named  it King Joffreys Comet."
203,Joffrey,Sansa,"Ive heard servants calling it the  Dragons Tail.King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat, in the castle built by his son,He is  the dragons heir-and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign."
204,Joffrey,Robb,It means that he will triumph over his enemies.
205,Joffrey,Sansa,"You look very lovely today, my  lady,Thank you, ser."
206,Boros,Robb,Shall we go?
207,Robert,Sansa,Who do you think will win the days  honors?
208,Robert,Sansa,"I will,Yet I fear the triumph will have no savor."
209,Robert,Sansa,There is small  honor in unhorsing green boys.
210,Cersei,Sansa,"Will the queen attend, do you think?"
211,Cersei,Sansa,"I fear not, my lady.The council is meeting, some urgent business."
212,Cersei,Sansa,Lord  Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded.Her Grace is furious.
213,Myrcella,Sansa,"Lady Sansa,"
214,Sansa,Tommen,"Sansa, did you hear?"
215,Bran,Tommen,Mother said I could.
216,Joffrey,Sansa,"I fear for the life of your foeman,His foeman will be stuffed with straw,"
217,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your Grace,"
218,Joffrey,Sansa,"Pray pardon me, Your Grace.I must equip myself for the lists."
219,Joffrey,Sansa,Im pleased you wore my  stones.
220,Joffrey,Sansa,I thank you for them .
221,Joffrey,Sansa,"I pray you a lucky name day, Your Grace.Sit,Have you heard?The Beggar  King is dead.Who?"
222,Robb,Sansa,Viserys.
223,Aerys,Robb,With molten gold.
224,Aerys,Sansa,"Thats funny, dont you think?"
225,Joffrey,Sansa,"Did I tell you, I intend to  challenge him to single combat?I should like to see that, Your Grace."
226,Joffrey,Sandor,Will you enter the  lists today?
227,Joffrey,Sandor,"My lady mother said it was not fitting, since the tourney is in my honor."
228,Sandor,Sansa,"Isnt that so, dog?"
229,Sandor,Sansa,Against this lot?Why not?
230,Sandor,Sansa,"Will you joust today, my lord?"
231,Joffrey,Sansa,Wouldnt be worth the bother of arming myself.This is a  tournament of gnats.
232,Joffrey,Sansa,My dog has a fierce bark.
233,Joffrey,Sandor,To the death.
234,Joffrey,Sandor,Youd be one knight the poorer.
235,Meryn,Sansa,"Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard, "
236,Hobb,Meryn,"Ser Hobber of House Redwyne, of the Arbor,"
237,Balon,Joffrey,"Poorly ridden,Ser Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch,"
238,Balon,Joffrey,"Morros of House  Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal.Look at that upiumped oaf,"
239,Joffrey,Sansa,"Tommen, we picked the wrong foe for you,The straw knight jousts  better than that one."
240,Joffrey,Sansa,"This is a feeble show.I warned you,Gnats."
241,Joffrey,Sansa,"Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish, Ser Dontos the Red, of  House Hollard. "
242,Joffrey,Sansa,"I lose,Fetch me some wine."
243,Joffrey,Sansa,A cask from the cellars!Ill see him drowned in it.
244,Joffrey,Sansa,"No, you cant."
245,Joffrey,Sansa,What did you say?
246,Dontos,Joffrey,"Did you say I cant?Did you?Please,"
247,Dontos,Joffrey,"to, to kill a man on your  name day.Youre lying,I ought to drown you with him, if you care for him so much.I dont care for him, Your Grace."
248,Dontos,Joffrey,"Drown him or have his head  off, only ."
249,Joffrey,Sansa,"The girl speaks truly,What a man sows on his name day, he reaps throughout the  year."
250,Dontos,Sansa,"Take him away.Ill have him  killed on the morrow, the fool.He is,A fool."
251,Dontos,Sansa,He doesnt deserve the mercy of a  quick death.
252,Dontos,Sansa,Perhaps youre not so stupid as Mother says.
253,Dontos,Sansa,"Did  you hear my lady, Dontos?"
254,Dontos,Sansa,You can sleep with Moon Boy and  dress in motley.
255,Dontos,Tommen,"Thank you, Your Grace."
256,Dontos,Tommen,Thank you.
257,Dontos,Tommen,"Your Grace,shall I summon a new challenger for Brune, or proceed with the next tilt?Neither."
258,Myrcella,Tommen,Get them all out of my sight.
259,Myrcella,Tommen,"Im supposed to ride against the  straw man.Not today.But I want to ride!I dont care what you want.Mother said I could ride.She said,Mother said,Dont be childish.Were children,Were supposed to be childish."
260,Joffrey,Sandor,She has you there.
261,Joffrey,Sandor,Very well.
262,Joffrey,Sandor,"Master, bring  out the quintain, Tommen wants to be a gnat."
263,Sansa,Tommen,"Luck,"
264,Gyles,Tanda,Casterly Rock!
265,Joffrey,Myrcella,"Oh,"
266,Joffrey,Sansa,"You should go with her,Your brother might be hurt."
267,Joffrey,Sansa,What if he is?You should help him up and tell him how well he rode.
268,Joffrey,Sansa,"He got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt,Thats not riding well.Look,The boy has courage.Hes going to try again."
269,Joffrey,Tommen,Who told them to open the gate?
270,Joffrey,Myrcella,"Your Grace.You,Me,although a more courteous greeting might be in order, for an uncle and an elder.They said you were dead,"
271,Myrcella,Tyrion,"I was speaking to the king, not to his cur.Im glad youre not dead,We share that view, sweet child."
272,Sansa,Tyrion,"My lady, I am sorry for your losses.Truly,  the gods are cruel."
273,Joffrey,Sansa,"I am sorry for your loss as well, Joffrey,What loss?Your royal father?"
274,Joffrey,Sansa,"He was king  before you.Oh, him.Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.Is that what they say, Your Grace?"
275,Mordane,Sansa,"Im sorry my lady mother  took you captive, my lord.A great many people are sorry for that,"
276,Joffrey,Sansa,"Joffrey, where might I find your mother?Shes with my council,Your brother Jaime keeps losing battles."
277,Joffrey,Sansa,Hes been taken by the Starks and weve lost Riverrun and now her  stupid brother is calling himself a king.
278,Joffrey,Sansa,All sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days.
279,Joffrey,Sansa,Yes.
280,Joffrey,Sansa,"Did you bring me a gift for my name day?I did.My wits.Id sooner have Robb Starks head,Tommen, Myrcella, come."
281,Sandor,Sansa,"Id guard that tongue of yours, little man,"
282,Sandor,Sansa,"You hurt  your arm,One of your northmen hit me with a morningstar during the battle on the Green Fork.I escaped him by  falling off my horse."
283,Sandor,Sansa,"Is it grief for your lord  father that makes you so sad?My father was a traitor,And my brother and lady mother are traitors as well."
284,Sandor,Sansa,"I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.No doubt.As loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves.Lions,"
285,Joffrey,Sansa,"I am only a little lion, child, and I vow,  I shall not savage you.But now you must excuse me."
286,Mandon,Tyrion,"Her  Grace left orders, the council in session is not to be disturbed.I would be only a small disturbance, ser."
287,Mandon,Tyrion,"I bear a letter from  my father, Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King.There is his seal.Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed,"
288,Bronn,Timett,"Ser Mandon, you have not met my companions."
289,Bronn,Mandon,"Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who  was captain of Lord Arryns household guard?I know the man."
290,Bronn,Mandon,"Knew,"
291,Bronn,Mandon,"Be that as it may,I truly must see my sister  and present my letter, ser."
292,Mandon,Tyrion,You may enter.They may not.
293,Cersei,Tyrion,"You,I can see where Joffrey learned his courtesies."
294,Cersei,Tyrion,What are you doing here?
295,Cersei,Varys,Delivering a letter from our lord father.
296,Cersei,Varys,How kind of Lord  Tywin.And his scaling wax is such a lovely shade of gold.
297,Cersei,Varys,It  gives every appearance of being genuine.Of course its genuine.
298,Pycelle,Tyrion,"This is absurd,My lord father has sent my brother to sit in his place in this  council.He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King, until such time as he himself can join us."
299,Janos,Pycelle,It would seem that a  welcome is in order.Indeed.
300,Cersei,Janos,"We have sore need of you, my lord."
301,Cersei,Janos,".And whose fault is that, Lord Janos?"
302,Cersei,Janos,"Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping  order.As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle."
303,Cersei,Janos,"No, Im done with fields of battle, thank you."
304,Petyr,Tyrion,"Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and  fly bites are my favorite things."
305,Petyr,Tyrion,"Well said, Lannister.A man after my own heart. "
306,Cersei,Petyr,"Please,do let me be of service, in whatever small way I can."
307,Cersei,Petyr,How many men have you brought with you? A few hundred.
308,Cersei,Tyrion,"He is fighting a war,  after all.What use will your few hundred men be if Renly marches on the city, or Stannis sails from  Dragonstone?"
309,Tyrion,Varys,"Joffrey named our lord father.And our lord father named me.He cannot do that.Not without Joffreys consent.Lord Tywin is at Harrenhal with his host, if youd care to take it up with him,My  lords, perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister?"
310,Janos,Varys,How you must have yearned for the  sound of your sweet sisters voice.
311,Janos,Pycelle,The woes  of our troubled realm shall keep.
312,Petyr,Pycelle,"Shall I tell the steward to prepare chambers in Maegors Holdfast?My thanks, Lord Petyr, but I will be taking Lord Starks former quarters in the Tower of the Hand."
313,Petyr,Pycelle,"Youre a braver man than me, Lannister.You do know the fate of our last two  Hands?Two?If you mean to frighten me, why not say four?Four?"
314,Petyr,Pycelle,"Did the Hands before Lord Arryn meet some dire end in the  Tower?Im afraid I was too young to pay them much mind.Aerys Targaryens last Hand was killed during the Sack of Kings Landing, though I doubt hed had  time to settle into the Tower."
315,Petyr,Tyrion,"I  believe my lord father was the last Hand to depart Kings Landing with his name, properties, and parts all  intact.Fascinating,And all the more reason Id sooner bed down in the dungeon.Courage and folly are cousins, or so Ive  heard."
316,Pycelle,Tyrion,"I hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons,How I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice,How I have yearned to have that eunuchs tongue pulled out with hot pincers,Has  father lost his senses?Or did you forge this letter?"
317,Cersei,Tywin,Why would he inflict you on me?I wanted him to come himself.
318,Tyrion,Tywin,"I am Joffreys regent, and I sent him a royal command!And he ignored you,He has quite a large army, he can do that."
319,Cersei,Tyrion,Is he?
320,Cersei,Tyrion,"If I name this letter a forgery and tell them to  throw you in a dungeon, no one will ignore that, I promise you."
321,Cersei,Tyrion,"No  one,"
322,Cersei,Tyrion,"But why should you want to  throw me into a dungeon, sweet sister, when Ive come all this long way to help you? I do not require your help.It was our fathers presence that I commanded.Yes,but its Jaime you want."
323,Cersei,Tyrion,"Jaime--is my brother no less than yours,Give me your support and I promise you, we  will have Jaime freed and returned to us unharmed.How?"
324,Cersei,Tyrion,"The Stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we beheaded Lord    Eddard.True,yet you still hold his daughters, dont you? the queen said."
325,Robert,Tyrion,A great many people died that day.
326,Cersei,Tyrion,Tell me about our  friends on the council.
327,Cersei,Tyrion,"What of them?Father seems to have taken a dislike to them.When I left him, he was wondering how their heads might  look on the wall beside Lord Starks."
328,Cersei,Tyrion,"Are you certain of their  loyalty?Do you trust them?I trust no one,I need them.Does Father believe they are playing us false?Suspects, rather.Why?What does he know?"
329,Cersei,Tyrion,He knows that your sons short reign has been a long parade of follies and disasters.That suggests that someone is giving Joffrey some very bad counsel.
330,Cersei,Tyrion,Joffrey has had no lack of good counsel.
331,Cersei,Tyrion,"Now that hes king, he believes he should do as he pleases, not as hes bid.Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them,This business with Eddard Stark ."
332,Cersei,Tyrion,Joffreys work? 
333,Joffrey,Tyrion,"He was instructed to pardon Stark, to allow him to take the black."
334,Eddard,Tyrion,And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a  word from me!
335,Eddard,Tyrion,"The High Septon claims we profaned Baelors Sept with  blood, after lying to him about our intent.It would seem he has a point,So this Lord Slynt, he was part of it, was he?Tell me,  whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council?Petyr made the arrangements."
336,Sansa,Tyrion,.
337,Sansa,Tyrion,Truly?His own daughter?
338,Joffrey,Sansa,The girl was wet with love.
339,Cersei,Tyrion,"That put an end to that.His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects,Was it Joffreys wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too?"
340,Cersei,Varys,Joffrey wanted someone to blame for Roberts death.
341,Sandor,Tyrion,"We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and  a towerhouse, more than the useless old fool deserved.I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynts gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the Mud  Gate."
342,Sandor,Tyrion,"Janos should have sent more men.He is not as competent as might be  wished.Ser Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheons Kingsguard,He and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryens seven."
343,Aemon,Cersei,What do  you imagine theyll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis  Baratheon?
344,Cersei,Tyrion,"I had not considered that.Father did,That is why he sent me.To put an end to these follies and bring your son to  heel.Joffrey will be no more tractable for you than for me.He might.Why should he?He knows you would never hurt him."
345,Cersei,Tyrion,"If you believe Id ever allow you to harm my son, youre sick with fever."
346,Cersei,Tyrion,"Joffrey is as safe with me as he is with you,but so long as the boy feels threatened, hell be more inclined to listen."
347,Cersei,Tyrion,"I am your brother, you know."
348,Cersei,Tyrion,"Your son needs  me, if hes to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair."
349,Cersei,Tyrion,You have always been cunning.In my own small way.
350,Cersei,Tyrion,It may be worth the trying .
351,Eddard,Joffrey,"Do you understand?Oh, yes.Do you agree?Certainly,I am yours, sister."
352,Eddard,Joffrey,"So, now that we are of one  purpose, we ought have no more secrets between us."
353,Cersei,Petyr,Who murdered Jon Arryn? 
354,Cersei,Eddard,"How should I know?The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me.Where did she come by that notion, I  wonder?Im sure I dont know."
355,Eddard,Tyrion,That you were fucking our sweet Jaime?
356,Eddard,Tyrion,Did you think I was as blind as Father?
357,Eddard,Tyrion,Who you lie with is no matter to me  .
358,Eddard,Tyrion,although it doesnt seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other.
359,Eddard,Tyrion,"Be gentle, Cersei, Im only jesting with you."
360,Lancel,Tyrion,"I never  understood what Jaime saw in you, apart from his own reflection."
361,Lancel,Tyrion,"If you keep doing that, I may get angry."
362,Lancel,Tyrion,"Why should I care if you do?I have some new friends,You wont like them at all.How did you kill Robert?He did that himself."
363,Robert,Tyrion,"They cooked it with mushrooms and apples, and it tasted like  triumph.Truly, sister, you were born to be a widow."
364,Cersei,Robert,"Now, if you are done slapping  me, I will be off."
365,Cersei,Tyrion,I havent given you leave to depart.I want to know how you intend to free Jaime.Ill tell you when I know.
366,Cersei,Tyrion,"Right now, I have a    mind to ride through the streets and take the measure of this city."
367,Sansa,Tyrion,One parting request.
368,Sansa,Tyrion,it  would not do to lose both the daughters.
369,Timett,Tyrion,Wheres our red hand?
370,Timett,Tyrion,He felt an urge to explore.His kind was not made for waiting about in halls.I hope he doesnt kill anyone important.
371,Bronn,Moon,Try to find him.
372,Bronn,Tyrion,"I want them in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand,  but dont let the steward put the Stone Crows near the Moon Brothers, and tell him the Burned Men  must have a hall all to themselves.Where will you be?Im riding back to the Broken Anvil."
373,Bronn,Tyrion,"Need an escort?The talk is, the streets are dangerous.Ill call upon the captain of my sisters household guard, and remind him that I am no less a Lannister  than she is.He needs to recall that his oath is to Casterly Rock, not to Cersei or Joffrey."
374,Robb,Vylarr,"Captain Vylarr,I want those taken down on the morrow."
375,Robb,Vylarr,His Grace has told us he wishes the traitors heads to remain on the walls until he  fills those last three empty spikes there on the end.Let me hazard a wild stab.
376,Renly,Stannis,"Would that  be right?Yes, my lord.My nephew is thirteen years old today, Vylarr."
377,Renly,Tyrion,"Do you  take my meaning, Captain?Ill see that theyre taken down myself, my lord.Good."
378,Tyrion,Vylarr,"Fresh rats,fresh rats."
379,Tyrion,Vylarr,"There is no food coming in, is there?"
380,Tyrion,Vylarr,"Little enough,With the war in the riverlands and Lord Renly raising rebels in  Highgarden, the roads are closed to south and west.And what has my good sister done about this?She is taking steps to restore the kings peace,Lord Slynt has tripled the size of  the City Watch, and the queen has put a thousand craftsmen to work on our defenses.The stonemasons  are strengthening the walls, carpenters are building scorpions and catapults by the hundred, fletchers are  making arrows, the smiths are forging blades, and the Alchemists Guild has pledged ten thousand jars of  wildfire."
381,Cersei,Robert,Where has my sister found the coin to pay for all of this?
382,Robert,Tyrion,"Lord Petyr always finds a way, my lord.He has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city.Yes, that would work,"
383,Tyrion,Vylarr,"Take your men back to the castle,Ill be spending the night here."
384,Tyrion,Vylarr,"Will you be safe, my lord?Well, as to that, Captain, when I left the inn this morning it was full of Black Ears.One is never quite  safe when Chella daughter of Cheyk is about."
385,Shae,Tyrion,"My  good lord, I am so pleased to see you,"
386,Tyrion,Varys,Lord Varys.I had not thought to see you here.
387,Shae,Varys,"Forgive me if I intrude,I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady.Young lady,Youre half right, mlord.Im young."
388,Shae,Varys,"I fear Im the intruder, Lord Varys,When I came in, you were in  the midst of some merriment.Mlord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men to have such a  fine necklace,"
389,Chella,Varys,"And Chella told him only cowards kill the vanquished.Braver to leave the man alive, with a chance to cleanse his shame by  winning back his ear,"
390,Shae,Tyrion,Only so can you prove you do  not fear your enemies.
391,Shae,Tyrion,"And then mlord says if he was a Black Ear hed never sleep, for dreams of one-eared  men.A problem I will never need face,Im terrified of my enemies, so I kill them all."
392,Tyrion,Varys,"Will you take some wine with us, my lord?Ill take some wine."
393,Shae,Varys,"I always like to return to the city through the Gate of the Gods,The carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite, they make me weep each time I see them."
394,Shae,Tyrion,"They almost seem to follow you as you ride beneath the portcullis.I never noticed, mlord,Ill look again on the morrow, if it please you."
395,Tyrion,Varys,"Do be careful, child,Kings Landing is not wholly safe these days."
396,Shae,Varys,Men with cold steel and colder hearts.
397,Shae,Varys,"If they try and bother me, theyll be one ear short when Chella runs them off."
398,Tyrion,Varys,"Your young lady has an amiable way to her.I should take very good  care of her if I were you.I intend to.Any man who tries to harm her-well, Im too small to be a Black Ear, and I make no claims  to courage."
399,Tyrion,Varys,I will leave you.
400,Tyrion,Varys,I know how weary you must be.
401,Tyrion,Varys,"Have you seen the comet? Im short, not blind,"
402,Tyrion,Varys,"In the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,They say it comes as a herald before a king,  to warn of fire and blood to follow."
403,Tyrion,Varys,"May I leave you  with a bit of a riddle, Lord Tyrion?"
404,Tyrion,Varys,"In a room sit three great men, a king,  a priest, and a rich man with his gold."
405,Chella,Shae,So tell me-who lives and who dies?
406,Shae,Tyrion,The rich man lives.Doesnt he?
407,Shae,Tyrion,Perhaps.
408,Shae,Tyrion,"That would depend on the sellsword, it seems."
409,Shae,Tyrion,"Come, lets go upstairs."
410,Shae,Tyrion,Did you miss me?
411,Shae,Tyrion,"Desperately,"
412,Shae,Tyrion,"Youll miss me all the time in your Red Keep,All alone in your  cold bed in your Tower of the Hand.Too true."
413,Baelor,Shae,"You wont be far,Youll have a house, with guards and servants, and Ill visit as often as Im able."
414,Shae,Tyrion,"Youll never be able to rest,Youll think of me every time  you go to bed.-she grinned that wicked grin Tyrion liked so well-"
415,Baelor,Tyrion,"My lion,My sweet lord, my giant of Lannister."
416,Shae,Tyrion,"So what will you do, mlord, now that youre the Hand of the King?"
417,Shae,Tyrion,"Something Cersei will never expect,Ill do ."
418,Shae,Tyrion,justice.
419,Nan,Walder,"Though it is stronger in some than in others,"
420,Bran,Rodrik,Who can know the mind of a wolf?
421,Bran,Rodrik,"Its freedom theyre calling for,They dont like being walled up, and whos to blame them?Wild things  belong in the wild, not in a castle.They want to hunt,A wolf  smells bettern any man.Like as not, theyve caught the scent o prey."
422,Bran,Luwin,Wolves often howl at the moon.
423,Bran,Osha,Perchance they think it is the moon.
424,Bran,Osha,"Your wolves have more wit than your maester,They know truths the grey man has forgotten.Blood and fire, boy, and nothing  sweet."
425,Bran,Nan,"It is the sword that slays the season,"
426,Bran,Nan,"Dragons,"
427,Bran,Nan,"It  be dragons, boy,"
428,Hodor,Nan,Hodor.
429,Bran,Nan,"Oooo,"
430,Bran,Hayhead,"Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo, "
431,Bran,Robb,"Whats this, my prince?"
432,Hayhead,Robb,Oooooooo.Oo-oo-oooooooooooo. 
433,Hayhead,Luwin,Now you stop that there.oo-oo-ooooo.oo-oo-oooooooooooooooo. 
434,Bran,Luwin,"Bran, those beasts make sufficient noise without your help."
435,Bran,Mikken,"The hour grows late, you ought to be fast asleep.Im talking to the wolves."
436,Bran,Mikken,Shall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed?I can get to bed myself.
437,Bran,Mikken,"Anyway, I dont have to sleep if I dont want to.All men must sleep, Bran.Even princes.When I sleep I turn into a wolf."
438,Bran,Mikken,"Do  wolves dream?All creatures dream, I think, yet not as men do.Do dead men dream?"
439,Bran,Luwin,"Some say yes, some no,The dead themselves are silent on the matter.Do trees dream?Trees?"
440,Bran,Luwin,".They do,They dream tree dreams."
441,Bran,Luwin,"I smell things, and  sometimes I can taste the blood."
442,Bran,Walder,"If you would only spend more time with the  other children-I hate the other children,I commanded you to send them away."
443,Luwin,Walder,"The Freys are your lady mothers wards, sent here to be fostered at her express  command."
444,Luwin,Rickon,"If we turned them out, where would they go?Home.Its their fault you wont let me have Summer.The Frey boy did not ask to be attacked,no more than I did.That was Shaggydog."
445,Bran,Rickon,"Summer  never bit anyone.Summer ripped out a mans throat in this very chamber, or have you forgotten?"
446,Bran,Rickon,The Frey boys are  wise to be wary of them.We should put the Walders in the godswood.
447,Arya,Bran,"I wanted to ride Dancer,  but Alebelly wouldnt let me past the gate.And rightly so."
448,Arya,Bran,"Would you    want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the Lannisters?Summer would save me,Princes should be allowed to sail the sea and hunt  boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances.Bran, child, why do you torment yourself so?One day you may do some of these things, but now you  are only a boy of eight.Id sooner be a wolf."
449,Bran,Luwin,. 
450,Bran,Luwin,Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.
451,Bran,Luwin,"A true prince would welcorne-AAHOOOOOOO,AAHAs you will, child."
452,Rickon,Walder,"We have  our own names at Winterfell,"
453,Rickon,Walder,"I am the lord of the crossing, who goes there?"
454,Chett,Jacelyn,"Maybaps,MayhapsMayhaps."
455,Big,Walder,Mayhaps.
456,Big,Walder,"Hes fifty-two days older than me,so he was bigger at first, but I grew faster.Were cousins, not brothers,Im Walder son of Jammos."
457,Big,Walder,"Hes ahead of me in the line of succession even though Im older.Only by fifty-two days,And neither of us will ever hold the Twins, stupid.I will,Were not the only Walders either."
458,Big,Walder,"Plus theres girls named  Walda.And Tyr.You always forget Tyr.Hes Waltyr, not Walder,And hes after us, so he doesnt matter.Anyhow, I  never liked him."
459,Bran,Walder,"Maybaps,"
460,Chett,Jacelyn,
461,Rickon,Walder,I want to play!
462,Rickon,Walder,"No, Shaggy,Wolves cant play.You stay with Bran."
463,Dontos,Loras,
464,Hodor,Rickon,Hodor!
465,Bran,Rickon,You had no right!
466,Bran,Rickon,"That was  our place, a Stark place!"
467,Hayhead,Osha,"Ive made you a sleeping draught, Bran."
468,Bran,Luwin,"This will give you dreamless sleep,Sweet,  dreamless sleep.It will?"
469,Bran,Luwin,Yes.Drink.
470,Bran,Luwin,"Come the morn, youll feel better."
471,Bran,Osha,Is it the wolf dreams again?
472,Bran,Osha,"You should not fight so hard, boy."
473,Bran,Osha,Might be the gods are trying to  talk back.The gods?
474,Syrio,Yoren,"Fools!Theyll kill you,    fools!"
475,Arya,Yoren,"Its war, theyll take what they want, youll do better  selling to me, my friend."
476,Arya,Yoren,"Arms like yours, might be you  can learn to use this,"
477,Arya,Yoren,"Well sleep outside, same as ever, but they got a bathhouse  here, if any of you feels the need o hot water and a lick o soap."
478,Lommy,Yoren,"I had a brother took the black, years ago."
479,Arya,Yoren,You get pepper on the Wall?
480,Arya,Yoren,Shame.Lync loved that pepper.
481,Sansa,Yoren,"Youll be back soon enough,Theres no going  north."
482,Arya,Yoren,"One bunch  rides off at dawn and another one shows up by dusk.Thats nothing to us,Tully or Lannister, makes no matter.The Watch takes  no part."
483,Arya,Yoren,"Its more than Lannister and Tully,Theres wild men down from the Mountains of  the Moon, try telling them you take no part."
484,Arya,Robb,.
485,Arya,Robb,"I heard the boy rides to battle on a wolf,Fools talk."
486,Robb,Yoren,"The man I heard it from, he saw it himself.A wolf big as a horse, he swore.Swearing dont make it true, Hod,You keep swearing youll pay what you owe  me, and Ive yet to see a copper."
487,Robb,Yoren,"Its been a bad year for wolves,Around the  Gods Eye, the packs have grown boldern anyone can remember."
488,Arya,Jory,"Its worth your life to go into those woods by night.Ah, thats more tales, and no more true than the other.I heard the same thing from my cousin, and shes not the sort to lie,She says  theres this great pack, hundreds of them, mankillers.The one that leads them is a she-wolf, a bitch from  the seventh hell."
489,Alliser,Bronn,
490,Arya,Yoren,"Not one of those dogs came  back, not one.Thats just a story,Wolves dont eat babies.And what would you know about it, lad?"
491,Arya,Yoren,"The boys greensick on beer, thats all    it is.No Im not."
492,Arya,Yoren,".Outside, boy ."
493,Arya,Yoren,and see that you stay there until you learn to shut your mouth when men are talking.
494,Arya,Yoren,Go on now.See that the  stableboy has watered our horses.
495,Arya,Yoren,"They dont,"
496,Arya,Yoren,"Boy,Lovely boy."
497,Arya,Chett,"A man could use another taste of beer.A man  has a thirst, wearing these heavy bracelets."
498,Arya,Chett,"A man could use a bath too,A boy could make a friend.I have friends,None I can see,"
499,Arya,Syrio,"Stop that,A man does not choose his companions in the black cells,"
500,Rorge,Syrio,"These two, they have no courtesy."
501,Rorge,Syrio,"You are called Arry, is that not so?Lumpyhead,Lumpyhead Lumpyface Stickboy.Have a care, Lorath, hell hit  you with his stick.A man must be ashamed of the company he keeps, Arry,This man has the  honor to be Jaqen Hghar, once of the Free City of Lorath."
502,Biter,Rorge,-he waved his tankard at the noseless man-
503,Biter,Rorge,"A man must have some  name, is that not so?"
504,Arya,Biter,Are you charmed?
505,Arya,Biter,No.
506,Arya,Rorge,A man must weep.
507,Arya,Syrio,"You get us some beer, pimple.Now!You shut your mouth!"
508,Arya,Syrio,"Come closer,and Ill shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody."
509,Arya,Jaqen,"A boy has more courage than sense,"
510,Arya,Rorge,What are you doing?
511,Arya,Rorge,"Yoren said none of us should go near those three.They dont scare me,Then youre stupid.They scare me."
512,Arya,Rorge,Lets get away from them.
513,Biter,Rorge,Want to fight?
514,Arya,Biter,"Id hurt you.You would not.You dont know how strong I am.You dont know how quick I am.Youre asking for it, Arry."
515,Arya,Biter,"This is cheap steel, but its a real sword."
516,Arya,Biter,"This is good steel, so its realer than yours."
517,Arya,Biter,Promise not to cry if I cut you?Ill promise if you will.
518,Arya,Syrio,Whats wrong?Gold cloaks.
519,Syrio,Yoren,What is it?
520,Syrio,Yoren,"What are you doing?Let go.Quiet as a shadow,"
521,Arya,Yoren,"You  men,You the ones left to take the black?We might be,Wed rather join you boys,We hear its cold on that Wall."
522,Arya,Yoren,I have a warrant for a certain boy-Who is it wants this boy?
523,Arya,Yoren,Why are we hiding?
524,Arya,Yoren,"Its me they want,"
525,Arya,Yoren,"You be quiet.The queen wants him, old man, not that its your concern,Here, Her Graces seal and warrant."
526,Arya,Yoren,"Why would the queen want you, Arry?"
527,Arya,Yoren,Be quiet!
528,Arya,Yoren,Pretty.
529,Arya,Yoren,"Thing is, the boys in  the Nights Watch now.What he done back in the city dont mean piss-all.The queens not interested in your views, old man, and neither am I,Ill have the boy."
530,Meryn,Yoren,"Youll have no one,Theres laws on such things."
531,Meryn,Yoren,Heres your law.
532,Cutjack,Yoren,"Thats no law, just a sword.Happens I got one too."
533,Cutjack,Yoren,Old fool.I have five men with me.
534,Cutjack,Yoren,Happens I got thirty.
535,Cutjack,Yoren,This lot?
536,Cutjack,Yoren,Whos first?
537,Cutjack,Yoren,"I am.No, I am,Me."
538,Cutjack,Hot,Me and him.
539,Cutjack,Hot,"All of us,"
540,Arya,Hot,Is it a fight?
541,Arya,Hot,"I guess,"
542,Arya,Syrio,You girls put away them rocks and sticks  before you get spanked.None of you knows what end of a sword to hold.I do!
543,Arya,Syrio,"Put the blade away, little girl, no one  wants to hurt you.Im not a girl!"
544,Syrio,Yoren,Im the one you want.Hes the one we want.
545,Hot,Yoren,"Neithers the one you get, less you want me to  see if your apples ripe yet."
546,Hot,Yoren,"I    was you, Id let loose of that gutcutter, spread my cheeks over that fat little horse, and gallop on back to  the city."
547,Hot,Yoren,Now.
548,Hot,Yoren,"Well just keep that,Good steels always needed on the Wall.As you say."
549,Hot,Yoren,Men.
550,Hot,Yoren,"Youd best scamper up to  that Wall of yours in a hurry, old man.The next time I catch you, I believe Ill have your head to go with the bastard boys.Better men than you have tried."
551,Hot,Yoren,Fool!
552,Arya,Hot,"Ride all night, maybe we can stay ahead o them for a bit."
553,Arya,Hot,Who wants this?Me!
554,Arya,Hot,Dont be using it on Arry.
555,Arya,Hot,"Queen wants you bad, boy."
556,Arya,Hot,Why should she want him?
557,Arya,Hot,"Why should she want you?Youre nothing but a little gutter rat!Well, youre nothing but a bastard boy!"
558,Arya,Hot,"Whats your true name?Gendry,Dont see why no one wants neither o you,"
559,Arya,Jon,"The rest o  us dont mean spit to them.Except for you,That man said hed take your head too.Well, as to that,if he can get it off my shoulders, hes welcome to it."
560,Arya,Jon,Samwell
561,Jon,Samwell,Have you been here all night?Have I?
562,Rast,Samwell,"You didnt break your fast with us, and your bed hadnt been slept in."
563,Jon,Samwell,"Is it morning?Down here theres no way to know.Samwell youre a sweet fool,Youll miss that bed when were sleeping on the cold hard ground,  I promise you."
564,Jon,Samwell,Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander.
565,Jon,Samwell,There are thousands!
566,Jon,Samwell,"The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred.Did you find the maps?Oh, yes."
567,Jon,Samwell,"A dozen, at the least."
568,Jon,Samwell,"The paint has faded,  but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages, and theres another book ."
569,Jon,Samwell,I was reading it a moment ago.
570,Jon,Samwell,"This,"
571,Jon,Samwell,"Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest, its all here."
572,Jon,Samwell,"He drew maps as well, see ."
573,Jon,Samwell,".Maybe you could write an account of our ranging, Samwell"
574,Jon,Samwell,Theres more  maps.
575,Jon,Samwell,"well, years, in truth.Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that."
576,Jon,Samwell,"Look, this one is crumbling,Be gentle."
577,Jon,Samwell,"The important books used to be copied over when they needed them.Some of the  oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably.Well, dont bother copying that one."
578,Jon,Samwell,".An inventory,or perhaps a bill of sale.Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago?"
579,Jon,Samwell,I would.
580,Jon,Samwell,"You can learn so  much from ledgers like that, truly you can."
581,Jon,Samwell,".They ate food,and they lived as we live.Youd be surprised.This vault is a treasure, Jon.If you say so."
582,Jon,Qhorin,"I do,"
583,Jon,Qhorin,"I found drawings of the faces in the trees, and a book about the tongue of the  children of the forest ."
584,Qhorin,Samwell,.The books will still be here when we return.if we return .
585,Qhorin,Samwell,".The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of them rangers."
586,Qhorin,Samwell,Youll be as safe as if you were back  in your lord fathers castle at Horn Hill.
587,Jon,Samwell,I was never very safe in my fathers castle either.
588,Aemon,Samwell,"We need you for the ravens, Samwell And someone  has to help me keep Grenn humble."
589,Aemon,Samwell,"You could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or anyone,I could show you how.  "
590,Benjen,Samwell,Youre a brother of the Nights Watch now.A brother of the Nights Watch shouldnt be so scared.Were all scared.Wed be fools if we werent.
591,Jon,Samwell,"Theres no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it.Come, Ill help you gather up the maps."
592,Grenn,Samwell,"The comets so bright you can see it by day now,Never mind about comets, its maps the Old Bear wants."
593,Jon,Samwell,"Do what you want,I took a vow."
594,Donal,Jon,"What do you make of them, Snow?"
595,Jon,Samwell,"They smell of summer,Where  did Conwy find them?A lords dungeon near Gulltown,A brigand, a barber, a beggar, two orphans, and a  boy whore.With such do we defend the realms of men.Theyll do."
596,Jon,Samwell,We did.
597,Jon,Samwell,Youve heard these tidings of your brother?Last night.
598,Jon,Robb,"Robb will make a good king,Will he now?"
599,Jon,Steffon,"I hope thats so, boy, but once I might have said the same  of Robert.They say you forged his warhammer,Aye."
600,Jon,Stannis,Hang them up and they go to rust.And his brothers?
601,Jon,Stannis,Robert was the true steel.
602,Jon,Robb,"And Renly, that one, hes    copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day."
603,Jon,Renly,"Lord Mormont awaits us,I wont keep you from the Old Bear."
604,Jon,Renly,"May the gods go  with you on the morrow, Snow.You bring back that uncle of yours, you hear?We will,"
605,Jon,Samwell,"More stairs,I hate stairs.Well, thats one thing we wont face in the wood."
606,Samwell,Thoren,Snow!
607,Small,Thoren,Took you long enough with those maps.
608,Small,Thoren,Put them here.Ill have a look at them later.
609,Alliser,Small,"The Lord Commanders place is at Castle Black, lording and commanding,it seems to me."
610,Alliser,Small,"Me, me, me.If you are ever Lord Commander, you may do as you please,but it seems  to me that I have not died yet, nor have the brothers put you in my place.Im First Ranger now, with Ben Stark lost and Ser Jaremy killed,The  command should be mine."
611,Alliser,Small,"I sent out Ben Stark, and Ser Wayrnar before him.I do not mean to  send you after them and sit wondering how long I must wait before I give you up for lost as well."
612,Jon,Small,And Stark remains First Ranger until we know for a certainty that he is dead.
613,Jon,Small,"We ride at first light,  or have you forgotten?"
614,Jon,Small,As my lord commands.
615,Jon,Samwell,First Ranger!
616,Jon,Samwell,"Do I look old to you, boy?"
617,Jon,Samwell,Do I look frail?
618,Jon,Samwell,"No, my lord,You look strong as a ."
619,Jon,Samwell,"Dont cozen me, Snow, you know I wont have it.Let me have a look at these maps."
620,Jon,Samwell,Was this all you could find?I .
621,Jon,Samwell," Samwellstammered, "
622,Jon,Samwell,".These are old,Old, old.The villages may come and go, but the hills and rivers will be in the same places,True enough.Have you chosen your ravens yet, Tarly?M-m-maester Aemon m-means to p-pick them come evenfall, after the f-f-feeding.Ill have his best.Smart birds, and strong.Strong,Strong, strong.If it happens that were all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where and how we  died."
623,Jon,Samwell,"Tarly, when I  was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open, a weasel was  like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat."
624,Jon,Samwell,"Otherwise,  beware of weasels."
625,Jon,Samwell,"Off with you, Im too busy for folly.No doubt the  maester has some work you can do."
626,Jon,Samwell,Is that boy as big a fool as he seems?
627,Jon,Renly,"Fool,"
628,Jon,Renly,"His lord father stands high in King Renlys  councils,  and I had half a notion to dispatch him ."
629,Jon,Renly,"Hes a deal steadier, and his mother was one of the green-apple Fossoways.If it please my lord, what would you have of King Renly?The same things Id have of all of them, lad."
630,Jon,Renly,"the Nights Watch is not proud, we take what is offered."
631,Jon,Renly,"If the winds have been kind, Ser Alliser should reach Kings Landing by  the turn of the moon, but whether this boy Joffrey will pay him any heed, I do not know.House Lannister  has never been a friend to the Watch.Thorne has the wights hand to show them."
632,Jon,Scar,"Would that we had another hand to send to Renly.Dywen says you can find anything beyond the Wall.Aye, Dywen says.And the last time he went ranging, he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall."
633,Jon,Scar,My sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover.
634,Jon,Scar,Ive not seen any giant bears.
635,Jon,Scar,But we  were speaking of hands.How is yours?Better.
636,Aemon,Jon,"It itches, though."
637,Aemon,Jon,He gave me a salve to take with me when we ride.You can wield Longclaw despite the pain?Well enough.
638,Aemon,Jon,"Im to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon said.Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what hes about."
639,Daeron,Jon,Do you know that he might have been king?
640,Daeron,Jon,"He told me his father was king, but not ."
641,Daeron,Jon,I thought him perhaps a younger  son.So he was.
642,Aemon,Daeron,"Mind you, all this happened long  before I was born, ancient as Smallwood would make me.Maester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight.So he was."
643,Aemon,Jon,and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well.
644,Arya,Jon,"Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir apparent, was slain  in a tourney mishap."
645,Aerys,Jon,"King Daeron was also taken, so the crown passed to Daerons second son, Aerys.The Mad King?"
646,Aerys,Robert,"No, this was Aerys the First.The one Robert deposed was the second of that name.How long ago was this?Eighty years or close enough,"
647,Jon,Nan,The next brother was Aerion.Aerion the Monstrous?
648,Jon,Nan,The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon
649,Bran,Nan,"The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame."
650,Aemon,Jon,"Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord."
651,Aemon,Jon,"That was the year of the Great Council,The lords passed over  Prince Aerions infant son and Prince Daerons daughter and gave the crown to Aegon.Yes and no."
652,Aemon,Jon,"And here he has remained, while his brother and his  brothers son and his son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the  Dragonkings.King, "
653,Aemon,Jon,"King,He likes that word,An easy word to say.An easy word to like.King,I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.The realm has three kings already, and thats two too many for my liking."
654,Aemon,Jon,"My lord, why have you told me this, about Maester Aemon?Must I have a reason?"
655,Aemon,Jon,Your brother Robb has been crowned  King in the North.
656,Aemon,Jon,"A king for a brother.And this too,A vow.Give me  a man for every vow Ive seen broken and the Wall will never lack for defenders.Ive always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell."
657,Jon,Robb,"A lords one thing, a  kings another."
658,Jon,Robb,"They will garb your brother  Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail."
659,Jon,Robb,"and Ill  name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it."
660,Jon,Robb,"And if it did trouble me, what might I do, bastard as I am?What will you do?"
661,Catelyn,Jon,"Bastard as you are?Be troubled,and keep my vows."
662,Robin,Theon,"Your Grace,  here is the man you asked for,Kneel before the king, Lannister!"
663,Emmon,Walder,"Rise, Ser Cleos."
664,Greatjon,Robb,"Thank you, my lord.Your Grace,"
665,Catelyn,Cleos,"Your Grace,Pardons."
666,Cleos,Jaime,"I brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in Kings Landing.Youll travel under a peace banner, with thirty of my best men to escort you."
667,Cleos,Walder,"Then I should be most glad to bring His Graces message to the queen.Understand,"
668,Catelyn,Cleos,"I want your pledge, on your honor as a knight, that after you deliver my message youll  return with the queens reply, and resume your captivity."
669,Catelyn,Cleos,"I do so vow.Every man in this hall has heard you,If you do not return, the whole  realm will know you forsworn.I will do as I pledged,What is this message? An offer of peace."
670,Catelyn,Robb,"Tell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms, I will sheath this sword, and make an end to  the war between us."
671,Rickard,Robb,"Olyvar, the  paper,"
672,Robb,Sansa,"First, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from  Kings Landing to White Harbor."
673,Catelyn,Joffrey,"When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell, I  will release the queens cousins, the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey, and give them  safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered."
674,Catelyn,Eddard,"Secondly, my lord fathers bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his brother and sister in  the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he would have wished.The remains of the men of his household guard  who died in his service at Kings Landing must also be returned."
675,Edmure,Robert,"Third, my fathers greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun."
676,Edmure,Theon,"Fourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release  those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the  Trident.Once he does so, I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle  of the Camps, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will remain my hostage for his fathers good behavior."
677,Catelyn,Greatjon,"Lastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north."
678,Catelyn,Greatjon,"Our domain  shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident  and its vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the  east.THE KING IN THE NORTH!"
679,Greatjon,Robb,Stark!
680,Robb,Tywin,"Maester Vyman has drawn a map, showing the borders we claim."
681,Greatjon,Robb,"So long as the terms of this pact are abided with  faithfully, I shall release two hostages every year, and return them safely to their families."
682,Greatjon,Robb,There are the terms.
683,Greatjon,Robb," - he whistled, and Grey Wind moved forward snarling - "
684,Cleos,Greatjon,"Stark, Stark, King in the  North!"
685,Cleos,Robb,"The queen shall hear your message, my-Your Grace.Good,Ser Robin, see that he has a good meal and clean clothing.Hes to ride at first  light.As you command, Your Grace,Then we are done."
686,Catelyn,Robb,"You did well,though that business with  the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king."
687,Catelyn,Robb,"Did you see the look on his face, Mother?"
688,Olyvar,Robb,"What I saw was Lord Karstark, walking out.As did ITake this thing back to my  bedchamber.At once, Your Grace."
689,Edmure,Olyvar,"Ill wager there were others who felt the same as Lord Karstark,How  can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my fathers domains, stealing his  crops and slaughtering his people?I say again, we ought to be marching on Harrenhal.We lack the strength,"
690,Catelyn,Edmure,Do we grow stronger sitting here?Our host dwindles every day.And whose doing is that?
691,Jason,Robb,"You cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and their people put to    the sword,but Lord Karstark is a northman. said Robb."
692,Catelyn,Robb,".More bloodshed will not bring your father back to us, or Lord Rickards sons,An offer  had to be madethough a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms.Any sweeter and I would have gagged."
693,Catelyn,Rickard,"Cersei Lannister will never consent to trade your sisters for a pair of  cousins.Its her brother shell want, as you know full well."
694,Catelyn,Robb,"I cant release the Kingslayer, not even if I wanted to.My lords would never abide it.Your lords made you their king.And can unmake me just as easy.If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly."
695,Catelyn,Robb,   Robb finished.
696,Catelyn,Robb,Will they deserve their deaths as well?   Robb said.
697,Catelyn,Robb,"But I wont free him, not even for Arya and  Sansa."
698,Edmure,Robb,"Are you afraid to have Jaime Lannister in the field  again, is that the truth of it?"
699,Catelyn,Robb,"Cat, dont.The boy has the right of this.Dont call me the boy,Im almost a man grown, and a king-your king, ser."
700,Jaime,Robb,.
701,Blue,Robb,"I might have been able to trade the Kingslayer for  Father, but .. "
702,Blue,Robb,but not for the girls?
703,Blue,Robb,"Girls are not important enough, are they?"
704,Eddard,Robb,"Ill do all I can for my sisters,If the queen has any sense, shell accept my terms.If not, Ill  make her rue the day she refused me."
705,Catelyn,Robb,"Mother, are you certain you will not consent to go to the  Twins?You would be farther from the fighting, and you could acquaint yourself with Lord Freys  daughters to help me choose my bride when the war is done."
706,Catelyn,Robb,"Youre old enough to decide which of Lord Walders girls  you prefer without your mothers help, Robb.Then go with Theon."
707,Catelyn,Stevron,Bran and Rickon need you.
708,Catelyn,Stevron,"My lord father has little enough time remaining him.So  long as your grandfather lives, my place is at Riverrun with him.I could command you to go."
709,Catelyn,Stevron,I could.
710,Catelyn,Stevron,"Ill say again, I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke, and kept Theon  close to you.Who better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son?Jason Mallister,Tytos Blackwood."
711,Catelyn,Stevron,but not Theon.
712,Bran,Catelyn,Theons  fought bravely for us.
713,Bran,Catelyn,"If the  Lannisters wont make peace, Ill have need of Lord Greyjoys longships.Youll have them sooner if you keep his son as hostage.Hes been a hostage half his life.For good reason,Balon Greyjoy is not a man to be trusted."
714,Catelyn,Robb,He may aspire to wear one again.
715,Catelyn,Robb,I will not grudge him that.
716,Robb,Theon,"Ill give him a crown gladly, so long as he helps us bring down the Lannisters.Robb-"
717,Robb,Theon,"Grey Wind, come."
718,Catelyn,Robb,"I am going to visit Father,Come  with me, Edmure.I need to have a word with those new bowmen Ser Desmond is training.Ill visit him later."
719,Brynden,Robb,"Does Robb know you are returned,  Uncle?"
720,Brynden,Robb,No.
721,Brynden,Robb,His Grace will  want to hear my tidings in private first Id think.
722,Brynden,Robb,How is he?
723,Brynden,Robb,Much the same.
724,Brynden,Robb,He seems weaker with each day that passes.Does he speak?Yes .
725,Brynden,Robb,"Once he called me by Mothers name.He misses her still,You have her face."
726,Brynden,Catelyn,.You remember more of her than I do.It has been a long time.
727,Catelyn,Hoster,"Each time I ride out, I wonder if I shall find him alive or dead on my return."
728,Catelyn,Hoster,At least you made your peace with him.
729,Catelyn,Hoster,You spoke of tidings that Robb needed to  hear?
730,Brynden,Hoster,Come outside.Best if we do not wake him.
731,Brynden,Catelyn,You can see it by day now.
732,Brynden,Catelyn,but what is the message?
733,Brynden,Catelyn,"The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red  flag of vengeance for Eddard.Edmure thinks its an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long  tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue."
734,Brynden,Catelyn,"I wish I had their faith.Crimson is a Lannister  color.That things not crimson,Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river."
735,Brynden,Marq,Our blood or theirs?Was there ever a war where only one side bled?
736,Brynden,Marq,The riverlands  are awash in blood and flame all around the Gods Eye.
737,Catelyn,Tywin,"Its said that Ser Burton Crakehall was  boasting that hed slain Dondarrion, until he led his column into one of Lord Berics traps and got every  man of them killed.Some of Eddards guard from Kings Landing are with this Lord Beric,May the gods  preserve them.Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve themselves, if the tales  be true,"
738,Catelyn,Gregor,"Darry men recaptured their lords  keep but held it less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on them and put the whole  garrison to the sword, even their lord."
739,Catelyn,Gregor,"Darry was only a child.Aye, and the last of his line as well."
740,Catelyn,Gregor,"That beasts head would make a noble gift for all the people  of the realm, I vow.Dont speak to me of heads, Uncle."
741,Cersei,Tywin,Clegane is no more than Lord Tywins  catspaw.
742,Brynden,Catelyn,"True enough,And Tywin Lannister is no mans fool."
743,Catelyn,Jaime,"it would  sicken even the dead.When Edmure hears this, he will rage.And that will be just as Lord Tywin desires."
744,Catelyn,Jaime,"Lannister wants to  provoke us to battle.Robb is like to give him that wish,He is restless as a cat sitting here, and Edmure  and the Greatjon and the others will urge him on."
745,Brynden,Tywin,More fool they.
746,Harren,Tywin,He wants us to march  on Harrenhal.Harrenhal.
747,Harren,Nan,"And  King Harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against dragons,For dragons fly."
748,Catelyn,Harren,"I would not have Robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep,Yet we must do  something, Uncle.And soon,I have not told you the worst of it, child.The men I sent west have    brought back word that a new host is gathering at Casterly Rock."
749,Chett,Jacelyn,Robb must be told at once.
750,Brynden,Robb,Another nephew?
751,Brynden,Stafford,"Cousin,Brother to Lord Tywins late wife, so twice related.An old man and  a bit of a dullard, but he has a son, Ser Daven, who is more formidable.Then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field.We have some time yet before we must face them."
752,Brynden,Catelyn,He  will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal.Unless .
753,Brynden,Catelyn,.
754,Brynden,Catelyn,Yes?
755,Brynden,Catelyn,"Unless he must leave Harrenhal,to face some other threat."
756,Brynden,Catelyn,Lord Renly.King Renly.
757,Brynden,Catelyn,Perhaps.
758,Brynden,Janos,"Hell want something, though.Hell want what kings always want,Homage."
759,Janos,Tyrion,More wine?
760,Janos,Tyrion,"I should not object,"
761,Janos,Tyrion,I should not object at all.
762,Janos,Tyrion,From the Arbor?Dornish.
763,Janos,Small,"Quite the find.Dornish wines  are not often so rich.Rich,"
764,Janos,Tyrion,"Yes, rich, thats the very word I was searching for, the very word."
765,Janos,Tyrion,"Droll, yes.Im pleased you think so ."
766,Janos,Tyrion,"A simple Tyrion will suffice for me, Lord  Janos.As you wish."
767,Janos,Tyrion,"No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal,For a certainty.Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service, what do you say?Wars have been fought over less,Youre a bold man to  take Harrenhal for your seat."
768,Harren,Tyrion,And some say cursed  as well.Should I fear a pile of stone?
769,Harren,Tyrion,"A bold man, you said."
770,Harren,Tyrion,"Small,  mayhap, but bold. You are too kind.More wine?No."
771,Alla,Tyrion,A bold man drinks his fill!Truly.
772,Alla,Tyrion,I have been glancing over the names you put forward  to take your place as Commander of the City Watch.Good men.
773,Allar,Tyrion,If he pleases the king.To be sure.
774,Balon,Tyrion,I had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater.
775,Janos,Robert,And yet his name does not appear on your list.
776,Janos,Robert,Bywater.
777,Janos,Tyrion,"A poor trade, if you ask  me, a hand for a ser."
778,Janos,Tyrion,"Ser Jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor, as I see it."
779,Janos,Tyrion,"Allar Deems the man for you.Deem is little loved in the streets, I am told.Hes feared.Thats better.What was it I heard of him?Some trouble in a brothel?That."
780,Shae,Tyrion,He  warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty.Still .
781,Shae,Tyrion,"mothers and children, he might have expected shed try to save the babe."
782,Shae,Tyrion,"Have  some of this cheese, it goes splendidly with the wine.Tell me, why did you choose Deem for that  unhappy task?A good commander knows his men, Tyrion."
783,Shae,Tyrion,"Even if it was only some  whore and her whelp.I suppose thats so,"
784,Renly,Tyrion,"A hard man for a hard job, is Deem.Does as hes told, and never a word  afterward."
785,Renly,Tyrion,This is fine.
786,Renly,Tyrion,Give me a good sharp knife and a good  sharp cheese and Im a happy man.
787,Renly,Tyrion,Enjoy it while you can.
788,Janos,Tyrion,So who sent you after the whores bastard?
789,Janos,Tyrion,"Youre a sly  one, Tyrion."
790,Janos,Tyrion,"Never a question, and never a word afterward, not with  me.As with Deem.Just the same.You make him your Commander when Im off to Harrenhal, and you wont regret it."
791,Janos,Jeor,"Whoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into your armor, I can tell.Lord Mormont  faces the same problem."
792,Janos,Jeor,I thought she was a lady.
793,Janos,Jeor,"Beds down with bears, thats the  one?It was her brother I was speaking of."
794,Janos,Tyrion,The Watch gets so few good men these days.
795,Janos,Tyrion,"Hed sleep easier if he  had a man like you, I imagine.Or the valiant Allar Deem."
796,Janos,Tyrion,"Small chance of that!One would think,"
797,Baelor,Janos,  
798,Janos,Tyrion,A pity I wasnt here to see it.They say even Varys was surprised.
799,Janos,Tyrion,"The Spider,Knows everything, they say.Well, he  didnt know that.How could he?"
800,Janos,Tyrion,"He had helped persuade my sister that  Stark should be pardoned, on the condition that he take the black.Eh?"
801,Janos,Tyrion,"My sister Cersei,The Queen Regent.Yes."
802,Janos,Tyrion,"As to that, well ."
803,Janos,Tyrion,"The king himself.The king is thirteen,Still.He is the king."
804,Janos,Tyrion,"The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.Well, one or two of them, at least,Might I have a look at your spear?My spear?"
805,Janos,Tyrion,The clasp that fastens your cape.
806,Janos,Tyrion,"We have goldsmiths in Lannisport who do better work,[]he opined.The red enamel blood is a shade  much, if you dont mind my saying.Tell me, my lord, did you drive the spear into the mans back yourself,  or did you only give the command?I gave the command, and Id give it again.Lord Stark was a traitor."
807,Jacelyn,Tyrion,The  man tried to buy me.Little dreaming that you had already been sold.
808,Jacelyn,Janos,Are you drunk?
809,Jacelyn,Janos,.What honor is that?
810,Jacelyn,Janos,"A lordship and a castle for  a spear thrust in the back, and you didnt even need to thrust the spear."
811,Janos,Tyrion,"I mislike the tone of your voice, my lo-Imp.I am the Lord of Har-    renhal and a member of the kings council, who are you to chastise me like this?"
812,Janos,Tyrion,"I think you know quite well who I am.How many sons do you  have?What are my sons to you, dwarf?Dwarf?"
813,Janos,Tyrion,You should have stopped at Imp.
814,Janos,Tyrion,"Now, how many sons do you have?"
815,Janos,Tyrion,"Th-three, mlord."
816,Janos,Tyrion,  
817,Janos,Tyrion,"You have my word, no harm will come to them."
818,Harren,Janos,"Your eldest son will inherit the  title Lord Slynt, and this appalling sigil of yours."
819,Harren,Janos,"Lands will be found for him, and he can build a seat for himself."
820,Harren,Janos,it will be up to him to make a marriage for the girl.
821,Janos,Tyrion,Wh-what .
822,Janos,Tyrion,?
823,Janos,Tyrion,What do I mean to do with you?
824,Janos,Tyrion,The  carrack Summers Dream sails on the morning tide.
825,Janos,Joffrey,"I wish you long life and good service, my lord."
826,Janos,Joffrey,"We will see about this, Imp."
827,Joffrey,Petyr,Perhaps it will be you on the Wall.
828,Joffrey,Petyr,"You and your threats,  well, we will see."
829,Janos,Small,Indeed we will.
830,Janos,Small,"Janos,"
831,Jacelyn,Janos,"Lord Slynt,I believe you know Ser Jacelyn Bywater, our new Commander of the  City Watch.We have a litter waiting for you, my lord,The docks are dark and distant, and  the streets are not safe by night.Men."
832,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Its a long voyage, and Lord Slynt will want for company.See that these  six join him on the Summers Dream."
833,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"As you will.Theres one,Deem.Tell the captain it would not be taken amiss if that one should  happen to be swept overboard before they reach Eastwatch.Im told those northern waters are very stormy, my lord."
834,Tyrion,Varys,"Oh sweetly done, my good  lord.Then why do I have this bitter taste in my mouth?"
835,Tyrion,Varys,"I told them  to throw Allar Deem into the sea.I am sorely tempted to do the same with you.You might be disappointed by the result,The storms come and go, the waves crash  overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling.Might I trouble you for a taste of the wine  that Lord Slynt enjoyed so much?"
836,Tyrion,Varys,Ah.Sweet as summer.
837,Tyrion,Varys,I hear the grapes singing on my  tongue.I wondered what that noise was.
838,Janos,Varys,Cersei sent the gold cloaks to that brothel.
839,Tyrion,Varys,"You left that part out,Your own sweet sister,It is a hard thing to tell a  man, my lord."
840,Cersei,Tyrion,"Can you forgive me?No,Damn you.Damn her."
841,Alla,Allar,"In future, you will tell me what you know, Lord Varys.All of what you  know."
842,Alla,Allar,"That might take rather a long time, my good lord.I know quite a lot.Not enough to save this child, it would seem.Alas, no."
843,Shae,Tyrion,"What threat could she pose?She was Roberts,That was enough for Cersei, it would seem.Yes."
844,Shae,Tyrion,"I must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and her mother, who was so  young and loved the king.Did she?"
845,Shae,Tysha,"Can a whore truly love anyone, I wonder?"
846,Shae,Tysha,Some things I would rather not know.
847,Janos,Tyrion,"You help me most here, between  the sheets,"
848,Ilyn,Janos,It does seem my sister was telling the truth about Starks death.We have my nephew to thank for  that madness.King Joffrey gave the command.
849,Ilyn,Janos,..
850,Ilyn,Tyrion,"A  folly.With the City Watch in hand, my lord, you are well placed to see to it that His Grace commits no  further ."
851,Cersei,Tyrion,.The red cloaks?
852,Cersei,Tyrion,Vylarrs loyalty is to Casterly Rock.
853,Tyrion,Varys,"And six thousand gold cloaks, if Bywater is the man you claim.You will find Ser Jacelyn to be courageous, honorable, obedient ."
854,Tyrion,Varys,"and most grateful.To whom, I wonder?"
855,Tyrion,Varys,"Why are you so helpful, my lord Varys?"
856,Tyrion,Varys,"You are the Hand.I serve the realm, the king, and you.As you served Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark?I served Lord Arryn and Lord Stark as best I could.I was saddened and horrified by their most  untimely deaths.Think how I feel.Im like to be next.Oh, I think not,Power is a curious thing, my lord.Perchance  you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?It has crossed my mind a time or two,The king, the priest, the rich man-who lives  and who dies?"
857,Tyrion,Varys,"All depends on the man with the sword.And yet he is no one,He has neither crown nor gold nor favor of the gods, only a piece of  pointed steel.That piece of steel is the power of life and death.Just so ."
858,Baelor,Varys,"Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his  father? Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords.Then these other swordsmen have the true power."
859,Baelor,Varys,Why do  they obey?
860,Baelor,Varys,Some say knowledge is power.
861,Ilyn,Tyrion,another? 
862,Tyrion,Varys,"Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my  head ache worse?"
863,Tyrion,Varys,"Here, then."
864,Tyrion,Varys,"No more and no less.So power is a mummers trick?A shadow on the wall,yet shadows can kill."
865,Tyrion,Varys,"Lord Varys, I am growing strangely fond of you.I may kill you yet, but I think Id feel  sad about it.I will take that as high praise.What are you, Varys?"
866,Shae,Tyrion,"A spider, they say.Spies and informers are seldom loved, my lord.I am but a loyal servant of the realm.And a eunuch.Let us not forget that.I seldom do.People have called me a halfman too, yet I think the gods have been kinder to me."
867,Tyrion,Varys,"Who are you, truly? "
868,Tyrion,Varys,"You are  kind to ask, my lord, but my tale is long and sad, and we have treasons to discuss."
869,Tyrion,Varys,The master of the Kings Galley White Hart plots to slip anchor  three days hence to offer his sword and ship to Lord Stannis.
870,Tyrion,Varys,"I suppose we must make some sort of bloody lesson out of the man?Ser Jacelyn could arrange for him to vanish, but a trial before the king would help assure the continued  loyalty of the other captains."
871,Tyrion,Varys,As you say.Put him down for a dose of Joffreys  justice.
872,Jacelyn,Varys,"Ser Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne have bribed a guard to let  them out a postern gate, the night after next.Arrangements have been made for them to sail on the  Pentoshi galley Moonrunner, disguised as oarsmen.Can we keep them on those oars for a few years, see how they fancy it?"
873,Jacelyn,Varys,"No, my sister  would be distraught to lose such treasured guests."
874,Jacelyn,Varys,"And have men posted around the  Moonrunner, in case the Redwynes find a second guard short of coin.As you will."
875,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Your man Timett  slew a winesellers son this evening, at a gambling den on the Street of Silver.He accused him of  cheating at tiles.Was it true?Oh, beyond a doubt.Then the honest men of the city owe Timett a debt of gratitude.I shall see that he has the kings thanks."
876,Tyrion,Varys,We also have a sudden plague of holy men.
877,Tyrion,Varys,They  beg in the winesinks and pot-shops and foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen.
878,Tyrion,Varys,"We are close on the three hundredth year since Aegons Landing, I suppose it is only  to be expected.Let them rant.They are spreading fear, my lord.I thought that was your job."
879,Tanda,Varys,You are very cruel to say so.
880,Balon,Tyrion,.
881,Balon,Tyrion,Enough.
882,Balon,Tyrion,"I am not interested in treasonous table talk, Lord  Varys.You are as wise as you are gentle, my lord."
883,Balon,Tyrion,We both  have much to do.I shall leave you.
884,Bronn,Varys,Slynt?
885,Bronn,Varys,Lord Janos will be sailing for the Wall on the morning tide.
886,Joffrey,Timett,"More likely, I have replaced Petyrs man with  one belonging to Varys, but so be it.Youd best know, Timett killed a man-Varys told me."
887,Joffrey,Timett,The fool figured a one-eyed man would be easier to cheat.
888,Bronn,Tyrion,   Tyrion said.
889,Bronn,Tyrion,"And then I give them a chance to kill me, while I do the same for them.Have you killed any?No one we could have used.And if one of them kills you?Hell be one youll want to hire."
890,Bronn,Tyrion,"Tell me, Bronn."
891,Alla,Allar,Without question?Without question?No.
892,Alla,Allar,Id ask how much.
893,Lommy,Yoren,"I never did nothing to no queen,I did my  work, is all."
894,Arya,Lommy,"I was sposed to be an armorer, and one day Master  Mott says I got to join the Nights Watch, thats all I know."
895,Gendry,Lommy,"I bet hes that traitors bastard,The wolf lord, the one they nicked on Baelors steps.He is not,"
896,Arya,Yoren,"Were not far from Gods Eye,The kingsroad wont be safe till  were across the Trident.So well come up around the lake along the western shore, theyre not like to  look for us there."
897,Arya,Joffrey,Theres a hunter  now.
898,Arya,Yoren,"Time was, a man in  black was feasted from Dorne to Winterfell, and even high lords called it an honor to shelter him under  their roofs,Now cravens like you want hard coin for a bite of wormy apple."
899,Arya,Yoren,"Its sweetcorn, bettern a stinking old black bird like you deserves,You get out of our field now, and take these sneaks and stabbers with you, or well stake you up in the  corn to scare the other crows away."
900,Arya,Yoren,"Twenty or thirty men, in mail  and halfhelms,Some of them are cut up bad, and ones dying, from the sound of him."
901,Arya,Yoren,"I think they been there awhile, from the stink of the place.See a banner?Spotted treecat, yellow and black, on a mud-brown field."
902,Arya,Yoren,"Cant say,Might be one side, might  be tother."
903,Arya,Yoren,I believe well go wide around them.
904,Arya,Yoren,Youll have time enough on the Wall.
905,Arya,Yoren,Seems to me theres no rush to get there. 
906,Chett,Yoren,"Him in his tree, lets see how well he likes it up there when the Others come  to take him.Hell scream for the Watch then, that he will."
907,Chett,Yoren,"Either this road went and turned again, or  that suns setting in the north."
908,Chett,Yoren,"Fire,"
909,Chett,Yoren,Wind  should blow it away from us.Still bears watching.
910,Arya,Gendry,Should we go in after them?
911,Arya,Gendry,Yoren said wait.
912,Biter,Rorge,"Please,Please.Please."
913,Hot,Yoren,"And be quick about it,Come  dark, therell be wolves here, and worse.Im scared,Me too,"
914,Arya,Hot,"I never truly kicked no boy to death, Arry.I just sold my mommys pies, is  all.Please."
915,Chett,Jacelyn,
916,Arya,Yoren,Please.
917,Lommy,Yoren,"No fire tonight,"
918,Arya,Hot,Where you going?
919,Arya,Hot,"No youre not,"
920,Arya,Yoren,"The old man said for everyone to stay    close tonight.I need to make water,Well, use that tree right there."
921,Arya,Yoren,"You dont know whats out there, Arry.I heard wolves  before."
922,Hot,Yoren,"Wolves?For true?I heard,I dont think I need to go after all."
923,Arya,Yoren,"Wolves,In the woods.Aye.They would be."
924,Arya,Yoren,They scared me.Did they?
925,Arya,Yoren,Seems to me your kind was fond o wolves.Nymeria was a direwolf.
926,Arya,Yoren,Thats different.
927,Arya,Yoren,"Jory and I threw  rocks at her until she ran off, or  else the queen would have killed her."
928,Arya,Yoren,"I bet if shed been in the city, she  wouldnt have let them cut off Fathers head.Orphan boys got no fathers,or did you forget that?"
929,Arya,Yoren,"The only wolves we got to fear are the ones wear manskin, like  those who done for that village.I wish I was home,"
930,Arya,Yoren,"Might  be I should of left you where I found you, boy."
931,Arya,Yoren,"Safer in the city, seems to me.I dont care.I want to go home.Been bringing men to the Wall for close on thirty years."
932,Chett,Yoren,"All that time, I only lost three.Old man died of a fever, city boy got snakebit taking a shit, and  one fool tried to kill me in my sleep and got a red smile for his trouble."
933,Chett,Yoren,Three in thirty years.
934,Chett,Yoren,"A ship now, might have been  wiser."
935,Chett,Yoren,thirty years I been taking this kingsroad.
936,Chett,Yoren,"Go to sleep, boy.Hear me?"
937,Alla,Allar,"An ill thing,"
938,Alla,Davos,"Silence,Remember where you are."
939,Davos,Selyse,"RhIlor, come to us in our  darkness,Lord of Light, we offer you these false gods, these  seven who are one, and him the enemy.Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and  full of terrors."
940,Melisandre,Stannis,"Their beauty will make them more pleasing to Rhllor,"
941,Davos,Melisandre,In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a  day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world.
942,Melisandre,Stannis,"And that sword shall be Lightbringer,  the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall  flee before him."
943,Davos,Stannis,"Azor Ahai, beloved of  Rhllor!"
944,Davos,Stannis,Come forth and take  it into your hand!
945,Davos,Patchface,"Under the sea, smoke rises in bubbles, and flames burn green and blue and black,I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."
946,Axell,Selyse,A sword of fire!
947,Axell,Melisandre,A sword of fire!
948,Axell,Melisandre,A sword of fire!
949,Axell,Melisandre,"Beholdl A sign was promised, and now a sign is seen!"
950,Melisandre,Stannis,All hail the Son of Fire!
951,Melisandre,Selyse,"Lord, cast your light upon us!"
952,Melisandre,Selyse,"For the night is dark and full of terrors,"
953,Alla,Allar,"Devan acquitted himself well,He fetched the glove without dropping it, yes,"
954,Allar,Allard,"That badge on Devans doublet, the fiery heart, what was that?The Baratheon sigil is a  crowned stag.A lord can choose more than one badge,"
955,Alla,Allar,"A black ship and an onion, Father?"
956,Allar,Allard,The Others take our onion .
957,Allard,Davos,It was an ill thing to burn  the Seven.When did you grow so devout?
958,Davos,Stannis,"What does a smugglers son know of the doings of  gods?Im a knights son, Father.If you wont remember, why should they? A knights son, but not a knight,Nor will you ever be, if you meddle in affairs that do not  concern you."
959,Alla,Allar,"That is all.As to that, Father,"
960,Alla,Allar,"The water will spoil on a voyage of any length.I got the same for Lady Marya,The queens men have laid claim to all the seasoned  wood.I will speak to the king about it,"
961,Davos,Salladhor,"Luck,"
962,Davos,Salladhor,"Ser knight, come sit with me."
963,Davos,Salladhor,They are  marvelously sweet.
964,Davos,Stannis,"You did not see the gods burn, my lord?"
965,Davos,Stannis,The red priests have a great temple on Lys.
966,Davos,Stannis,"Soon they will bore King Stannis too, it is to be hoped."
967,Davos,Salladhor,"My Bird of Thousand Colors came in yesterday, good  ser."
968,Davos,Salladhor,"Children go hungry in the city, it is said."
969,Davos,Salladhor,"Its ale I need, and news.The men of Westeros are ever rushing,What good is this, I ask you?He  who hurries through life hurries to his grave."
970,Davos,Salladhor,The Lord of Casterly Rock has sent his dwarf  to see to Kings Landing.
971,Davos,Salladhor,The dwarf has chased off the lout who ruled the gold cloaks and put in  his place a knight with an iron hand.
972,Davos,Salladhor,How well is the city defended?
973,Chett,Davos,"The walls are high and strong, but who will man them?"
974,Cersei,Davos,"I have been too long away from my wives, and all in his service.Pirate,You have no wives, only concubines, and you have been well paid for every day  and every ship.Only in promises,Good ser, it is gold I crave, not words on papers."
975,Salladhor,Stannis,Youll have your gold when we take the treasury in Kings Landing.
976,Davos,Stannis,He will keep his word.
977,Davos,Tywin,So he has said and said.
978,Davos,Tywin,"Even these grapes could be no more ripe  than that city, my old friend."
979,Davos,Tywin,"Might be we could take Kings  Landing, as you say,"
980,Renly,Salladhor,".Ah, yes, the young brother,That part is not so good, my friend."
981,Renly,Salladhor,He marches up your road of roses toward the very same great city we  were speaking of.He takes his bride?
982,Renly,Salladhor,He did not tell me why.
983,Davos,Renly,"Or perhaps he is that certain of his victory.The king must be told.I have attended to it, good ser."
984,Chett,Davos,"That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend."
985,Chett,Davos,"Sword?A sword plucked from fire, yes."
986,Chett,Davos,"How shall a burnt sword  serve Stannis?A buming sword,Burnt,"
987,Chett,Jacelyn,"Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he  began."
988,Chett,Hero,"A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the  sacred fires, he summoned his wife."
989,Hero,Salladhor,Now do you see my meaning?
990,Hero,Salladhor,"Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire bums."
991,Davos,Salladhor,"When do you think the king will bid us sail, good ser? Soon, I think,if his god wills it.His god, ser friend?"
992,Davos,Salladhor,"Where is the god of Ser Davos Seaworth, knight of the onion ship?"
993,Davos,Salladhor,King Stannis is my god.He made me and blessed me  with his trust.I will remember.
994,Davos,Salladhor,My pardons.
995,Davos,Stannis,"Well, if  he grants me Queen Cersei for a night I shall forgive him."
996,Beth,Devan,Luck.
997,Beth,Devan,"My lord  father,His Grace commands you to attend him in the Chamber of the Painted Table."
998,Davos,Robert,"Ser Davos, it is good to see you, as ever,And you, my lord.I made note of you this morning as well.The false gods burned with a merry light, did they not?They burned brightly."
999,Davos,Renly,The Lady Melisandre tells us that sometimes Rhllor permits his faithful servants to glimpse the future in  flames.
1000,Davos,Stannis,A  glimpse of the glory that awaits His Grace after we take Kings Landing and the throne that is his by  rights.
1001,Axell,Davos,"I saw  only fire,but the smoke was making my eyes water."
1002,Davos,Pylos,"Ser,come have a look at this letter."
1003,Davos,Pylos,"It looks handsome enough, Your Grace, but I fear I cannot  read the words."
1004,Stannis,Steffon,Id forgotten.
1005,Stannis,Steffon,"Pylos, read it to him.Your Grace."
1006,Robert,Stannis,"All men know me for  the trueborn son of Steffon Baratheon,    Lord of Storms End, by his lady wife Cassana of House Estermont."
1007,Pylos,Stannis,"Done in the Light of the Lord,  under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the  Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. "
1008,Pylos,Stannis,"Make it Ser Jaime the Kingslayer henceforth,Whatever else the man may be,  he remains a knight."
1009,Pylos,Robert,"He loved me  no more than he had to, nor I him.A harmless courtesy, Your Grace,A lie.Take it out."
1010,Davos,Stannis,The maester tells me that we have one hundred seventeen  ravens on hand.
1011,Robb,Stannis,"So I have need of you.I am yours to command, my king.As ever."
1012,Robb,Stannis,"I mean for you to sail Black Betha north, to Gulltown, the Fingers, the Three Sisters,  even White Harbor."
1013,Davos,Pylos,"Nail them to the doors of septs and inns for every man  to read who can.That will be few enough.Ser Davos speaks truly, Your Grace,It would be better to have the letters read  aloud.Better, but more dangerous,These words will not be kindly received.Give me knights to do the reading,That will carry more weight than anything I might say."
1014,Davos,Stannis,"I can give you such men, yes."
1015,Davos,Pylos,"The world  will know of my claim, and of Cerseis infamy."
1016,Davos,Pylos,"Maester, perhaps you ought get to your writing.We will need a great many letters,  and soon.As you will."
1017,Pylos,Stannis,"What is it you would not say in the presence of my  maester, Davos?My liege, Pylos is pleasant enough, but I cannot see the chain about his neck without mourning for  Maester Cressen.Is it his fault the old man died?"
1018,Pylos,Stannis,I never wanted Cressen at that feast.
1019,Pylos,Stannis,he ground his teeth together-And Pylos serves me ably.Pylos is the least of it.
1020,Pylos,Stannis,"What did your lords make of it, I wonder?"
1021,Robert,Stannis,Celtigar pronounced it admirable.
1022,Edric,Robert,"The Others take my lords, Ill hear your views.Your words were blunt and strong.And true.And true."
1023,Edric,Robert,No more than you did a year ago.Theres proof of a sort at Storms End.
1024,Stannis,Tommen,"Yet how are men to see him, if he is at Storms End?"
1025,Stannis,Tommen,It is a difficulty.One of many.
1026,Davos,Stannis,You have more to say about the  letter.
1027,Davos,Stannis,"Say what you would say, Davos."
1028,Davos,Stannis,There was a phrase at the end.
1029,Davos,Stannis,.Yes.
1030,Davos,Stannis,Your people will mislike those words.As you did?
1031,Davos,Stannis,"If you were to say instead, Done in the sight of gods and men, or By the grace of the gods old and new  ."
1032,Davos,Stannis,".Have you gone devout on me, smuggler?That was to be my question for you, my liege.Was it now?It sounds as though you love my new god no more than you love my new maester.I do not know this Lord of Light,but I knew the gods we burned this morning."
1033,Davos,Stannis,"It was wood we burned this morning.That may be so,but when I was a boy in Flea Bottom begging for a copper, sometimes  the septons would feed me.I feed you now.You have given me an honored place at your table."
1034,Davos,Stannis,"Your people will not  love you if you take from them the gods they have always worshiped, and give them one whose very  name sounds queer on their tongues."
1035,Davos,Stannis,Rhllor.
1036,Davos,Stannis,How can I lose something I have never owned?
1037,Davos,Stannis,I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the  bay.
1038,Chett,Stannis,"In Kings Landing, the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the  Seven, but all I ever saw of either was made by men.If you do not believe in gods--why trouble with this new one?"
1039,Chett,Stannis,"I have asked myself as well.I know little and care  less of gods, but the red priestess has power."
1040,Chett,Stannis,"Cressen had wisdom.I trusted in his wisdom and your wiles, and what did they avail me, smuggler?"
1041,Robert,Stannis,When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health.
1042,Davos,Stannis,"I was making a fool of myself  with Proudwing, he said, and he was right."
1043,Davos,Stannis,The Seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow.
1044,Davos,Stannis,A red hawk.
1045,Robb,Theon,"Does the castle look as you remember it, milord?"
1046,Robb,Theon,"It looks smaller,though perhaps that is only the distance."
1047,Chett,Theon,"It must be windy there,"
1048,Chett,Theon,Windy and cold and damp.
1049,Chett,Theon,"but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men, and hard men rule the  world.May we  make for port now, milord?You may,"
1050,Chett,Theon,"The Drowned God makes men,but its men who make crowns."
1051,Chett,Theon,"Summon me when we make Lordsport,Well be below, in  my cabin."
1052,Dagmer,Theon,"You must be so happy to see your home again,  milord. he told her."
1053,Chett,Theon,Take off your cloak.
1054,Chett,Theon,"Come here,"
1055,Chett,Theon,I have never seen the Iron Islands.Count yourself fortunate.
1056,Chett,Theon,"The islands are stern and stony places, scant of comfort and bleak of prospect."
1057,Chett,Theon,Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding.
1058,Chett,Theon,"I could go ashore with you,I would, if it please  you ."
1059,Chett,Theon,".You could go ashore,but not with me, I fear.Id work in your castle, milord."
1060,Chett,Theon,You could find me a place in your kitchens and I could  make you peppercrab stew.And warm my bed by night?
1061,Chett,Theon,"Once I might have carried you home as a prize, and kept you to wife whether  you willed it or no."
1062,Chett,Theon,"A man had his rock wife, his true bride, ironborn  like himself, but he had his salt wives too, women captured on raids."
1063,Chett,Theon,"I would be your salt wife,  milord.I fear those days are gone."
1064,Chett,Theon,"No longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword, taking what we want.Now we scratch in  the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men, and count ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and  porridge enough to get us through a winter."
1065,Chett,Theon,"You can put it in me again, if it please you,"
1066,Chett,Theon,It    would please me to teach you something new.Unlace me and pleasure me with your mouth.With my mouth?
1067,Chett,Theon,"Its what those lips were made for, sweetling.If you were  my salt wife, youd do as I command."
1068,Balon,Theon,"Did I please  milord? Well enough,It tasted salty,Like the sea?"
1069,Balon,Theon,"I have always loved the sea, milord.As I have,"
1070,Chett,Theon,"Take me with you, milord,I dont need to go to your castle.I can stay    in some town, and be your salt wife."
1071,Chett,Theon,"My place is Pyke, and yours is on this  ship.I cant stay here now."
1072,Chett,Theon,"Why not?My father,Once youre gone, hell punish me, milord.Hell call me names and hit me."
1073,Chett,Theon,"Fathers are like that,Tell him he should be pleased."
1074,Robert,Theon,Its not every man who has the honor of raising a kings bastard.
1075,Chett,Theon,"Were out of Oldtown,bearing apples and oranges,  wines from the Arbor, feathers from the Summer Isles."
1076,Chett,Theon,And Ive brought your heir back to you.
1077,Chett,Theon,Have your men  bring my things.
1078,Chett,Theon,"Innkeeper,I  require a horse.As you say, mlord,"
1079,Chett,Theon,"Happens as I have one might do.Where would you be riding, mlord?Pyke."
1080,Chett,Theon,"Youll want to be off soon, to reach Pyke afore dark,My boy will go with you and  show you the way.Your boy will not be needed,nor your horse."
1081,Balon,Theon,Damphair.
1082,Balon,Theon,Uncle Aeron?
1083,Balon,Theon,"Nephew Theon,Your lord father bid me fetch you.Come.In a moment, Uncle."
1084,Balon,Theon,"My things,"
1085,Balon,Theon,Milord.
1086,Aeron,Theon,"You have my thanks.Please,I do love you well, milord.I must go."
1087,Aeron,Theon,"I had not looked for you, Uncle.After ten years, I thought perhaps my lord father  and lady mother might come themselves, or send Dagmer with an honor guard.It is not for you to question the commands of the Lord Reaper of Pyke."
1088,Aeron,Theon,"As to Dagmer, the Cleftiaw is gone to Old Wyk at your fathers behest, to  roust the Stonehouses and the Drumms.To what purpose?Why are the longships hosting?Why have longships ever hosted?"
1089,Aeron,Theon,"Tell me true, nephew.Do you pray to the wolf gods  now?"
1090,Aeron,Theon,"Eddard Stark prayed to a tree.No, I care nothing for Starks gods.Good.Kneel."
1091,Aeron,Theon,"Uncle, I-Kneel."
1092,Aeron,Theon,Bow your head.
1093,Aeron,Theon,"Let Theon your servant be born again from the sea, as you were,Bless  him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.Nephew, do you still know the words?What is dead may never die,What is dead may never die,but rises again, harder and stronger."
1094,Aeron,Theon,"I have been half my life away from home,Will I find the islands changed?Men fish the sea, dig in the earth, and die."
1095,Asha,Theon,The islands are as our god made them.
1096,Asha,Theon,Will I find my sister and my lady mother at Pyke?You will not.
1097,Asha,Theon,"She will return eer long, you may be sure."
1098,Robb,Theon,"Stark is grey and Greyjoys black,but it seems were both windy."
1099,Robb,Theon,"And what of you, Uncle?"
1100,Robb,Theon,"You were no priest when I was taken from Pyke.I remember  how you would sing the old reaving songs standing on the table with a horn of ale in hand.Young I was, and vain,"
1101,Aeron,Theon,"When I  rose again, I saw clearly."
1102,Aeron,Theon,"Uncle,  why has my father called his swords and sails?Doubtless he will tell you at Pyke.I would know his plans now.From me, you shall not.We are commanded not to speak of this to any man.Even to me?"
1103,Asha,Theon,"If  my father makes plans for war, I must know of them.I am not any man, I am heir to Pyke and the Iron  Islands.As to that,we shall see."
1104,Asha,Theon,We shall see~ My brothers are both dead.I am my lord fathers    only living son.Your sister lives.
1105,Asha,Theon,"A woman may inherit  only if there is no male heir in the direct line,I will not be cheated of my rights, I warn  you."
1106,Asha,Theon,"You warn a servant of the Drowned God, boy?"
1107,Eddard,Theon,The ride is long enough without your magpie chatterings.
1108,Patrek,Theon,"Never mind that the bell has been rung just once in three hundred years,When my brother stormed Seagard,"
1109,Patrek,Rodrik,"If your father supposes I bear him some enmity  for that, its only because he never knew Rodrik."
1110,Aeron,Theon,"Robb Stark is Lord of Winterfell now,"
1111,Aeron,Theon,"One wolf is much like the other.Robb has broken fealty with the Iron Throne and crowned himself King in the North.Theres war.The maesters ravens fly over salt as soon as rock.This news is old and cold.It means a new day, Uncle.Every morning brings a new day, much like the old.In Riverrun, they would tell you different."
1112,Aeron,Theon,"A messenger  from the gods.A sign it is,"
1113,Aeron,Theon,"It is  time to hoist our sails and go forth into the world with fire and sword, as he did."
1114,Aeron,Theon,I could not agree more.A man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm.
1115,Aeron,Theon,"Will you not stay the night and share our meat and mead, Uncle?Bring you, I was told."
1116,Aeron,Theon,Now I return to our gods business.
1117,Eddard,Theon,"Mlord, I am sent to show you  to chambers.By whose bidding?Your lord father, mlord."
1118,Eddard,Theon,"So you do know who I am.Why is my father not here to greet me?He awaits you in the Sea Tower, mlord.When you are rested from your trip."
1119,Eddard,Theon,"And who are you?Helya, who keeps this castle for your lord father.Sylas was steward here.They called him Sourmouth."
1120,Eddard,Theon,"Dead these five years, mlord.And what of Maester Qalen, where is he?He sleeps in the sea.Wendamyr keeps the ravens now."
1121,Eddard,Theon,"Show me to my chambers, woman,"
1122,Chett,Theon,"Ill have a basin of hot water and a fire in this hearth,See that they  light braziers in the other rooms to drive out some of the chill.And gods be good, get someone in here at  once to change these rushes.Yes, mlord.As you command."
1123,Chett,Theon,"When I return, I shall expect a warm room and clean rushes,"
1124,Balon,Theon,"You are the son?Out of my way, or youll learn who I am."
1125,Balon,Theon,"Nine years, is it?"
1126,Balon,Theon,"Ten,A boy they took,What are you now?A man,Your blood and your heir."
1127,Balon,Theon,"We shall see.You shall,Ten years, you say."
1128,Balon,Theon,"And now you come as his envoy.Not his,Lord Eddard is dead, beheaded by the Lannister queen.They are both dead, Stark and that Robert who broke my walls with his stones.I vowed Id live to see  them both in their graves, and I have."
1129,Balon,Theon,"Yet the cold and the damp still make my joints  ache, as when they were alive.So what does it serve?It serves."
1130,Balon,Theon,I bring a letter-Did Eddard Stark dress you like that?
1131,Balon,Theon,Was it  his pleasure to garb you in velvets and silks and make you his own sweet daughter?
1132,Balon,Theon,"I am no mans daughter.If you mislike my garb, I will change it.You will."
1133,Balon,Theon,That bauble around your neck-was it bought with gold or iron?
1134,Balon,Theon,"You blush red as a maid, Theon."
1135,Balon,Theon,"Is it the gold price you paid, or the iron?The gold,"
1136,Balon,Theon,"My daughter has taken an axe for a lover,I will  not have my son bedeck himself like a whore."
1137,Balon,Theon,"It is as I feared.The green lands have made you  soft, and the Starks have made you theirs. Youre wrong.Eddard Stark was my gaoler, but my blood is still salt and iron."
1138,Balon,Theon,"Yet the Stark pup sends you to me  like a well-trained raven, clutching his little message.There is nothing small about the letter I bear,and the offer he makes is one I suggested to  him.This wolf king heeds your counsel, does he?"
1139,Balon,Eddard,"He heeds me, yes."
1140,Eddard,Rodrik,  
1141,Eddard,Rodrik,"Not here, not in Pyke, not in my hearing, you will not name  him brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.Or have you forgotten Rodrik  and Maron, who were your own blood?I forget nothing."
1142,Rodrik,Theon,"I remember my  brothers very well,"
1143,Robb,Rodrik,I remember when my father was a king too.
1144,Balon,Robb,Here.
1145,Balon,Robb,Your Grace.
1146,Theon,Tywin,"So the  boy would give me a crown again,and all I need do is destroy his enemies."
1147,Theon,Tywin,"By now Robb is at the Golden Tooth,Once it falls, hell be through the hills in a day."
1148,Balon,Theon,"If the gods are with us, even Casterly Rock itself may fall before the  Lannisters so much as realize that we are upon them."
1149,Balon,Theon,Casterly Rock has never fallen.Until now.
1150,Balon,Theon,"So this is why Robb Stark sends  you back to me, after so long?So you might win my consent to th-is-pl-anof his? It is my plan, not Robbs,"
1151,Balon,Theon,"I will lead the attack myself, if it please you.As my reward I would ask that you grant me Casterly Rock  for my own seat, once we have taken it from the Lannisters."
1152,Balon,Theon,You reward yourself handsomely for a notion and a few lines of scribbling.
1153,Balon,Theon,"The pup says nothing about a reward.Only that you speak for him, and I am to listen, and give  him my sails and swords, and in return he will give me a crown."
1154,Balon,Theon,"He will give me a crown,A poor choice of words, what is meant is-"
1155,Balon,Theon,And what is given can be taken away.
1156,Robb,Theon,Have you gone mad?
1157,Robb,Theon,Mind your tongue.
1158,Balon,Theon,"I will  take my crown, as Urron Redhand did five thousand years ago."
1159,Balon,Theon,"Take it, then,Call yourself King of the Iron islands, no one will care ."
1160,Balon,Theon,"until the wars are over, and  the victor looks about and spies the old fool perched off his shore with an iron crown on his head."
1161,Balon,Theon,"Well, at the least you are no craven."
1162,Theon,Tywin,"not so juicy sweet, to be sure, yet it hangs there ripe and undefended."
1163,Daenerys,Doreah,"That way lies the red lands,  Khaleesi.A grim place and terrible, the riders say.The way the comet points is the way we must go,"
1164,Daenerys,Jorah,Why should I fear Pono?
1165,Daenerys,Jorah,"He  was Drogos ko, and always spoke me gently.Ko Pono spoke you gently,Khal Pono will  kill you."
1166,Daenerys,Drogo,You have a  hundred.
1167,Daenerys,Jorah,"I have the dragons,Hatchlings,One swipe from an arakh would put an end to them, though Porto is more  like to seize them for himself."
1168,Jorah,Mirri,"Every man who sees them will want them, my queen.They are mine,"
1169,Daenerys,Mirri,No man will take them from me  while I live.You will not live long should you meet Khal Pono.
1170,Daenerys,Mirri,You must go  where they do not.
1171,Daenerys,Jorah,"We follow the comet,"
1172,Daenerys,Irri,"His time was past,No man should live longer than his teeth."
1173,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Aegons dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria,Visenyas dragon was Vhagar, Rhaenys had Meraxes, and Aegon rode Balerion,  the Black Dread."
1174,Daenerys,Viserys,"his fire was as black as his  scales, his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed  overhead."
1175,Jorah,Viserys,"Khaleesi,there sits  Balerion, come again.It may be as you say, blood of my blood,"
1176,Jorah,Viserys,His dragon will do what he could not.And the black beast?
1177,Jorah,Viserys,"The black,is Drogon."
1178,Daenerys,Jorah,Are we lost?
1179,Daenerys,Jorah,"Does this waste have no end to it?It has an end,I have seen the maps the traders draw, my queen."
1180,Drogo,Jorah,.Will we live to see them?I will not lie to you.The way is harder than I dared think.
1181,Daenerys,Drogo,Perhaps we are doomed if we press on .
1182,Daenerys,Drogo,but I know for a certainty that we are doomed if we  turn back.
1183,Aggo,Daenerys,"A city,  Khaleesi,A city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid.An hours ride, no more.Show me,"
1184,Aggo,Daenerys,Do you know what place this might be?Ser Jorah.
1185,Aggo,Daenerys,"No, my queen.I have never traveled this far east."
1186,Aggo,Rakharo,"Blood of my blood, go  ahead of us and learn the name of this city, and what manner of welcome we should expect.Ai, Khaleesi, "
1187,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"This city  is dead, Khaleesi.Nameless and godless we found it, the gates broken, only wind and flies moving  through the streets."
1188,Irri,Jhiqui,"When the gods are gone, the evil ghosts feast by night."
1189,Daenerys,Irri,"It is known.It is known,Not to me."
1190,Daenerys,Irri,"Ghosts,Terrible ghosts.We  must not stay here, Khaleesi, this is their place.I fear no ghosts.Dragons are more powerful than ghosts."
1191,Daenerys,Irri,"Go with Jhiqui  and find me some clean sand for a bath, and trouble me no more with silly talk."
1192,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Your hair is coming back, Khaleesi,"
1193,Daenerys,Jorah,"Send him  in,"
1194,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ive brought you a peach,"
1195,Daenerys,Jorah,"Fruit and water and shade,The gods were good to  bring us to this place.We should rest here until we are stronger,The red lands are not kind to the weak.My handmaids say there are ghosts here.There are ghosts everywhere,We carry them with us wherever we go."
1196,Drogo,Viserys,"Tell me the name of  your ghost, Jorah.You know all of mine."
1197,Daenerys,Drogo,Her name was Lynesse.Your wife?My second wife.
1198,Daenerys,Jorah,Is that all you would say of  her?
1199,Daenerys,Jorah,Was she beautiful?Very beautiful.
1200,Daenerys,Jorah,"The first time I beheld her, I  thought she was a goddess come to earth, the Maid herself made flesh."
1201,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Hightowers are an ancient family, very rich and very  proud.And loyal,I remember, Viserys said the Hightowers were among those who stayed true to  my father.Thats so,Did your fathers make the match?No,Our marriage ."
1202,Daenerys,Jorah,"I would not trouble  you with it.I have nowhere to go,Please.As my queen commands."
1203,Daenerys,Jorah,My home .
1204,Chett,Daenerys,"Still, the island suited me well enough, and I never lacked for women."
1205,Daenerys,Jorah,She died not long after.
1206,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am sorry for you, truly."
1207,Daenerys,Jorah,"By then my father had taken the black, so I was Lord of Bear Island in my own  right."
1208,Balon,Robert,"To celebrate his victory, Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside Lannisport."
1209,Jason,Yohn,"I fight as well as any man, Khaleesi, but I have never been a tourney knight."
1210,Daenerys,Drogo,"We were married there in Lannisport, and for a fortnight I was the happiest man in the wide world.Only a fortnight?"
1211,Daenerys,Drogo,A fortnight was how long it took us to sail from Lannisport back to Bear island.
1212,Chett,Drogo,"I lived for her smiles, so I sent all the way to Oldtown for a new cook, and brought a harper from  Lannisport."
1213,Daenerys,Eddard,The rest .
1214,Daenerys,Eddard,"We fled to Lys, where I sold my ship for gold to keep us."
1215,Daenerys,Jorah,Did she die there?
1216,Daenerys,Jorah,"Only to me,In half a year my gold was gone, and I was obliged to take service as a  sellsword."
1217,Daenerys,Jorah,"They say she is his chief concubine now, and even his wife goes in fear of  her."
1218,Daenerys,Jorah,"Do you hate her?Almost as much as I love her,Pray excuse me, my queen.I find I am very tired."
1219,Daenerys,Jorah,"What did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?"
1220,Daenerys,Jorah,"Why, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys."
1221,Daenerys,Jorah,"Sleep well, my  queen."
1222,Aggo,Drogo,"Blood of my blood,"
1223,Jhogo,Rakharo,"Jhogo, you are to follow shierak qiya on southeast.What shall we seek, Khaleesi?"
1224,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Whatever there is,Seek for other cities, living and dead."
1225,Daenerys,Jhogo,"I will know  where I am bound, and how best to get there."
1226,Daenerys,Jhogo,"If so, we must be ready,"
1227,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Blood of my  blood,I have been to the great city Qarth, and returned with three who would look on  you with their own eyes."
1228,Daenerys,Jhogo,Here I stand.
1229,Daenerys,Jhogo,"but first tell me your  names.I am Pyat Pree, the great warlock.I am Xaro Xhoan  Daxos of the Thirteen, a merchant prince of Qarth.I am  Quaithe of the Shadow. Daenerys Targaryen told them."
1230,Jon,Thoren,An old tree.
1231,Jon,Thoren,"Old, Old, old,  old. And powerful."
1232,Small,Thoren,Look at that face.
1233,Jon,Small,Id like to take an axe to the bloody thing  myself.My lord father believed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree. said the Old Bear.
1234,Chett,Jon,The wildlings burn their dead.
1235,Chett,Jon,"Now I wished Id asked them why,  when there were still a few around to ask."
1236,Eddison,Jon,"Would that bones could talk,This fellow could tell us much."
1237,Eddison,Jon,Where the wildlings have gone.
1238,Eddison,Jon,"The children of the forest could  speak to the dead, its said.But I cant."
1239,Eddison,Jon,Go through all these houses.
1240,Eddison,Jon,Perchance this time the trail will be fresher.
1241,Eddison,Jon,"Bad enough when the dead come walking,"
1242,Eddison,Jon,.
1243,Chett,Jon,"What a dismal place to live,I was born in a house much like this,Those were my enchanted years.Later  I fell on hard times."
1244,Chett,Jon,"Id give all the gold in Casterly Rock to sleep in a bed again.You call that a bed?If its softer than the ground and has a roof over it, I call it a bed."
1245,Chett,Jon,I smell  dung.
1246,Chett,Jon,"Old dung,"
1247,Chett,Jon,Theres nothing here.
1248,Chett,Jon,What do you think happened to them all?
1249,Chett,Jon,"Something worse than we can imagine,Well, I might be able to imagine it,  but Id sooner not.Bad enough to know youre going to come to some awful end without thinking about  it aforetime."
1250,Small,Thoren,"Gone,Gone, gone, gone. There were wildlings at Whitetree only a year ago."
1251,Jaremy,Jarman,"A year ago Robert was king, and the realm was at peace,Much can change in a years time.One thing hasnt changed,Fewer wildlings means fewer worries."
1252,Jarman,Jon,"Raiders and murderers, the lot of them."
1253,Petyr,Varys,
1254,Jon,Small,"Nothing else to see, my lords.We might camp here tonight,"
1255,Jon,Small,"No,Giant, how much daylight remains to us?Three hours, my lord.Well press on north,If we reach this lake, we can make camp by the shore,  perchance catch a few fish.Jon, fetch me paper, its past time I wrote Maester Aemon."
1256,Jon,Small,"Find Tarly and see  that he gets this on its way,"
1257,Jarman,Jon,"Corn,"
1258,Ottyn,Small,rangers roads
1259,Jon,Samwell,"Have you been teaching them to talk?A few words.Three of them can say snowOne bird croaking my name was bad enough,and snows nothing a black brother wants to  hear about."
1260,Jon,Samwell,"Was there anything in Whitetree?Bones, ashes, and empty houses."
1261,Jon,Samwell,"The Old Bear wants word  sent back to Aemon.Fly home  now, brave one."
1262,Jon,Samwell,"I wish he could carry me with him.Still?Well,"
1263,Jon,Samwell,dawn came after all.
1264,Jon,Samwell,"I may be craven, but Im not stupid."
1265,Jon,Samwell,Look.
1266,Jon,Samwell,Ive been working on my maps.
1267,Jon,Samwell,"Well make a ranger of you yet,Next thing, youll want to be an outrider like Grenn.Shall I speak to the Old Bear?Dont you dare!"
1268,Jon,Samwell,"I had hoped we might stay the night in the village,It  would be nice to sleep under a roof again.Too few roofs for all of us."
1269,Dywen,Jon,"Were a large  party,The games probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the  march.Frightened away by something, no doubt,"
1270,Dywen,Jon,Is the bird away?
1271,Dywen,Jon,"Yes, my lord.Samwellis teaching them to talk."
1272,Jon,Qhorin,"Hell regret that.Damned things make a lot of noise, but they never say a thing  worth hearing.If my uncle found all these villages empty as well- Lord Mormont finished for him, "
1273,Jon,Qhorin,"We will find them, Jon, I promise  you."
1274,Arya,Lommy,"There, in the reeds."
1275,Lommy,Yoren,"I told you there was bodies,I could taste them in that water."
1276,Lommy,Yoren,"Dobber, see if hes got anything worth the taking.Mail, knife, a  bit o coin, what have you."
1277,Woth,Yoren,We wont be crossing here.
1278,Lommy,Woth,Put a guard out.
1279,Chett,Jacelyn,Mud Pie!
1280,Woth,Yoren,"Might be we could swim the horses  over, maybe the donkeys, but theres no way well get those wagons across.And theres smoke to the  north and west, more fires, could be this side o the rivers the place we want to be."
1281,Woth,Yoren,"Thats Gods Eye, with the river flowing  south.Were here."
1282,Woth,Yoren,"We cant go round  west of the lake, like I thought.East takes us back to the kingsroad."
1283,Hot,Yoren,"Near as I recall, theres a town here."
1284,Arya,Hot,"Theyll have boats, so I mean to sell all we got and hire us one."
1285,Arya,Hot,"Gods be good, well find a wind  and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown."
1286,Arya,Hot,"We can  buy new mounts there, or else take shelter at Harrenhal.Thats Lady Whents seat, and shes always  been a friend o the Watch."
1287,Arya,Hot,Theres ghosts in Harrenhal  Yoren spat.Theres for your ghosts.
1288,Arya,Nan,Mount up.
1289,Chett,Yoren,"Dead, might be."
1290,Chett,Yoren,"Dobber, Rey, with me."
1291,Chett,Yoren,"Pots is gone, no sign o any coin laid by,No animals."
1292,Chett,Yoren,Might be we met em on the kingsroad. 
1293,Arya,Yoren,"Dont like it,"
1294,Arya,Yoren,"Might be they left a boat behind,  or some weapons we can use."
1295,Arya,Gendry,"Keep your eyes and ears open,"
1296,Arya,Lommy,"Theyre gone,"
1297,Arya,Lommy,"Theres an inn,Do you think they left any food?Or ale?Lets go see,Never you mind about no inn,Yoren said were to find a boat.They took the boats."
1298,Arya,Yoren,"Towers empty,Lords gone off to fight maybe, or to get his smallfolk to safety, no telling."
1299,Arya,Yoren,"Saw a goose running loose, and some chickens, and theres good fish in the Gods Eye.The boats are gone,We could patch the bottom of that rowboat,Might do for four o us,Theres nails,And theres trees all around.We could build us all boats."
1300,Lommy,Yoren,"You know anything bout boat-building, dyers boy?"
1301,Gendry,Lommy,"A raft,Anyone can build a raft, and long poles for pushing."
1302,Gendry,Yoren,"Lakes too deep to pole across, but if we stayed to the shallows near shore ."
1303,Arya,Lommy,Ill sleep on it.Can we stay at the inn?
1304,Arya,Lommy,"Well stay in the holdfast, with the gates barred,I like the feel o stone walls about  me when I sleep."
1305,Arya,Lommy,"We shouldnt stay here,The people didnt.They all ran off,  even their lord.Arrys scared,Im not,but they were.Smart boy,Thing is, the folks who lived here were at war, like it or no."
1306,Lommy,Yoren,"Nights  Watch takes no part, so no mans our enemy."
1307,Arya,Gendry,Why cant I split the wood?
1308,Arya,Hot,Whered you get a good sword like  that?
1309,Arya,Hot,"I never said you  stole it, I just wanted to know where you got it, is all.My brother gave it to me,I never knew you had no brother."
1310,Hot,Yoren,"I have lots of brothers.You do?Are they bigger than you, or littler?"
1311,Hot,Yoren,"Bigger,They have  swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who bother me.I was talking, not bothering."
1312,Arya,Hot,"Hot Pie, wake up."
1313,Arya,Hot,"Woth, Gendry, didnt you hear?"
1314,Gendry,Hot,Whats wrong?
1315,Gendry,Hot,Hear what?
1316,Gendry,Hot,"Arry had a bad dream,No, I heard it,A wolf.Arry has wolves in his head,Let them howl,theyre out there, were in  here."
1317,Hot,Woth,"Never saw no wolf could storm a holdfast.I never heard  nothing.It was a wolf,Somethings wrong, someones  coming, get up!"
1318,Biter,Jaqen,Boy!
1319,Arya,Jaqen,Boy!
1320,Arya,Gendry,How many?
1321,Arya,Gendry,"A  hundred,Two hundred, I dont know."
1322,Arya,Gendry,"Theyll come for us soon.There,"
1323,Woth,Yoren,Get  away!
1324,Woth,Yoren,"What are you doing up here?Run and hide someplace, you stupid."
1325,Woth,Yoren,You in the holdfast!
1326,Woth,Yoren,"Open, in the name of the king!Aye, and which king is that?"
1327,Woth,Yoren,You men  hold down here!
1328,Woth,Yoren,"The townfolks gone.And who are you, old man?One of Lord Berics cravens?"
1329,Arya,Yoren,"if that  fat fool Thoros is in there, ask him how he likes these fires.Got no such man here,Only some lads for the  Watch.Got no part o your war."
1330,Arya,Yoren,"Have a look.Thats black, for the Nights Watch.Or black for House Dondarrion, "
1331,Arya,Sansa,Lord Berics sigil is a  purple lightning bolt on a black field.
1332,Arya,Yoren,"Are you blind, man?"
1333,Arya,Yoren,"You see a bloody  lightning bolt?By night all banners look black,Open, or well know you for  outlaws in league with the kings enemies."
1334,Arya,Yoren,Whos got your command?I do.
1335,Arya,Yoren,"Ser  Amory Lorch, bannerman to Lord Tywin Larmister of Casterly Rock, the Hand of the King.The true  king, Joffrey."
1336,Arya,Yoren,"In his name, I command you to open these gates."
1337,Arya,Yoren,Dont see the need.
1338,Arya,Yoren,Were no foes to you.
1339,Arya,Gendry,Cant they see were no lords or  knights?
1340,Amory,Gendry,"I dont think they care, Arry,"
1341,Amory,Yoren,"If you are no traitors, open your gates,Well make certain youre telling it true and  be on our way."
1342,Amory,Yoren,"Told you, no one here but us.You got my word on that."
1343,Amory,Yoren,"The crow gives us his word.You lost, old man?"
1344,Amory,Yoren,"The Walls a long way north o here.I command you once more, in King Joffreys name, to prove the loyalty you profess and open these  gates,"
1345,Amory,Yoren,"Dont think I will.So be it.You defy the kings command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks or no.Got me young boys in here,Young boys and old men die the same."
1346,Amory,Arya,"Storm the walls and kill them all,"
1347,Hot,Yoren,Blades!
1348,Hot,Yoren,"Spread apart, defend the wall wherever they hit."
1349,Hot,Yoren,"Lommy, pull that spear out of Woth and get up where he was."
1350,Arya,Hot,"I dont know how to swordfight,Its easy,"
1351,Arya,Hot,Winterfell!
1352,Arya,Hot,Behind!
1353,Amory,Hot,"Watch them, not me!"
1354,Chett,Jacelyn,Winterfefl!while Hot Pie screamed 
1355,Arya,Yoren,Boy!
1356,Arya,Yoren,"Get out, its done, weve lost."
1357,Arya,Gendry,Now!How?
1358,Arya,Gendry,"That trap,Under the barn."
1359,Arya,Gendry,"He said go,the barn, the way out."
1360,Arya,Hot,"Arry, come on!Lommys  gone, leave her if she wont come!"
1361,Gendry,Hot,Run!
1362,Jaqen,Rorge,Boy!
1363,Jaqen,Rorge,Sweet  boy!
1364,Arya,Gendry,"Tunnels narrow,How do we get her through?Pull her,Push her.Good boys, kind boys,Get these fucking chains off!"
1365,Gendry,Rorge,"You go first, then her, then me.Hurry, its a long way.When you split the firewood,where did you leave the axe?Out by the haven."
1366,Gendry,Rorge,Id save the donkeys first.Theres no  time.You take her!
1367,Gendry,Rorge,You get her out!You do it!
1368,Tyrion,Varys,"Treason is vile enough,but this  is barefaced naked villainy, and I do not need that mincing eunuch to tell me what must be done with  villains."
1369,Petyr,Pycelle,"Maester Frenken received the first missive at Castle Stokeworth,The second copy came through Lord Gyles."
1370,Cersei,Petyr,"If Stannis bothered with them, its past certain every other lord in the  Seven Kingdoms saw a copy as well.I want these letters burned, every one,No hint of this must reach my sons ears, or  my fathers.I imagine Fathers heard rather more than a hint by now,Doubtless Stannis sent a  bird to Casterly Rock, and another to Harrenhal."
1371,Cersei,Tyrion,"And this is not as dire as it seems, in truth."
1372,Cersei,Tyrion,Are you utterly witless?
1373,Cersei,Tyrion,"And he dares to accuse me of incest, adultery, and treason!"
1374,Arya,Rorge,
1375,Stannis,Tyrion,"Joffrey is my brothers trueborn son and heir, but I mean to take his throne  for all that? I will not suffer to be called a whore!"
1376,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Done in the Light of the Lord,A queer choice of  words, that."
1377,Petyr,Pycelle,These words often appear in letters and documents from the Free Cities.
1378,Petyr,Tyrion,"It is their  usage, I do believe.Varys told us some years past that Lady Selyse had taken up with a red priest,"
1379,Petyr,Tyrion,And now it would seem her lord husband has done the same.
1380,Pycelle,Stannis,". Yes, yes,"
1381,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Any man heard speaking of incest or calling Joffrey a bastard should lose his  tongue for it.A prudent measure,A folly,When you tear out a mans tongue, you are not proving him a liar, youre only  telling the world that you fear what he might say.So what would you have us do?"
1382,Pycelle,Tyrion,Very little.
1383,Stannis,Tyrion,"How could  he, when it never happened?"
1384,Petyr,Tyrion,"Thats so,Still  "
1385,Cersei,Petyr,"If we attempt to  silence this talk, we only lend it credence."
1386,Cersei,Stannis,"And  meantime, fight fire with fire."
1387,Cersei,Stannis,"What sort of fire?A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps."
1388,Cersei,Stannis,"the  smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly  proud as Stannis Baratheon.He has never been much loved, thats true."
1389,Cersei,Selyse,So we pay him back in his  own coin.
1390,Petyr,Tyrion,.Ser Axell Florent is her castellan.
1391,Petyr,Pycelle,"The child has the Florent ears, Im told."
1392,Petyr,Pycelle,"A trade envoy from Lys once observed to me that Lord Stannis must  love his daughter very well, since hed erected hundreds of statues of her all along the walls of  Dragonstone.My lord I had to tell him, those are gargoyles."
1393,Petyr,Pycelle,"Ser Axell might serve for  Shireens father, but in my experience, the more bizarre and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be  repeated.Stannis keeps an especially grotesque fool, a lackwit with a tattooed face."
1394,Petyr,Pycelle,"Surely you do not mean to suggest that Lady Selyse  would bring a fool into her bed?Youd have to be a fool to want to bed Selyse Florent,Doubtless Patchface  reminded her of Stannis."
1395,Cersei,Pycelle,"Shireen has a mottled, halffrozen face as well."
1396,Cersei,Pycelle,"But that is from the greyscale that near killed her as a babe, poor thing.I like my tale better,and so will the smallfolk."
1397,Jaime,Tyrion,"Lord Petyr, you are a wicked  creature.Thank you, Your Grace.And a most accomplished liar,"
1398,Petyr,Tyrion,"We all have our  gifts, my lord."
1399,Cersei,Petyr,"Cuckolded by a halfwit fool!Stannis will be laughed at in every winesink this side of the narrow sea.The story should not come from us,or it will be seen for a self-serving lie."
1400,Cersei,Petyr,"Whores love to gossip, and as it happens I own a brothel  or three.And no doubt Varys can plant seeds in the alehouses and pot-shops.Varys,Where is Varys?I have been wondering about that myself, Your Grace.The Spider spins his secret webs day and night,I mistrust that  one, my lords.And he speaks so kindly of you."
1401,Cersei,Tyrion,"Pray excuse me, my lords.Other business calls."
1402,Cersei,Tyrion,Kings business?Nothing you need trouble yourself about.Ill be the judge of that.Would you spoil my surprise?
1403,Cersei,Tyrion,Im having a gift made for Joffrey.A little chain.What does he need with another chain?
1404,Bronn,Joffrey,  And this chain I believe he may one day treasure  above all others.
1405,Bronn,Tyrion,"The  smiths are in your audience chamber, waiting your pleasure,Waiting my pleasure."
1406,Tanda,Tyrion,"Next youll be  kneeling.Fuck you, dwarf.Thats Shaes task."
1407,Moon,Tyrion,"See that my litter is readied, Ill be leaving the  castle as soon as Im done here."
1408,Podrick,Tyrion,"Your garb, my lord,"
1409,Podrick,Tyrion,For the audience.
1410,Podrick,Tyrion,The Hands chain.Very good.Help me dress.
1411,Bronn,Tyrion,"Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King."
1412,Bronn,Tyrion,"Goodmen, I  know you are all busy, so I will be succinct.Pod, if you please."
1413,Bronn,Tyrion,I had these made at the castle forge.I want a thousand more just like them.
1414,Bronn,Tyrion,"A mighty  chain.Mighty, but short,Somewhat like me."
1415,Bronn,Tyrion,"Do you have  a name?They call me Ironbelly, mlord."
1416,Cersei,Tyrion,I want every forge in Kings Landing turned to making these links and joining them.
1417,Cersei,Tyrion,"Are you that man, Goodman Ironbelly?Might be I am, mlord.But what of the mail and swords the queen was wanting?"
1418,Cersei,Tyrion,"Her Grace commanded us to make chainmail and armor, swords and daggers  and axes, all in great numbers.For arming her new gold cloaks, mlord.That work can wait,The chain first.Mlord, begging your pardon, Her Grace said those as didnt meet  their numbers would have their hands crushed,Smashed on their own  anvils, she said."
1419,Cersei,Tyrion,"No one will have their hands smashed.You have my word on it.Iron is grown dear,and this chain will be needing much of it, and coke beside, for  the fires.Lord Baelish will see that you have coin as you need it,"
1420,Petyr,Tyrion,I will command the City Watch to help you find iron.Melt down  every horseshoe in this city if you must.
1421,Petyr,Tyrion,"My lord,"
1422,Chett,Tyrion,Not this.
1423,Chett,Tyrion,"What is your name,  master armorer?Salloreon, as it please my lord.if the Kings Hand will permit, I should be most honored to forge him a  suit of armor suitable to his House and high office."
1424,Bronn,Tyrion,"Plate and scale, I think."
1425,Bronn,Tyrion,"When  you ride into battle, men will shrink away in fear."
1426,Bronn,Tyrion,"Master Salloreon, I plan to  fight the rest of my battles from this chair."
1427,Bronn,Tyrion,The choice is yours.
1428,Bronn,Tyrion,"You know where  were bound,"
1429,Bronn,Robert,"A brothel,What do you mean to do here?What does one usually do in a brothel?"
1430,Bronn,Robert,"Shaes not enough?She was pretty enough for a camp follower, but Im no longer in camp.Little men have big appetites,  and Im told the girls here are fit for a king.Is the boy old enough?Not Joffrey."
1431,Joffrey,Robert,This house was a great favorite of his.
1432,Bronn,Joffrey,"If you and the Black Ears care to amuse yourselves, feel free, but  Chatayas girls are costly."
1433,Bronn,Joffrey,Leave one man here wholl  know where to find the others when I wish to return.
1434,Bronn,Joffrey,As you say.
1435,Bronn,Joffrey,"I am Chataya,And you are-Let us not get into the habit of names."
1436,Bronn,Tyrion,You have a pleasant  establishment.I have labored long to make it so.I am glad the Hand is pleased.
1437,Bronn,Tyrion,"Titles can be as dangerous as names,Show me a few of your girls.It will be my great delight.You will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful, and skilled in    every art of love."
1438,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I would respectfully suggest the dark-skinned girl,Shes young.She has sixteen years, my lord."
1439,Bronn,Tyrion,"Does she come from your home lands, this girl?Her blood is the blood of summer, my lord, but my daughter was born here in Kings Landing."
1440,Shae,Tyrion,"Many highborn youths and maidens serve for a few years after their flowerings, to honor the  gods.What do the gods have to do with it?The gods made our bodies as well as our souls, is it not so?"
1441,Shae,Tyrion,"And they give us desire, so we  might mate and worship them in that way.Remind me to tell the High Septon,If I could pray with my cock, Id be much more  religious."
1442,Shae,Tyrion,I will gladly accept your suggestion.I shall summon my daughter.Come.
1443,Shae,Tyrion,"My name is Alayaya,Come, my lord."
1444,Alayaya,Tyrion,"You are very beautiful, Alayaya,From head to heels, every  part of you is lovely.Yet just now the part that interests me most is your tongue.My lord will find my tongue well schooled.When I was a girl I learned when to use it, and when not.That pleases me."
1445,Alayaya,Tyrion,"So what shall we do now?Perchance you have some suggestion?Yes,If my lord will open the wardrobe, he will find what he seeks."
1446,Alla,Tyrion,"Was Chatayas  to your satisfaction, my lord?Almost too much so,Youre certain this woman can be relied on?I am certain of nothing in this fickle and treacherous world, my lord."
1447,Alla,Allar,Shall we go?
1448,Tyrion,Varys,"I like this new garb of yours,The work I do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights.So when I leave the  castle, I adopt more suitable guises, and thus live to serve you longer.Leather becomes you.You ought to come like this to our next council session.Your sister would not approve, my lord.My sister would soil her smallclothes."
1449,Tyrion,Varys,"I saw no signs of any of her spies  skulking after me.I am pleased to hear it, my lord."
1450,Tyrion,Varys,"I  should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen.-well, rd hate to think I was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of frustrated lust all for  naught.Scarcely for naught,They know you are here.Whether any will be bold enough to  enter Chatayas in the guise of patrons I cannot say, but I find it best to err on the side of caution.How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?The tunnel was dug for another Kings Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house  openly.Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence.And yet you knew of it.Little birds fly through many a dark tunnel.Careful, the steps are steep."
1451,Tyrion,Varys,"Old,and I have my doubts  about his wind.He is not a mount to carry you into battle, true,"
1452,Tyrion,Varys,And the stableboys see and hear only the animals.
1453,Tyrion,Varys,If you will permit me.
1454,Tyrion,Varys,"Men see what they expect to see,Dwarfs are not so common a sight as children, so a child is what they will see."
1455,Tyrion,Varys,Though it would be best if you came most  often by night.I plan to .
1456,Tyrion,Varys,"At the moment, though, Shae awaits me."
1457,Tyrion,Varys,Which horse will you have?
1458,Tyrion,Varys,This one will do well enough.I shall saddle him for you.
1459,Tyrion,Varys,"You missed a lively council.Stannis has crowned  himself, it seems.I know.He accuses my brother and sister of incest.I wonder how he came by that suspicion.Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastards hair, as Eddard Stark did, and Jon Arryn  before him.Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear."
1460,Tyrion,Varys,"Someone like you, perchance?Am I suspected?It was not me.if it had been, would you admit it?No."
1461,Tyrion,Varys,"Besides, the bastards were  there for all to see.Roberts bastards?What of them?He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing,Their  mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all black as ravens ."
1462,Tyrion,Varys,"So when Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen slid out between your sisters thighs,  each as golden as the sun, the truth was not hard to glimpse."
1463,Cersei,Varys,"If you were not this whisperer, who  was?Some traitor, doubtless."
1464,Tyrion,Varys,Petyr?I named no name.
1465,Tyrion,Varys,"Lord Varys,sometimes I feel as though  you are the best friend I have in Kings Landing, and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy.How odd.I think quite the same of you."
1466,Bran,Luwin,"Listen, and it may be that you will learn  something of what lordship is all about,"
1467,Robb,Rodrik,"You are  your brothers heir and the Stark in Winterfell,"
1468,Bran,Rodrik,"The feast makes a pleasant pretext,but a man does not cross a hundred  leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine."
1469,Bran,Hodor,"The white wool doublet today,And  the silver brooch.Ser Rodrik will want me to look lordly."
1470,Bran,Hodor,"You could have been a knight too, I bet,If the gods hadnt taken your wits, you would have been a great knight.Hodor?"
1471,Bran,Hodor,"Yes,Hodor."
1472,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor,"
1473,Bran,Hodor,"Now theres an ugly horse,Hodors no horse,Hodor,"
1474,Big,Walder,"Well, hes not as smart as a horse, thats for certain."
1475,Hodor,Walder,Hodor.
1476,Bran,Walder,Hodor  hodor?
1477,Bran,Walder,"See, theyre talking to each other.Maybe hodor means I love you in  horse.You shut up, Frey."
1478,Big,Walder,"What will you  do if I dont?Hell set his wolf on you, cousin,Let him.I always wanted a wolfskin cloak.Summer would tear your fat head off,"
1479,Luwin,Walder,"Does your wolf have steel teeth, to bite  through plate and mail?Enough!"
1480,Luwin,Walder,"These  threats are unseemly, and Ill hear no more of them.Is this how you behave at the Twins, Walder Frey?If I want to."
1481,Big,Walder,"Well, it is not how Lady Starks wards ought behave at Winterfell.Whats at the root of this?"
1482,Big,Walder,"One of you will tell me, I swear, or-We were having a jape with Hodor,I am sorry if we offended Prince Bran.We only meant to be amusing."
1483,Bran,Walder,"And me,I was only being amusing too."
1484,Bran,Luwin,"A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless,I will  not have you making Hodor the butt of cruel jests, do you hear me?Hes a goodhearted lad, dutiful and  obedient, which is more than I can say for either of you."
1485,Luwin,Walder,"And you will stay out of the godswood and away from those wolves, or answer for it."
1486,Bran,Hodor,Bran.
1487,Bran,Hodor,"Lord Wyman awaits.Hodor, go with the maester,Hodor,"
1488,Hodor,Luwin,"The Walders-Ill hear no more of that, its done."
1489,Rodrik,Wyman,"You were right to  defend Hodor, but you should never have been there."
1490,Bran,Wyman,"Must I come myself to fetch you, as if you were a little child?No,Im sorry.I know what you wanted,Would  that it could be, Bran.Do you have any questions before we begin this audience? Will we talk of the war?You will talk of naught."
1491,Bran,Luwin,You are still a child of eight   the maester repeated firmly.
1492,Bran,Luwin,Ill remember.I will say nothing to Ser Rodrik of what passed between you and the Frey boys.Thank you.
1493,Bran,Wyman,"Why, no prince is ever late,Those who arrive before  him have come early, thats all."
1494,Bran,Robb,"King Robb needs his own coinage as well,and White Harbor is the very place to mint it."
1495,Bran,Robb,"We have had no strength  at sea for hundreds of years, since Brandon the Burner put the torch to his fathers ships.Grant me the  gold and within the year I will float you sufficient galleys to take Dragonstone and Kings Landing both."
1496,Catelyn,Wyman,"She was born a Manderly, you know.Perhaps, when her grief has  run its course, she would like to be a Manderly again, eh?"
1497,Catelyn,Wyman,"As it happens, I am a widower these past eight years."
1498,Catelyn,Wyman,A man does get lonely.
1499,Bran,Catelyn,"Or if the lady  fancies a younger lad, well, my son Wendel is unwed as well."
1500,Bran,Catelyn,"just the man to teach her to  laugh again, eh?"
1501,Rodrik,Wyl,"He offers him back to me without ransom, provided I withdraw my levies from His Grace and  vow to fight no more.You will refuse him, of course,Have no fear on that count,King Robb has no more loyal servant than Wyman  Manderly."
1502,Bran,Wyl,"Gallant, that son of  mine, and fierce as a mastiff."
1503,Bran,Donella,"We are very sorry for all you have suffered, my lady,"
1504,Bran,Rodrik,Winterfell will  remember.That is good to know.
1505,Bran,Rodrik,"I am  very weary, my lord.If I might have leave to rest, I should be thankful.To be sure,There is time enough for talk on the morrow."
1506,Luwin,Rodrik,"Boltons bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort,I hope he means to take them  south to join his father at the Twins, but when I sent to ask his intent, he told me that no Bolton would be  questioned by a woman.As if he were trueborn and had a right to that name.Lord Bolton has never acknowledged the boy, so far as I know,I confess, I do not  know him.Few do,He lived with his mother until two years past, when young Domeric died and left  Bolton without an heir."
1507,Bran,Rodrik,"And now that my lord husband and my sweet son have gone to the  gods, the Bastard looks at my lands hungrily."
1508,Luwin,Mors,"though perhaps in time, when your grief is passed, you may find it prudent to wed again.I am past my childbearing years, what beauty I had long fled,yet  men come sniffing after me as they never did when I was a maid.You do not look favorably on these suitors?"
1509,Luwin,Mors,"I shall wed again if His Grace commands it,but Mors Crowfood is a  drunken brute, and older than my father."
1510,Luwin,Rodrik,"You will have other suitors, my lady.We shall try and find you a prospect more to your taste.Perhaps you need not look very far, ser."
1511,Luwin,Rodrik,"Ser Rodrik, I do believe my lady fancies you."
1512,Bran,Rodrik,"She was very sad,"
1513,Bran,Rodrik,"Sad and gentle, and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years, for all her  modesty.Yet a danger to the peace of your brothers realm nonetheless.Her?"
1514,Bran,Luwin,"With no direct heir, there are sure to be many claimants contending for the  Hornwood lands."
1515,Harys,Rodrik,"The Dreadfort has  no claim that I know, but the lands adjoin, and Roose Bolton is not one to overlook such a chance."
1516,Bran,Rodrik,"In such cases, her liege lord must find her a suitable match.Why cant you marry her?"
1517,Bran,Rodrik,"You said she was comely, and Beth would have a mother."
1518,Bran,Jon,"A kindly thought, my prince, but I am only a knight, and  besides too old.I might hold her lands for a few years, but as soon as I died Lady Hornwood would find  herself back in the same mire, and Beths prospects might be perilous as well.Then let Lord Hornwoods bastard be the heir,That would please the Glovers, and perhaps Lord Hornwoods shade as well, but I do  not think Lady Hornwood would love us. said Maester Luwin, "
1519,Bran,Donella,"if not the bastard, who?May I be excused?"
1520,Bran,Rodrik,"As you will, my prince,You did well."
1521,Bran,Rickon,"Shaggy,Here, Shaggydog.To me."
1522,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor, HodorHow can you swim in there?"
1523,Bran,Osha,"Isnt it cold?As a babe I suckled on icicles, boy.I like the cold."
1524,Bran,Osha,I wanted to  touch the bottom.I never knew there was a bottom.Might be there isnt.
1525,Bran,Osha,"What are you staring at, boy?Never seen a woman before?I have so."
1526,Bran,Osha,Youve got a lot of scars.Every one hard earned.
1527,Bran,Osha,Fighting giants?
1528,Bran,Osha,Fighting men.
1529,Bran,Osha,"Black crows, oft as not."
1530,Bran,Mordane,Heard some  yattering in the kitchen today about you and them Freys.Who?What did they say?
1531,Bran,Mordane,"That its a fool boy who mocks a giant, and a mad world when a cripple has  to defend him.Hodor never knew they were mocking him,Anyhow he never fights."
1532,Hodor,Mordane,Hodor!
1533,Hodor,Walder,"Septon Chayle says he has a gentle spirit.Aye,"
1534,Osha,Walder,"Big outside, little inside, and mean down to the bones.Hed never dare hurt me.Hes scared of Summer, no matter what he says.Then might be hes not so stupid as he seems."
1535,Osha,Walder,Or  might be he is.And that tastes of trouble too.
1536,Bran,Osha,You have more of them wolf  dreams?No.
1537,Bran,Osha,A prince should lie better than that.
1538,Bran,Osha,"Well, your dreams are your business."
1539,Bran,Hodor,"By your leave, my prince."
1540,Luwin,Mors,"The Greatjons  the Young Wolfs strong right hand, all know that to be true.Who better to protect the widows lands  than an Umber, and what Umber better than me?Lady Donella is still grieving,I have a cure for grief under my furs."
1541,Hot,Hother,"Theres wildlings stealing down from the north, more than Ive ever seen before."
1542,Greatjon,Rodrik,Half our harvest is gone to seed for want of arms to swing the  scythes.
1543,Greatjon,Rodrik,You have forests of tall pine and old oak.
1544,Lamprey,Mors,Together you ought to be able to float enough longships to guard both  your coasts.Manderly?
1545,Lamprey,Mors,That great waddling sack of suet?
1546,Bran,Lamprey,"If you stuck a sword in his belly, ten thousand eels  would wriggle out.He is fat,but he is not stupid."
1547,Bran,Galbart,"My lady begs that you excuse her absence.Her  babes are still too young for such a journey, and she was loath to leave them."
1548,Bran,Luwin,"Your notion about the bastard may have merit, Bran,One day you will be a  good lord for Winterfell, I think.,,  "
1549,Beth,Bran,"Robbs to marry  some Frey girl, you told me so yourself, and the Walders say the same.Hell have sons, and theyll be the  lords of Winterfell after him, not me.It may be so, Bran,"
1550,Leo,Leobald,When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain.
1551,Leo,Leobald,Benfred has raised his own company of lances.
1552,Benfred,Bran,"Now they call themselves the Wild Hares and gallop  about the country with rabbitskins tied to the ends of their lances, singing songs of chivalry."
1553,Leo,Leobald,"If the king were in need of more men, he  would send for them,Instruct your nephew that he is to remain at Torrhens Square, as his lord  father commanded.I will, ser,"
1554,Donella,Leobald,An empty hall is a sad one.
1555,Leo,Luwin,If he were named heir?
1556,Leo,Luwin,.
1557,Cersei,Joffrey,
1558,Bran,Leobald,"Thank you for the notion, my lord,We will bring the matter to my brother Robb.Oh, and Lady Hornwood."
1559,Bran,Leobald,"Im grateful, my prince,"
1560,Leo,Leobald,"Beren Tallhart may well be our best answer,By blood he is half Hornwood."
1561,Leo,Leobald,..
1562,Leobald,Mors," said Ser Rodrik, "
1563,Luwin,Roose,"Robb should have our best  counsel before he makes his decision.It may come down to practicalities,Which lord he most needs to court."
1564,Bran,Rodrik,   said Bran.
1565,Bran,Cley,"Good morrow, Bran,Or must I call you Prince Bran now?Only if you want."
1566,Bran,Cley,Why not?
1567,Bran,Cley,"Did Stannis write Winterfell as  well?Stannis?I dont know.Hes a king now too,He says Queen Cersei bedded her brother, so Joffrey is a  bastard.Joffrey the Illborn,Small wonder hes faithless, with the  Kingslayer for a father.Aye,the gods hate incest."
1568,Bran,Cley,Bran?
1569,Bran,Cley,Are you unwell?Its only another    king.Robb will beat him too.
1570,Bran,Cley,Fly or die!
1571,Bran,Pycelle,Help me!
1572,Bran,Pycelle,"The things I do for love,"
1573,Pycelle,Tyrion,"I do not sleep as I did when I was younger,I would sooner  be up, though the world be dark, than lie restless abed, fretting on tasks undone,"
1574,Pycelle,Tyrion,"In these sad times, when so many hunger, I think it only fitting to  keep my table spare.Commendable,I take a different view.If there is food I eat it, in case there is none on the  morrow."
1575,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Tell me, are your ravens early risers as well?"
1576,Pycelle,Tyrion,To be sure.Shall I send for quill and ink  after we have eaten?No need.
1577,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Send your girl away, so we can talk.Leave us, child,"
1578,Pycelle,Tyrion,"These letters, now ."
1579,Pycelle,Tyrion,".For the eyes of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne."
1580,Pycelle,Tyrion,"One    letter, in two copies."
1581,Pycelle,Tyrion,The matter is of great import.I shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast.Dispatch them now.
1582,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Lord Renly is leading his host up the  roseroad, and no one can say when Lord Stannis will sail from Dragonstone."
1583,Pycelle,Tyrion,If my lord prefers-He does.I am here to serve.
1584,Pycelle,Tyrion,"It is done, my lord."
1585,Pycelle,Tyrion,A matter like this .
1586,Pycelle,Tyrion,"of great import, you say?Oh, yes."
1587,Pycelle,Tyrion,"The Prince of Dorne, himself.Best not.As you say."
1588,Pycelle,Tyrion,Mayhaps .
1589,Pycelle,Tyrion,.
1590,Pycelle,Tyrion,"The council exists to advise the king,  Maester.Just so,and the king--is a boy of thirteen."
1591,Pycelle,Tyrion,..
1592,Pycelle,Tyrion,Do you?
1593,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Ah,Doubtless you have the right of it, my lord."
1594,Pycelle,Tyrion,burden.Thats just the sort of fellow I am.
1595,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Considerate.Cersei  is my own sweet sister, after all.And a woman, to be sure,A most uncommon woman, and yet ."
1596,Eddard,Pycelle,.
1597,Eddard,Pycelle,Im pleased you share my concern.
1598,Eddard,Pycelle,But a long day awaits.
1599,Eddard,Pycelle,"Be so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from Dorne? As you say, my lord.And only me?Ah ."
1600,Pycelle,Tyrion,to be sure.
1601,Tallad,Tyrion,"Bronn, I despair of you."
1602,Tallad,Tyrion,"With sweet sights like that before you, all  you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor.There are a hundred whorehouses in this city where a clipped copper will buy me all the cunt I want,but one day my life may hang on how close Ive watched your louts."
1603,Bronn,Tallad,Whos the boy in the checkered blue surcoat with the three eyes on his shield?Some hedge knight.
1604,Bronn,Tallad,Why?
1605,Bronn,Tallad,"Hes the best of them.But watch him, he falls into a rhythm,  delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks."
1606,Bronn,Tyrion,"That will be the death  of him, the day he faces me.Hes pledged to Joffrey; hes not like to face you."
1607,Bronn,Tyrion,How many supplicants do  we have today?
1608,Bronn,Tyrion,"Thirty odd,Most with complaints, or wanting something, as ever.Your pet was  back."
1609,Bronn,Tyrion,Lady Tanda?Her page.
1610,Tanda,Tyrion,  
1611,Bronn,Tyrion,Send  her my regrets.No taste for stuffed goose?
1612,Bronn,Tyrion,"Perhaps you should eat the goose and marry the maid.Or better still, send Shagga.Shaggas more like to eat the maid and marry the goose,Anyway, Lollys outweighs  him.There is that,Who else wants me?"
1613,Petyr,Tyrion,"Theres a moneylender from Braavos, holding fancy papers and the  like, requests to see the king about payment on some loan.As if Joffrey could count past twenty."
1614,Gregor,Tyrion,"Next?A lordling down from the Trident, says your fathers men burned his keep, raped his wife, and killed all  his peasants.I believe they call that war."
1615,Amory,Bronn,"What does he want of Joffrey?New peasants,He walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for recompense.Ill make time for him on the morrow."
1616,Amory,Bronn,"See that hes given a comfortable chamber and a hot meal.Send him a new pair of  boots as well, good ones, courtesy of King Joffrey."
1617,Bronn,Tyrion,"Theres also a great gaggle of bakers, butchers, and greengrocers clamoring to  be heard.I told them last time, I have nothing to give them."
1618,Stannis,Tyrion,They want protection.
1619,Stannis,Tyrion,"The mob claimed he charged  too much for bread.Did he?Hes not apt to deny it.They didnt eat him, did they?Not that Ive heard.Next time they will,I give them what protection I can.   Bronn said."
1620,Alliser,Tyrion,"Tell them King  Joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for them.They want bread, not promises.If I give them bread today, on the morrow Ill have twice as many at the gates.Who else?A black brother down from the Wall.The steward says he brought some rotted hand in a jar."
1621,Alliser,Tyrion,Im surprised no one ate it.
1622,Alliser,Tyrion,"Its not Yoren,  perchance?No."
1623,Alliser,Tyrion,Thorne.Ser Alliser Thorne?
1624,Bronn,Tyrion,"Come to think on it, I dont believe I care to see  Ser Alliser just now.Find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year, and let his hand  rot a little more."
1625,Cersei,Janos,"Brother,"
1626,Janos,Tyrion,Your Grace.
1627,Janos,Tyrion,You look lovely this morning.
1628,Cersei,Tyrion,"Where are you bound this day, sister?"
1629,Cersei,Tyrion,Im making a round of the gates to inspect the new scorpions and spitfires.I would not have it thought  that all of us are as indifferent to the citys defense as you seem to be.
1630,Cersei,Tyrion,"I am informed that Renly Baratheon has marched  from Highgarden.He is making his way up the roseroad, with all his strength behind him.Varys gave me the same report.He could be here by the full moon.Not at his present leisurely pace,He feasts every night in a different castle, and  holds court at every crossroads he passes.And every day, more men rally to his banners.His host is now said to be a hundred thousand strong.That seems rather high.He has the power of Storms End and Highgarden behind him, you little fool,All the Tyrell bannermen but for the Redwynes, and you have me to thank for that.So long as I  hold those poxy twins of his, Lord Paxter will squat on the Arbor and count himself fortunate to be out of  it.A pity you let the Knight of Flowers slip through your pretty fingers."
1631,Cersei,Renly,"And if it goes the other way, he can descend on us while we are  weakened."
1632,Cersei,Renly,I want you to make Father bring his army to Kings Landing.
1633,Cersei,Tyrion,When have I ever been able to make Father  do anything?
1634,Cersei,Tyrion,And when do you plan to free Jaime?Hes worth a hundred of you.
1635,Cersei,Tyrion,"Dont tell Lady Stark, I beg you.We dont have a hundred of me to trade.Father must have been mad to send you.Youre worse than useless."
1636,Podrick,Tyrion,"Hes inside,Your solar."
1637,Podrick,Tyrion,Sorry.
1638,Podrick,Tyrion,"Look at me, Pod."
1639,Podrick,Tyrion,Who is inside my solar?Lord Petyr.
1640,Podrick,Tyrion,"I meant,  Lord Petyr."
1641,Podrick,Tyrion,The master of coin. You make him sound a crowd.
1642,Petyr,Tyrion,"The king is fighting hares with a crossbow,The hares are winning.Come  see."
1643,Joffrey,Tyrion,Now!
1644,Joffrey,Petyr,Another!
1645,Petyr,Podrick,"Boy, are you fond of potted hare?"
1646,Petyr,Tyrion,"To eat, my lord?Invest in pots,Hares will soon overrun the castle.Well be eating hare thrice a  day.Better than rats on a skewer,Pod, leave us.Unless Lord Petyr would care for some  refreshment?Thank you, but no."
1647,Petyr,Tyrion,"Drink with the dwarf, its said, and you  wake up walking the Wall.Black brings out my unhealthy pallor."
1648,Petyr,Tyrion,"You look very elegant today, my lord.Im wounded.I strive to look elegant every day.Is the doublet new?It is.Youre most observant.Plum and yellow.Are those the colors of your House?No.But a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out, or so Ive found.Thats a handsome knife as well.Is it?"
1649,Petyr,Tyrion,"Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt."
1650,Petyr,Tyrion,"Its yours, if you would  like it.Mine?"
1651,Petyr,Tyrion,No.
1652,Petyr,Tyrion,Never mine.
1653,Petyr,Tyrion,"Ah, His Grace has killed a hare,No doubt a slow one,My lord, you were fostered at Riverrun.Ive heard it said that you  grew close to the Tullys.You might say so.The girls especially.How close?I had their maidenhoods.Is that close enough?"
1654,Sansa,Tyrion,"Lord  Hosters daughters do not love me,I doubt they would listen to any proposal I might  make.Yet coming from you, the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears. That would depend on the words."
1655,Lysa,Sansa,"Joffrey will never surrender his plaything, and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter  the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl.I mean to have Arya as well.I have men searching.Searching is not finding.Ill keep that in mind, my lord."
1656,Lysa,Petyr,"For her, I have a  sweeter offer.Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn, true ."
1657,Lysa,Petyr,"but also more fearful, and I understand she hates you.She believes she has good reason.When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she insisted that Id murdered her  husband and was not inclined to listen to denials."
1658,Lysa,Petyr,"If I gave her Jon Arryns true  killer, she might think more kindly of me."
1659,Petyr,Tyrion,True killer?
1660,Petyr,Tyrion,Who do you propose?
1661,Petyr,Tyrion,"Gifts I give my friends, freely.Lysa Arryn would need to understand that.Is it her friendship you require, or her swords?Both."
1662,Moon,Petyr,Lysa has woes of her own.
1663,Moon,Tyrion,"and better armed.Distressing,I could help her with that."
1664,Petyr,Tyrion,".And what would this word cost her?I want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king, to swear fealty, and to make war on the  Starks and Tullys?"
1665,Petyr,Renly,"Theres the roach in your pudding, Lannister.Lysa will  never send her knights against Riverrun.Nor would I ask it."
1666,Jon,Stannis,"I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East, as  his father was before him."
1667,Jon,Petyr,"And to seal  the bargain, I will give her my niece."
1668,Petyr,Tyrion,"Myrcella?When she comes of age, she can wed little Lord Robert.Until such time, shell be Lady Lysas ward at  the Eyrie.And what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy?"
1669,Petyr,Tyrion,I thought not.
1670,Petyr,Tyrion,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa."
1671,Petyr,Tyrion,If I cared to.
1672,Petyr,Tyrion,"So,whats in your pot for me?Harrenhal."
1673,Petyr,Tyrion,"Harrenhal is cursed,Then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself."
1674,Petyr,Tyrion,Let them do you  fealty for their lands.Even the Tullys?If there are any Tullys left when we are done.
1675,Lysa,Tyrion,"Harrenhal and all its lands and incomes,With  a stroke, youd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.Not that Im ungrateful, my lord,  but-why?You served my sister well in the matter of the succession.As did Janos Slynt.On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently bestowed-only to be  snatched away when he was no longer of use."
1676,Lysa,Tyrion,"You have me, my lord."
1677,Lysa,Petyr,I did not  need Janos Slynt.
1678,Lysa,Petyr,"Id sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated  on the Iron Throne.What could be plainer?What indeed.You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage?I have little doubt youll be equal to the task.I once told Eddard Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman, the only thing to do is  close your eyes and get on with it."
1679,Petyr,Tyrion,Give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to Gulltown.That will do nicely.
1680,Petyr,Tyrion,"This has been quite the pleasant morning, Lannister."
1681,Petyr,Tyrion,"for both of us, I  trust."
1682,Doran,Varys,"You are a cruel man, to make the Grand Maester squirm so,The man cannot abide a secret.Is that a crow I hear, calling the raven black?Or would you sooner not hear what Ive proposed to  Doran Martell?"
1683,Doran,Varys,"Perhaps my little birds have told me.Have they, indeed?"
1684,Doran,Varys,Go on.The Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars.
1685,Renly,Tyrion,"You wish to dissuade him.All this is obvious,The only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance.The prince is a sentimental man, and  he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe.My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition ."
1686,Tyrion,Varys,"and it happens we    have an empty seat on the small council, now that Lord Janos has taken the black.A council seat is not to be despised,yet will it be enough to make a proud man forget  his sisters murder?Why forget?"
1687,Tyrion,Varys,"Ive promised to deliver his sisters killers, alive or dead, as he prefers.After the war is done, to be sure."
1688,Tyrion,Varys,My little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried a .
1689,Gregor,Varys,when they came for her.Is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it?
1690,Elia,Varys,This secret is your lord fathers sworn man.My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog.
1691,Elia,Varys,And if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the  command as well as the knight who did the deed .
1692,Elia,Varys,".Robert Baratheon led the rebellion.All commands came from him, in the end.Robert was not at Kings Landing.Neither was Doran Martell.So."
1693,Tyrion,Varys,"Some token of good faith, some sure safeguard against betrayal."
1694,Tommen,Tyrion,"Which one will you give him, I wonder?"
1695,Tommen,Tyrion,"You know, dont you?Since you put it that way-yes."
1696,Tommen,Tyrion,"You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa  Arryn both.Remind me never to play these guessing games with you again.You cheat. Prince Tornmen is a good boy.If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while hes still young, he may even grow to be a good man.And a good king?Joffrey is king.And Tornmen is heir, should anything ill befall His Grace."
1697,Doran,Tommen,"tractable.You have a suspicious mind, Varys.I shall take that as a tribute, my lord."
1698,Doran,Myrcella,but for one small flaw.
1699,Doran,Myrcella,Named Cersei?What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb?
1700,Myrcella,Varys,"Surely not.What Cersei does not know will never hurt me.And if Her Grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe?Why,then I would know the man who told her to be my certain enemy."
1701,Meryn,Sansa,"Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go  home,"
1702,Joffrey,Sansa,I hope the Others get him.
1703,Ilyn,Sansa,What do you want?
1704,Ilyn,Sansa,"Will milady be wanting a bath tonight?A fire, I think ."
1705,Ilyn,Sansa,I feel a chill.
1706,Ilyn,Sansa,As you wish.
1707,Chett,Sansa,"I feared you would not come, child."
1708,Arya,Sansa,"Ser Dontos,Was it you?Yes, my lady."
1709,Arya,Sansa,Me.
1710,Arya,Sansa,Dont!
1711,Arya,Sansa,What .
1712,Arya,Sansa,"what do  you want with me?Only to help you,as you helped me.Youre drunk, arent you?Only one cup of wine, to help my courage.If they catch me now, theyll strip the skin off my back."
1713,Dontos,Joffrey,Are you going to stab me?
1714,Dontos,Joffrey,"I will,Tell me who sent you.No one, sweet lady.I swear it on my honor as a knight.A knight?"
1715,Joffrey,Moon,"I prayed to the gods for a knight to come save me,I prayed and prayed.Why would  they send me a drunken old fool?I deserve that, though ."
1716,Dontos,Sansa,"You saved me, not only from Joffrey, but from  myself."
1717,Dontos,Sansa,The singers say there was another fool once who was the greatest knight of  all  
1718,Dontos,Sansa,"Sweet lady, I would be your Florian,"
1719,Dontos,Sansa,How .
1720,Dontos,Sansa,Get me away?
1721,Dontos,Sansa,"Taking you from the castle, that will be the hardest."
1722,Dontos,Sansa,"Id need to find the coin and make the arrangements, thats all.Could we go now?"
1723,Dontos,Sansa,This very night?
1724,Dontos,Sansa,They watch me as well.
1725,Dontos,Sansa,Will you  put away your blade?
1726,Dontos,Sansa,"Rise, ser.Thank you, sweet lady."
1727,Dontos,Joffrey,"Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay  him."
1728,Barristan,Dontos,"My life is a poor  thing, but it is yours."
1729,Barristan,Dontos,"I vow, with your fathers gods as witness, that I shall send you home."
1730,Barristan,Dontos,Then .
1731,Dontos,Sansa,Will you send me another note?
1732,Dontos,Sansa,The risk is too great.
1733,Dontos,Sansa,"The stones have ears in the Red  Keep, and only here may we talk freely.Only here,Ill remember.And if I should seem cruel or mocking or indifferent when men are watching, forgive me, child."
1734,Dontos,Sansa,One misstep and our heads will adorn the walls as did your  fathers.
1735,Dontos,Sansa,I understand.You will need to be brave and strong .
1736,Dontos,Sansa,"and patient, patient above all.I will be,"
1737,Dontos,Sansa,".So am I,And now you must go, before you are missed.You will not come with me?Better if we are never seen together."
1738,Dontos,Sansa,"My Florian,The gods heard my prayer."
1739,Sandor,Sansa,"Its a long roll down the serpentine, little bird.Want to kill us both?"
1740,Sandor,Sansa,Maybe you do.
1741,Sandor,Sansa,"No, my lord, pardons, Id never."
1742,Sandor,Sansa,"Please, youre hurting me."
1743,Sandor,Sansa,And whats Joffreys little bird doing flying down the serpentine in the black of night?
1744,Sandor,Sansa,"Where were you? The g-g-godswood, my lord,Praying ."
1745,Sandor,Sansa,"for  the king, praying that hed not be hurt.Think Im so drunk that Id believe that?"
1746,Sandor,Sansa,You look almost a woman .
1747,Chett,Sandor,"You like knights, dont you?"
1748,Maegor,Sandor,"T-true knights, my lord.True knights,And Im no lord, no more than Im a knight.Do I need to beat that into  you?"
1749,Maegor,Sandor,"Gods,"
1750,Maegor,Sandor,Or a woman.
1751,Maegor,Sandor,"Drunk as a dog, damn me."
1752,Maegor,Sandor,Keep you safe for the king.
1753,Boros,Sandor,"That one is nothing to fear, girl."
1754,Boros,Sandor,"Paint stripes on a toad,  he does not become a tiger."
1755,Boros,Sandor,"Ser, where-"
1756,Boros,Sansa,"Im the kings dog, remember? The king was looking for his dog earlier.The dog was drinking."
1757,Boros,Sansa,You and my other brothers.
1758,Boros,Sansa,"How is it you are not in your chambers at this hour, lady?I went to the godswood to pray for the safety of the king."
1759,Boros,Sansa,You expect her to sleep with all the noise?
1760,Boros,Sansa,"What was the trouble? Fools at the gate,Some loose tongues spread tales of the preparations for  Tyreks wedding feast, and these wretches got it in their heads they should be feasted too.His Grace led  a sortie and sent them scurrying.A brave boy,"
1761,Renly,Tywin,Why do you let people call you  a dog?
1762,Sandor,Spare,And hell  look you straight in the face.
1763,Sandor,Spare,"And thats more than little birds can do, isnt it?I never got my song.I ."
1764,Sandor,Spare,I know a song about Florian and Jonquil.Florian and Jonquil?
1765,Sandor,Spare,"But one day Ill have a song from you, whether you  will it or no.I will sing it for you gladly."
1766,Sandor,Spare,"Pretty thing, and such a bad liar."
1767,Sandor,Spare,and every one better than you.
1768,Arya,Gendry,"They would have  burned the lake if they could have,"
1769,Arya,Gendry,"Theyre killed, every one,And dogs have been at them too, look.Or wolves.Dogs, wolves, it makes no matter.Its done here."
1770,Gendry,Weasel,"You were up there a long time.What could you see?A fishing village, just a little place, north along the shore."
1771,Lommy,Weasel,Someones there.
1772,Gendry,Weasel,Did you see people?
1773,Gendry,Weasel,"Mostly just roofs,but some chimneys were smoking, and I heard a horse."
1774,Gendry,Hot,"If theres people, theres food,"
1775,Gendry,Hot,"Might be theyd give us some.Might be theyd kill us too,Not if we yielded,Now you sound like Lommy."
1776,Arya,Lommy,"We have to yield,Thats what Yoren should have done.He should have opened the gates like  they said."
1777,Gendry,Hot,"They told Yoren to open the gates, they told him in the kings name."
1778,Arya,Gendry,"If hed of yielded, they would have  left us be."
1779,Arya,Gendry,"Knights and lordlings, they take each other captive and pay ransoms, but they dont  care if the likes of you yield or not."
1780,Arya,Hot,"What else did you see?If its a fishing village, theyd sell us fish, I bet,"
1781,Arya,Weasel,I dont know about fish.
1782,Hot,Lommy,"Theres crows down by the water.Somethings dead there.Fish, washed up on shore,If the crows eat it, I bet we could.We should catch some crows, we could eat them,We could make a fire and roast them  like chickens."
1783,Arya,Lommy,"I said, no  fires.Lommys hungry,and I am too.Were all hungry,Youre not,Worm breath."
1784,Arya,Lommy,"I said Id dig worms for you too, if you wanted."
1785,Arya,Lommy,"If it wasnt for my leg, Id hunt us some boars.Some boars,You need a boarspear to hunt boars, and horses and dogs, and men to    flush the boar from its lair."
1786,Gendry,Hot,What do you know about hunting boars?
1787,Gendry,Hot,More than you.
1788,Gendry,Hot,"Quiet, both of you, I need to think what to do."
1789,Hot,Lommy,"Yield,I told you to shut up about the yielding."
1790,Gendry,Hot,"Maybe we can steal some  food.Lommy could steal, if it wasnt for his leg,He was a thief in the city.A bad thief,or he wouldnt have got caught."
1791,Arya,Gendry,"Evenfall will be the best time to sneak in.Ill go scout come dark.No, Ill go,Youre too noisy."
1792,Gendry,Lommy,"Well both go.Arry should go,Hes sneakier than you are.Well both go, I said.But what if you dont come back?"
1793,Arya,Hot,".And theres wolves,I heard them last night, when I had the watch.They sounded close."
1794,Gendry,Hot,"And you wont even let us have a fire to keep them off,Its not right, leaving us for the  wolves.No one is leaving you,Lommy has his spear if the wolves come, and youll be  with him.Were just going to go see, thats all; were coming back.Whoever it is, you should yield to them,I need some potion for my leg, it hurts bad.If we see any leg potion, well bring it,Arry, lets go, I want to get near before the sun is  down.Hot Pie, you keep Weasel here, I dont want her following.Last time she kicked me.Ill kick you if you dont keep her here."
1795,Arya,Lommy,I think Lommys going to die.
1796,Gendry,Luwin,Maybe we could find a maester .
1797,Gendry,Luwin,".You only find maesters in castles, and even if we found one, he  wouldnt dirty his hands on the likes of Lommy."
1798,Gendry,Luwin,Thats not true.
1799,Gendry,Luwin,"Hes going to die, and the sooner he does it, the better for the rest of us."
1800,Lommy,Luwin,"If it was you or me hurt, you know hed leave us."
1801,Arya,Lommy,"Im sick of carrying him, and Im sick of all his talk about yielding  too."
1802,Arya,Lommy,"That crying girls no use  either.You leave Weasel alone, shes just scared and hungry is all."
1803,Gendry,Hot,"Shes no use,Her and Hot Pie and Lommy, theyre slowing us down,  and theyre going to get us killed."
1804,Arya,Yoren,Even if you  are a girl.
1805,Arya,Yoren,"Im not a girl!Yes you are.Do you think Im as stupid as they are?No, youre stupider.The Nights Watch doesnt take girls, everyone knows that.Thats true."
1806,Arya,Yoren,Youre still a  girl.I am not!Then pull out your cock and take a piss.Go on.I dont need to take a piss.If I wanted to I could.Liar.
1807,Gendry,Hot,"If youre not a girl, you must be some eunuch.Youre the eunuch.You know Im not."
1808,Arya,Gendry,"You want me to take out my cock and prove it?I dont have  anything to hide.Yes you do,Those gold  cloaks were after you at the inn, and you wont tell us why.I wish I knew."
1809,Arya,Yoren,"Why did you think they were after you,  though?"
1810,Arya,Gendry,"Ill tell you if youll tell me,I would if I knew, Arry ."
1811,Arya,Gendry,"is that really what youre called, or do you have some girls name?"
1812,Arya,Gendry,"Lommy and Hot Pie cant know,They wont,Not from me.Arya."
1813,Arya,Gendry,"My name is Arya.Of House Stark.Of House It took him a moment before he said, The one they killed for a traitor.He was never a traitor.He was my father."
1814,Arya,Gendry,So thats why you thought  She nodded.Yoren was taking me home to Winterfell.I .
1815,Arya,Gendry,.
1816,Mordane,Sansa,"My mothers a lady, and my sister, but I never was.Yes you were."
1817,Arya,Gendry,.
1818,Arya,Gendry,"All that about cocks, I never  should have said that.And I been pissing in front of you and everything, I I beg your pardon, mlady.Stop that!"
1819,Arya,Gendry,"I know my courtesies, mlady,Whenever highborn girls came into the  shop with their fathers, my mastcr told me I was to bend the knee, and speak only when they spoke to    me, and call them mlady.If you start calling me mlady, even Hot Pie is going to notice.And you better keep on pissing the same  way too.As mlady commands."
1820,Arya,Gendry,What  kind of lords daughter are you?
1821,Arya,Gendry,This kind.
1822,Arya,Gendry,You laugh all you like.Im  going to see whos in the village.
1823,Arya,Gendry,You smell that?
1824,Arya,Gendry,Rotten fish?You know its not.We better be careful.
1825,Arya,Gendry,"If you need help, bark like a dog.Thats stupid.If I need help, Ill shout help."
1826,Hot,Weasel,"Quiet,"
1827,Hot,Yoren,We thought you left us.
1828,Arya,Lommy,I was scared you was a wolf.Wheres the Bull?
1829,Arya,Lommy,"They caught him,We have to get him out."
1830,Hot,Lommy,"Well sneak up  and kill the guards, and then Ill open the door."
1831,Arya,Lommy,"How many?I couldnt count,Twenty at least, but only two on the door."
1832,Arya,Lommy,"We cant fight twenty.You only need to fight one.Ill do the other and well get Gendry out and run.We should yield,Just go in and yield."
1833,Arya,Lommy,"Then just leave him, Arry,They dont know  about the rest of us."
1834,Arya,Lommy,"Its not our fault Gendrys captured.Youre stupid, Lommy,Youll die if we dont get Gendry out.Whos going to carry  you?You and Hot Pie.All the time, with no one else to help?"
1835,Gendry,Hot,"Anyhow, I dont  care what you say, Im going back for him."
1836,Hot,Lommy,Are you coming?
1837,Arya,Lommy,"Ill come,Lommy, you keep Weasel here."
1838,Arya,Hot,"What if the wolves come?Yield,"
1839,Arya,Hot,"Just be quiet and follow.Theres dead men hanging on the other side of the hedge, but  theyre nothing to be scared of, just remember fear cuts deeper than swords."
1840,Arya,Hot,Whos there?
1841,Arya,Hot,I yield!
1842,Arya,Hot,"I yield, I yield."
1843,Arya,Jon,"Oho, a fierce one,"
1844,Arya,Sansa,"That one belongs to the Hounds brother,Hes even bigger than Hodor, youll see.They call him the Mountain That  Rides."
1845,Gregor,Hot,"Youll lead us to these others,"
1846,Hot,Lommy,"I yield,"
1847,Arya,Lommy,I yield.Please.
1848,Arya,Lommy,"Are you the last?Baker boy said there was a  girl.She ran off when she heard you coming,You made a lot of noise."
1849,Lommy,Weasel,"Tell us where we can find that whoreson Dondarrion, and therell be a hot meal in it for you.Who?"
1850,Lommy,Weasel,"I told you, this lot dont know no more than those cunts in the village.Waste obloody time."
1851,Lommy,Weasel,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?It got hurt.Can you walk?"
1852,Lommy,Weasel,"No,You got to carry me.Think so?"
1853,Lommy,Tyrion,"Carry him, he says,"
1854,Hallyne,Tyrion,A smooth pot is more apt to slip from a mans grasp.
1855,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Thick,That is from the cold, my lord,"
1856,Hallyne,Tyrion,"As it warms, the substance will flow more easily, like lamp oil."
1857,Thoros,Tyrion,"Water will not quench it, I am told.,,  "
1858,Thoros,Tyrion,"More, it will seep into  cloth, wood, leather, even steel, so they take fire as well."
1859,Aerys,Hallyne,"Why doesnt it seep into the clay as well?Oh, but it does,There is a vault below this one where we store the older pots."
1860,Baelor,Tyrion,  
1861,Chett,Tyrion,"These, ah, fruits of the late King  Aerys, can they still be used?Oh, yes, most certainly ."
1862,Hallyne,Tyrion,  
1863,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Wisdom Malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full ten thousand jars,  as was promised the queen.I concur."
1864,Hallyne,Tyrion,"I trust that  your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste, Wisdom."
1865,Hallyne,Tyrion,"and we most certainly do not want any mishaps.There will be no mishaps, my lord Hand."
1866,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Any fire in the cell below causes the floors to fall away, and the sand smothers  the blaze at once.Not to mention the careless acolyte."
1867,Hallyne,Tyrion,"My brethren are never careless,If I may be, hmmmm, frank  The substance flows through my veins, and lives in the heart of every pyromancer."
1868,Hallyne,Tyrion,"My father often told King Aerys as much,  as his father told old King Jaehaerys.They must have listened,If they had burned the city down, someone would have told me.So your counsel is that we had best be careful? Be very careful,Be very very careful.These clay jars ."
1869,Hallyne,Tyrion,"do you have an ample supply?We do, my lord, and thank you for asking.You wont mind if I take some, then.A few thousand.A few thousand?Or however many your guild can spare, without interfering with production."
1870,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Have them sent round to the captains on each of the city gates.I will, my lord, but why ."
1871,Hallyne,Tyrion,?
1872,Hallyne,Tyrion,"When you tell me to dress warmly, I dress warmly."
1873,Hallyne,Tyrion,.
1874,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Ive seen enough.Perhaps you would be so good as to escort me  back up to my litter?It would be my great, hmmm, pleasure, my lord."
1875,Hallyne,Tyrion,It was good of you to visit us.
1876,Aerys,Jaime,King Aerys took a great interest in our work.
1877,Aerys,Jaime,"Joffrey will be interested as well, I have no doubt."
1878,Aerys,Jaime,It is our great hope to have the king visit our Guildhall in his own royal person.
1879,Aerys,Jaime,.
1880,Jaime,Tyrion,His Grace has prohibited all feasting until such time as the war  is won.
1881,Jaime,Tyrion,"The king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while his people  go without bread.A most, hmmm, loving gesture, my lord."
1882,Joffrey,Tyrion,Many and wondrous are the  things we might show you.I will take it up with my sister.
1883,Bronn,Tyrion,"What are you doing here?Delivering your messages,Ironhand wants you urgently at the Gate of the Gods."
1884,Bronn,Tyrion,And youve been summoned to Maegors too.Summoned?
1885,Bronn,Tyrion,And what does  Cersei want of me?
1886,Bronn,Tyrion,The queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her in her  chambers.
1887,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Four hairs on his lip and he thinks hes a  man.Four hairs and a knighthood.Hes Ser Lancel now, never forget."
1888,Bronn,Cersei,"Id best see what Bywater wants.Inform my sister that  I will attend her on my return.She wont like that,Good."
1889,Timett,Tyrion,I much prefer  angry and stupid to composed and cunning.
1890,Cleos,Jacelyn,"My lord.Your cousin Cleos Frey is here, come from Riverrun  under a peace banner with a letter from Robb Stark.Peace terms?So he says.Sweet cousin.Show me to him."
1891,Cleos,Tyrion,"Tyrion, you are a most welcome sight.Thats not something I hear often, cousin.Has Cersei come with you?My sister is otherwise occupied.Is this Starks letter?"
1892,Cleos,Tyrion,"Ser Jacelyn, you  may leave us."
1893,Cleos,Tyrion,"I was asked to bring the offer to the Queen Regent,I shall."
1894,Cleos,Robb,"All in good time, cousin."
1895,Cleos,Robb,You look gaunt and haggard.
1896,Cleos,Robb,Yes.
1897,Cleos,Robb,"It is bad in the riverlands, Tyrion."
1898,Cleos,Robb,"The river lords are burning their own crops to try and starve us,  and your fathers foragers are torching every village they take and putting the smallfolk to the sword."
1899,Cleos,Tyrion,"Even with a peace banner, we were attacked twice."
1900,Cleos,Tyrion,"Lost three men, and twice as many wounded.What news of our foe?"
1901,Cleos,Tyrion,"The boy sits idle at Riverrun,I think he fears to face your father in the field."
1902,Cleos,Tyrion,"The river lords have departed, each to defend his own lands."
1903,Cleos,Tyrion,These terms will never do.Will you at least consent to trade the Stark girls for Tion and Willem?
1904,Cleos,Tyrion,"No,"
1905,Cersei,Tyrion,We shall send you back to Riverrun  with our terms.
1906,Cersei,Tyrion,"My lord, I do not believe Robb Stark will yield easily.It is  Lady Catelyn who wants this peace, not the boy.Lady Catelyn wants her daughters."
1907,Jacelyn,Tyrion,Ser Jacelyn will see that you have food and fire.
1908,Jacelyn,Tyrion,I will send  for you when we know more.
1909,Robb,Tyrion,"You did well to send for me,I shall leave Ser Cleos in your hands.He is to have every  hospitality.And his escort?"
1910,Robb,Tyrion,"Give them food and clean garb, and find a maester to see to their hurts.They are not to set foot inside  the city, is that understood?"
1911,Robb,Tyrion,"Well understood, my lord.Oh, and one more thing."
1912,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Once they learn to do that without burning themselves, they may be ready for wildfire."
1913,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Wise measures.Though I have no love for that  alchemists piss.Nor I, but I use what Im given."
1914,Aegon,Tyrion,Corruption!
1915,Aegon,Tyrion,There is the warning!Behold the Fathers scourge!
1916,Aegon,Tyrion,"We have become swollen, bloated, foul."
1917,Chett,Tyrion,"When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a  thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!"
1918,Moon,Tyrion,There comes the Harbinger!
1919,Moon,Tyrion,Fire!Fire!
1920,Cersei,Tyrion,How dare you ignore  my summons!Who admitted you to my tower?Your tower?This is my sons royal castle.So they tell me.
1921,Moon,Tyrion,"I was about to come to you, as it happens.Were you?"
1922,Moon,Tyrion,"You doubt me?Always, and with good reason.Im hurt."
1923,Cersei,Myrcella,"If Ive given you offense, I would know how.What a disgusting little worm you are."
1924,Cersei,Myrcella,Did you truly imagine that I would  allow you to sell her like a bag of oats? 
1925,Cersei,Myrcella,Hardly a bag of  oats.
1926,Myrcella,Tyrion,Or did you plan to marry her  to Tommen?
1927,Doran,Tyrion,"Brother or no, I should  have your tongue out for that.I am Joffreys regent, not you, and I say that Myrcella will not be shipped  off to this Dornishman the way I was shipped to Robert Baratheon."
1928,Doran,Tyrion,Why not?Shed be a deal safer in Dorne than she is here.Are you utterly ignorant or simply perverse?You know as well as I that the Martells have no cause to  love us.The Martells have every cause to hate us.
1929,Cersei,Myrcella,"Until such time, she would be an honored guest at Sunspear, under Prince Dorans protection.A hostage,An honored guest,"
1930,Joffrey,Sansa,"With a knight of the  Kingsguard as her sworn shield, no one is like to forget who or what she is.Small good Ser Arys will do her if Doran Martell decides that my daughters death would wash out his  sisters.Martell is too honorable to murder a nine-year-old girl, particularly one as sweet and innocent as  Myrcella."
1931,Cersei,Myrcella,.Too much.
1932,Cersei,Tyrion,"Youve offered too  much, and without my authority or consent.This is the Prince of Dorne we are speaking of.If Id offered less, hed likely spit in my face.Too much!"
1933,Cersei,Tyrion,"What would you have offered him, that hole between your legs?"
1934,Eddard,Tyrion,"Sweet sweet sister,I promise you, that was the last time you will ever strike me."
1935,Eddard,Tyrion,"Dont threaten me, little man."
1936,Eddard,Tyrion,"Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too, for all the good it did him."
1937,Cersei,Tyrion,How safe do you think Myrcella will be if Kings Landing falls?Renly and Stannis will mount her  head beside yours.
1938,Cersei,Tyrion,"Dont touch me,"
1939,Cersei,Tyrion,"Dont look at me, not ."
1940,Cersei,Tyrion,not you.
1941,Jaime,Tyrion,"I did not mean to frighten you.I promise you, nothing will happen to  Myrcella.Liar,Im not a child, to be soothed with empty promises."
1942,Cersei,Jaime,"Well, where is he? In Riverrun, I should imagine.Safe and under guard, until I find a way to free him."
1943,Cersei,Jaime,I should have been born a man.
1944,Jaime,Tyrion,What is he doing?Making war.From behind the walls of Harrenhal?
1945,Jaime,Tyrion,"A curious way of fighting.It looks  suspiciously like hiding.Look again.What else would you call it?Father sits in one castle, and Robb Stark sits in another, and no one does  anything.There is sitting and there is sitting,Each one waits for the other to move, but the lion  is still, poised, his tail twitching, while the fawn is frozen by fear, bowels turned to jelly.No matter which  way he bounds, the lion will have him, and he knows it.And youre quite certain that Father is the lion?"
1946,Jaime,Tyrion,Its on all our banners.
1947,Renly,Tyrion,"If it was Father whod been taken captive, Jaime would not be sitting by idly, I  promise you."
1948,Harren,Renly,"Not all of us can be as bold  as Jaime, but there are other ways to win wars.Harrenhal is strong and well situated.And Kings Landing is not, as we both know perfectly well."
1949,Harren,Renly,He could be at our gates any day now!The city will not fall in a day.
1950,Cersei,Tyrion,it makes a lovely picture.
1951,Cersei,Tyrion,"And if  Robb Stark marches?Harrenhal is close enough to the fords of the Trident so that Roose  Bolton cannot bring the northern foot across to join with the Young Wolfs horse.Stark cannot march on  Kings Landing without taking Harrenhal first, and even with Bolton he is not strong enough to do that."
1952,Cersei,Tyrion,"Meanwhile Father lives off the fat of the riverlands, while our uncle  Stafford gathers fresh levies at the Rock."
1953,Cersei,Tyrion,How could you know all this?Did Father tell you his intentions when  he sent you here?No.I glanced at a map.
1954,Cleos,Tyrion,"Youve conjured up every word of this in that grotesque head of yours,  havent you, Imp?"
1955,Cleos,Tyrion,"Sweet sister, I ask you, if we werent winning, would the Starks have sued for peace?"
1956,Cleos,Tyrion,"The Young Wolf has sent us terms, you see."
1957,Cleos,Tyrion,Would you care to see them? Yes.
1958,Cersei,Tyrion,"How do you come to have them?They should have come to  me.What else is a Hand for, if not to hand you things?"
1959,Bran,Robb,Stark!
1960,Bran,Robb,Winterfell!Winterfell!
1961,Hodor,Rodrik,"I wanted to ride too,I ride better than you.You dont, so hush up,"
1962,Bran,Robb,"May there be a hundred more,A hundred more!"
1963,Luwin,Rodrik,"You did well, Bran,Lord Eddard would have been most proud."
1964,Hodor,Rodrik,"Iron LancesThe Burning of the ShipsThe Bear and the  Maiden Fair,"
1965,Arya,Luwin,"She never will,not Arya,"

1980,Bran,Meera,"My lords of Stark,The years have passed in their hundreds and their thousands since my  folk first swore their fealty to the King in the North.My lord father has sent us here to say the words  again, for all our people."
1981,Bran,Meera,"My brother Robb is fighting in the  south,but you can say your words to me, if you like.To Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater,Hearth and heart and harvest we  yield up to you, my lord."
1982,Bran,Meera,"Grant mercy to our  weak, help to our helpless, and justice to all, and we shall never fail you.I swear it by earth and water,I swear it by bronze and iron,We swear it by ice and fire,"
1983,Bran,Meera,"May your winters be  short and your summers bountiful,"

1986,Bran,Meera,I offer you the meat and mead  of Winterfell.
1987,Jojen,Rickon,"Where are the direwolves?In the godswood,Shaggy was bad.My brother would like to see them,"

1994,Bran,Hodor,"Leave them be, Hodor,Take me to my bedchamber."
1995,Bran,Hodor,"You can go back to the feast now, but dont go bothering Joseth and that woman,Hodor,"
1996,Bran,Eddard,"No longer,but once they were a marvel, a shining lesson to the world.Was there one who was best of all?The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with  a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star.They called him the Sword of the Morning,  and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed."
1997,Chett,Meera,"Here they come,"
1998,Chett,Meera,"Did you know they would be so big?They will be bigger still before they are grown,The black one is full of fear and rage, but the grey is strong ."
1999,Catelyn,Meera,"can you feel him, sister?No,Go careful, Joien.He wont hurt me.This is not the day I die."
2000,Catelyn,Wendel,"My lady,There are birds in this grass.Would you fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning?Oats and bread are sufficient ."
2001,Catelyn,Wendel,"We have many leagues yet to ride, Ser Wendel.As you will, my lady."
2002,Catelyn,Wendel,"Oats and bread, and what could be better?"
2003,Catelyn,Robb,"Found some nettles and brewed a tea,Will mlady take a cup?Yes, with thanks."
2004,Catelyn,Robb,"When last I saw Renly,  he was a boy no older than Bran."
2005,Brynden,Robb,"My place is here with my  father, for whatever time he has left."
2006,Brynden,Robb,There is no one else.
2007,Brynden,Robb,  
2008,Brynden,Robb,I cannot sit at Riverrun waiting for peace.
2009,Lysa,Robb,Even my  northmen grow restless.
2010,Lysa,Robb,"No one has ever died of restlessness,  but rashness is another matter.Weve planted seeds, let them grow."
2011,Lysa,Robb,"Weve tossed some seeds in the wind, thats all."
2012,Lysa,Robb,"I  want peace too, but why should the Lannisters give me anything if all I do is sit here while my army melts  away around me swift as summer snow?So rather than look craven, you will dance to Lord Tywins pipes?"
2013,Lysa,Robb,"He wants you to  march on Harrenhal, ask your uncle Brynden if-I said nothing of Harrenhal,Now, will you go to Renly for me, or must I send the  Greatjon?"
2014,Catelyn,Lysa,"Minisa,"
2015,Catelyn,Lysa,.
2016,Catelyn,Lysa,"Wait for me, my lord,I waited for  you, oh, so many times.Now you must wait for me."
2017,Rickon,Wendel,"We ought to reach the upper Mander today, my lady,Lord Renly will not be far, if the talk be true."
2018,Renly,Robb,It is  time we were away.
2019,Catelyn,Renly,"My lady,I am Ser Colen of Greenpools, as it please you. she answered him. Ser Colen  answered, though courteously enough."
2020,Catelyn,Wendel,"This is a  fearsome lot of men,That it is,"
2021,Catelyn,Hallis,"My lady, do you hear that noise?"
2022,Catelyn,Hallis,What is that?
2023,Catelyn,Hallis,"Cheering,"
2024,Chett,Wendel,"A tourney,"
2025,Catelyn,Wendel,"Oh, splendid,"
2026,Catelyn,Wendel,"Lady Stark,if your men  would be so good as to wait here, Ill present you to the king.As you say."
2027,Catelyn,Renly,"Red Ronnets down, gods be damned,Lorasll do for that blue-"
2028,Catelyn,Loras,Loras!
2029,Catelyn,Loras,Loras!Highgarden!
2030,Chett,Loras,Highgarden!
2031,Renly,Robb,"Approach,"
2032,Catelyn,Renly,Tarth!
2033,Catelyn,Renly,A Beauty!
2034,Catelyn,Renly,"Grace,You are all your lord father claimed you were."
2035,Catelyn,Renly,Ive seen Ser  Loras unhorsed once or twice .
2036,Catelyn,Renly,"but never quite in that fashion.That were no proper unhorsing,A vile trick, pulling the lad down."
2037,Catelyn,Renly,"Ser Colen,who is this man, and why do  they mislike him so?"
2038,Catelyn,Renly,"Because he is no man, my lady.Thats Brienne of Tarth, daughter to Lord Selwyn  the Evenstar.Daughter?"
2039,Catelyn,Renly,"Brienne the Beauty, they name her ."
2040,Catelyn,Renly,"though not to her face, lest they be called upon to defend those  words with their bodies."
2041,Brienne,Renly,"As champion, you may ask of me any boon that you  desire.If it lies in my power, it is yours.Your Grace,I ask the honor of a place among your Rainbow Guard. he said."
2042,Chett,Jacelyn,"My life for yours, Your Grace."
2043,Catelyn,Renly,Your Grace!
2044,Catelyn,Renly,I beg your  leave.
2045,Catelyn,Renly,"I have the honor to bring you the Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as envoy by  her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.Lord of Winterfell and King in the North, ser,"
2046,Catelyn,Renly,Lady Catelyn?We are most pleased.
2047,Catelyn,Renly,"Margaery my sweet, this is the Lady Catelyn Stark of Winterfell.You are most welcome here, Lady Stark,I am sorry for your loss.You are kind,My lady, I swear to you, I will see that the Lannisters answer for your husbands murder,When I take Kings Landing, Ill send you Cerseis head."
2048,Blue,Brienne,"it will be enough to know that justice has been  done, my lord.Your Grace,And you should kneel when you approach the king.The distance between a lord and a grace is a small one, my lady,Lord Renly wears a  crown, as does my son.If you wish, we may stand here in the mud and debate what honors and titles are  rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters to consider."
2049,Catelyn,Renly,"Well said, my lady."
2050,Catelyn,Robb,"Tell me, when does your son mean to march against  Harrenhal? "
2051,Mathis,Robb,"I do not sit on my sons war councils, my lord.So long as he leaves a few Lannisters for me, Ill not complain.What has he done with the Kingslayer?Jaime Lannister is held prisoner at Riverrun.Still alive?"
2052,Randyll,Renly,"It would seem the direwolf is gentler than the lion.Gentler than the Lannisters,is drier than the sea.I call it weak."
2053,Randyll,Renly,"No  disrespect to you, Lady Stark, but it would have been more seemly had Lord Robb come to pay homage  to the king himself, rather than hiding behind his mothers skirts.King Robb is warring, my lord,not playing at tourney."
2054,Catelyn,Renly,"Go softly, Lord Randyll, I fear youre overmatched."
2055,Catelyn,Renly,"Find a place for the ladys companions, and see that they have every comfort."
2056,Margaery,Renly,"I fear his lordship is eager  to see the heels of my hungry horde.Not true, Your Grace,What is mine is  yours.Whenever someone said that to my brother Robert, he took them at their word,Do you  have daughters?Yes, Your Grace.Two.Then thank the gods that I am not Robert.My sweet queen is all the woman I desire."
2057,Margaery,Renly,"Well talk again when youve had a chance to refresh yourself,  Lady Catelyn."
2058,Catelyn,Renly,"If you have need of anything, you have only to ask, my lady."
2059,Renly,Rowan,"Why, Your Grace, Im the Kinslayer,Its Kingslayer, fool of a fool,"
2060,Renly,Rowan,"They are all so young,"
2061,Eddard,Robert,"War will make them old,as it did us."
2062,Aerys,Rowan,I  pity them.Why?
2063,Aerys,Rowan,Look at them.
2064,Brienne,Catelyn,"Why pity?Because it will not last,Because they are the knights of summer, and winter  is coming.Lady Catelyn, you are wrong."
2065,Brienne,Catelyn,Winter will never  come for the likes of us.
2066,Catelyn,Eddard,"In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining."
2067,Catelyn,Renly,"Lady Catelyn,I feel the need of some air.Will you walk with  me?"
2068,Brienne,Catelyn,I should be honored.
2069,Brienne,Renly,"Your Grace, give me but a moment to don my mail.You should not be  without protection."
2070,Brienne,Renly,"If I am not safe in the heart of Lord Caswells castle, with my own host around me,  one sword will make no matter ."
2071,Brienne,Renly,"If I have need of you, Ill    send for you."
2072,Brienne,Renly,"As you will,  Your Grace."
2073,Catelyn,Renly,"This way, my lady."
2074,Brienne,Renly,"Perchance, is Ser Barristan Selmy with your son at Riverrun?No,Is he no longer with Joffrey?He was the Lord Commander of the  Kingsguard."
2075,Brienne,Renly,The Lannisters told him he was too old and gave his cloak to the Hound.
2076,Brienne,Renly,"When he did not turn up  at Highgarden, I thought perhaps he had gone to Riverrun instead.We have not seen him.He was old, yes, but a good man still."
2077,Brienne,Renly,The Lannisters are great fools.
2078,Eddard,Renly,"On the night of Roberts death, I offered your husband a hundred  swords and urged him to take Joffrey into his power.Had he listened, he would  be regent today, and there would have been no need for me to claim the throne.Eddard refused you."
2079,Eddard,Renly,"He had sworn to protect Roberts children,I lacked the strength to act alone, so when  Lord Eddard turned me away, I had no choice but to flee.Had I stayed, I knew the queen would see to  it that I did not long outlive my brother."
2080,Catelyn,Robert,"I liked your husband well enough, my lady."
2081,Renly,Robert,"Here, I wish to show you something."
2082,Catelyn,Renly,"Count them if you like, my lady,You will still be counting when dawn breaks in the east.How many fires burn around  Riverrun tonight, I wonder?"
2083,Catelyn,Renly,"Im told your son crossed the Neck with twenty thousand swords at his back,Now  that the lords of the Trident are with him, perhaps he commands forty thousand."
2084,Mace,Renly,"I have twice that number here,"
2085,Catelyn,Renly,"And never forget my brother Stannis, who holds  Dragonstone and commands the lords of the narrow sea.It would seem that you are the one who has forgotten Stannis,His claim, you mean?"
2086,Renly,Stannis,"Let us be blunt, my lady."
2087,Renly,Stannis,"Men respect Stannis, even fear him, but precious few have ever loved  him.He is still your elder brother.If either of you can be said to have a right to the Iron Throne, it must be  Lord Stannis."
2088,Renly,Stannis,"Tell me, what right did my brother Robert ever have  to the Iron Throne?"
2089,Renly,Stannis,"Oh, there was talk of the blood ties between  Baratheon and Targaryen, of weddings a hundred years past, of second sons and elder daughters."
2090,Renly,Robert,Robert won the throne with his warhammer.
2091,Renly,Robert,"Well, there is my claim, as good as Roberts  ever was."
2092,Aegon,Renly,"those I must have.And if he will not give them to you, my lord?I mean to be king, my lady, and not of a broken kingdom."
2093,Chett,Jacelyn,"  Renly broke off suddenly, distracted."
2094,Cortnay,Renly,Summon the king!
2095,Cortnay,Renly,"Im here, ser.Your Grace."
2096,Cortnay,Renly,I came swift as I could.
2097,Cortnay,Stannis,.But .
2098,Cortnay,Stannis,"I would have been told if Lord Tywin left Harrenhal.These are no Larmisters, my liege."
2099,Cortnay,Stannis,"King Stannis, he calls himself now."
2100,Craster,Jon,"Buckwells horn,The gods are good; Crasters still there.Corn,"
2101,Craster,Small,"The  mans half-mad, I wont deny it,"
2102,Dywen,Mance,Hell give us good counsel.
2103,Craster,Dywen,"And  worse,Theres a cold smell to that one, there  is.Jon,"
2104,Craster,Jon,"The men are to mind their hands and speak to these  women as little as need be.Aye, my lord."
2105,Craster,Jon,You put a fox in with them?
2106,Craster,Jon,"Oh, hullo, Jon.No, they just hate the rain, the  same as us.How are you faring, SamwellWetly."
2107,Craster,Samwell,"Nothing has killed me yet, though.Good."
2108,Craster,Samwell,"If the gods are good, hell let us sleep by his fire."
2109,Craster,Samwell,Dolorous Edd says Crasters a terrible savage.
2110,Jon,Samwell,"A bastard,You can say it, Samwell Ive heard the word before."
2111,Jon,Samwell,I need to hunt down Ser Ottyn.Be careful around Crasters women.
2112,Jon,Samwell,"Well talk later, after weve made camp."
2113,Jon,Ottyn,"Welcome tidings,This wet has soaked my bones, and  even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores."
2114,Dywen,Grenn,"Ghost,Ghost, to me."
2115,Dywen,Grenn,"Ah, its you, Lord Snow."
2116,Dywen,Jon,Thought me and the boy had us one o them Others to deal with.Lose your wolf?Hes off hunting.
2117,Dywen,Grenn,"Fishing, Id call it, in this wet,My mother always said rain was good for growing crops,Aye, a good crop of mildew,The best thing about a rain like this, it saves a man from  taking baths."
2118,Dywen,Jon,"Buckwells found Craster,Had he lost him?"
2119,Dywen,Jon,"See that you young bucks dont go nosing about Crasters wives,  you hear?"
2120,Dywen,Jon,"Want them all for yourself, Dywen?"
2121,Craster,Dywen,Might be I do.
2122,Craster,Grenn,"Hed never miss a couple.How many wives does he have, truly?"
2123,Craster,Grenn,"Moren you ever will, brother."
2124,Grenn,Jon,"Theres your beast,  Snow."
2125,Craster,Jon,"With me, Ghost."
2126,Craster,Jon,"Lord Mormonts in the hall,He said for you to join  him."
2127,Craster,Jon,"If  its warm and dry inside, dont tell me, I wasnt asked in."
2128,Craster,Jon,Does this mud look like shit to you?Could it be that this whole hill is made of Crasters shit?
2129,Craster,Jon,"Well, I hear hes been here a long time,You cheer me not."
2130,Craster,Nan,"Ive not seen Benjen Stark for three years,And if truth be told, I never once  missed him."
2131,Small,Thoren,"He ought to have passed here last year,"
2132,Small,Thoren,"Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce, whod vanished with Gared and young  Will.Aye, those three I recall."
2133,Craster,Gared,My wives give him big  cow eyes all the same.
2134,Craster,Gared,Gared says they were chasing  raiders.
2135,Craster,Jon,"The bite took em, same as mine."
2136,Craster,Jon,Now I hear he got  no head neither.The bite do that too?
2137,Craster,Robb,"When Ser Waymar left you, where was he bound?"
2138,Craster,Robb,Happens I have better things to do than tend to the comings and goings of  crows.
2139,Craster,Robb,Had no good southron wine up here for a bears  night.
2140,Craster,Robb,"Mines lost its bite, cant have that, I got me women to  protect."
2141,Craster,Robb,"You are few here, and isolated,If you like, Ill detail some men to escort you south to  the Wall."
2142,Craster,Robb,"Wall,"
2143,Craster,Robb,"And what would we do there,  serve you at supper?"
2144,Craster,Robb,Craster serves no man.These are bad times to dwell alone in the wild.The cold winds are rising.Let them rise.My roots are sunk deep.
2145,Chett,Craster,"Tell him, wife.Tell the Lord Crow how well content we are."
2146,Chett,Craster,This is our place.
2147,Chett,Craster,"Better to die free than live a  slave.Slave,"
2148,Chett,Craster,Every village we have passed has been abandoned.
2149,Chett,Craster,"One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me, which tells me that they remember some  of what they knew when they lived, but there was no human mercy left in them."
2150,Chett,Craster,Weve had no such troubles here .
2151,Chett,Craster,"Though I could use me a sharp new axe.More beer, and be quick about it.No trouble from the dead,but what of the living, my lord?"
2152,Chett,Craster,"King, king, king.That Mance Rayder?"
2153,Chett,Craster,King-beyond-theWall.What do free folk want with  kings?
2154,Chett,Craster,"Theres much I could tell you o Rayder and his doings, if I  had a mind."
2155,Craster,Thoren,Its nailed to that wall there.
2156,Craster,Thoren,Might be that I could tell you where to seek Mance Rayder.If I had a mind.
2157,Craster,Thoren,"But well have time enough for that.Youll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, belike, and eat me out    of pigs.A roof would be most welcome, my lord,Weve had hard riding, and too much wet.Then youll guest here for a night."
2158,Craster,Thoren,"The rest o your black crows  can peck after their own corn.Weve packed in our own supplies, my lord,We should be pleased to share our  food and wine."
2159,Small,Thoren,"Ill taste your wine, Lord Crow, that I  will."
2160,Small,Thoren,"Any man lays a hand on my wives, he loses the hand.Your roof, your rule,Thats settled, then."
2161,Craster,Small,Dya have a man can draw a map?SamwellTarly can.
2162,Craster,Small,Samwellloves maps.
2163,Craster,Jon,Send him here after hes eaten.
2164,Craster,Jon,A guest gift for our host.Whos this one now?
2165,Craster,Jon,"He has the look of a Stark.My steward and squire, Jon Snow.A bastard, is it?"
2166,Craster,Jon,"Man wants to bed  a woman, seems like he ought to take her to wife.Thats what I do."
2167,Jon,Ottyn,"Well, run and do your service, bastard, and see that axe is good and sharp now, Ive no use for dull  steel."
2168,Jon,Ottyn,"Give the wildling an axe, why not?"
2169,Jon,Ottyn,"Hell give it back,  I vow."
2170,Chett,Jon,Perhaps Craster would like a nice hat instead.
2171,Jon,Scar,"He wants an axe.And wine as well.See, the Old Bears clever."
2172,Jon,Scar,I have two ears but only one head.Smallwood says Craster is a friend to the Watch.Do you know the difference between a wildling whos a friend to the Watch and one whos not?
2173,Jon,Scar,Our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves.
2174,Jon,Scar,"I wonder how long that bears been nailed up on that gate, and what Craster had there  before we came hallooing?"
2175,Jon,Scar,"Is it  dry in there?Drier than out here.If I lurk about after, not too close to the fire, belike theyll take no note of me till morn.The ones under  his roof will be the first he murders, but at least well die dry."
2176,Jon,Scar,Crasters one man.
2177,Jon,Scar,"I doubt hell murder anyone.You cheer me,And besides, theres much to be said for a good  sharp axe."
2178,Jon,Scar,Its good that were not giving them mauls.
2179,Craster,Samwell,Wolf!
2180,Craster,Samwell,"Keep  away,You keep  away! "
2181,Craster,Samwell,"Get it away, mlord,He wont hurt you."
2182,Craster,Samwell,He must have been hungry.We havent seen much game.
2183,Jon,Lark,Are  you one of Crasters daughters?
2184,Jon,Lark,Wife now.
2185,Jon,Lark,I was going to breed them rabbits.Theres no sheep left.The Watch will make good for them.
2186,Jon,Lark,Ill speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow.
2187,Chett,Lark,MIord-Im no lord.
2188,Chett,Lark,"Dont you believe him, girl,Thats Lord Snow  himself.Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings,That wolfs looking at you hungry, girl,Might be it fancies that tender bit in your belly."
2189,Chett,Jon,"Youre scaring her.Warning her, more like."
2190,Chett,Jon,"Were not to talk to you,Wait,"
2191,Chett,Jon,"There was no call to scare the girl,Well hear no scolds from you, bastard."
2192,Jon,Lark,"You may be the Lord  Commanders pet, but youre not the Lord Commander ."
2193,Jon,Lark,"and you wouldnt talk so bloody bold  without that monster of yours always about.Ill not fight a brother while were beyond the Wall,"
2194,Jon,Lark,"Hes afraid of you, Chett.On the Sisters, we have a name for them like him.I know all the names.Save your breath."
2195,Jon,Samwell,"How dye like my castle, Lord Snow?It looks snug.You know where Samwellis?Keep on the way you were.If you come on Ser Ottyns pavilion, youve gone too far."
2196,Jon,Samwell,Unless Sams found him a tree too.What a tree that would be.
2197,Jon,Samwell,"My feet are soaked through,When I climbed  off my horse, I stepped in a hole and went in up to my knees.Take off your boots and dry your stockings."
2198,Jon,Samwell,"If the grounds not wet under the  rock, we might be able to get a fire burning."
2199,Jon,Samwell,"And well feast.Wont you be attending Lord Mormont in the hall?No, but you will."
2200,Craster,Samwell,Craster says hell find Mance Rayder for us.Oh.
2201,Craster,Jon,"He said eat first, though.Dry your feet."
2202,Jon,Samwell,"I think theres moss growing between my toes,The rabbit will taste good.I dont even mind  about the blood and all."
2203,Jon,Samwell,"Well, only a little ."
2204,Jon,Samwell,.
2205,Jon,Samwell,"You had  yours before,Is Craster as savage as the rangers say?"
2206,Jon,Samwell,Whats his castle like?A midden heap with a roof and a firepit.
2207,Craster,Samwell,"That was good,  but now Id like a leg of lamb."
2208,Craster,Samwell,"Did you  see any lambs?There was a sheepfold, but no sheep.How does he feed all his men?I didnt see any men."
2209,Craster,Samwell,Can you find the way?If I dont fall in the mud.
2210,Arya,Sansa,Lord Snow?
2211,Jon,Robb,"The fat one told me Id find you here, mlord,We ate the rabbit, if thats what you came for."
2212,Jon,Robb,"Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits."
2213,Jon,Robb,"Is it true, mlord?Are you brother to a king?A half brother,Im Eddard Starks bastard."
2214,Jon,Robb,"Why  are you here?The fat one, that Samwell he said to see you.He give me his cloak, so no one would say I didnt belong.Wont Craster be angry with you?My father drank overmuch of the Lord Crows wine last night.Hell sleep most of the day."
2215,Jon,Robb,They say the king gives justice and protects the weak.
2216,Jon,Robb,"Mlord, I beg you-"
2217,Jon,Sansa,"We were commanded not to  speak to Crasters women.You dont have to speak with me, mlord.just take me with you, when you go, thats all I ask."
2218,Jon,Sansa,Ill .
2219,Jon,Sansa,"My father, hes got nineteen now, one less wont hurt him none.Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, dont you know that?And were guests in your fathers  hall besides.Not you,I watched."
2220,Jon,Sansa,"Its for the baby I have to go.I dont even know your name.Gilly, he called me.For the gillyflower.Thats pretty."
2221,Jon,Sansa,"Is it Craster who  frightens you, Gilly?For the baby, not for me."
2222,Craster,Jon,What gods?
2223,Craster,Jon,"The cold gods,The ones in the night.The white shadows."
2224,Craster,Mance,What color are their eyes?
2225,Craster,Mance,"Blue.As bright as blue stars, and as cold."
2226,Craster,Mance,Will you take me?  
2227,Gilly,Mance,Your babe would not be safe with us.
2228,Gilly,Mance,"You will come back, though.When your warrings done, youll pass this  way again.We may."
2229,Gilly,Mance,"Thats for the Old Bear to say, the one you call the Lord Crow."
2230,Gilly,Mance,I do not choose the road I ride.No.
2231,Gilly,Jon,"Sorry to be of trouble, mlord."
2232,Jon,Samwell,.
2233,Craster,Grenn,"You did not,I would have seen."
2234,Aemon,Dywen,You?
2235,Aemon,Dywen,"You never even saw that bear.What bear?Was there a bear?Theres always a bear,One killed my  brother when I was young."
2236,Aemon,Jon,Ive had nothing but trouble with my teeth.Did Samwellsleep in the hall last night?
2237,Aemon,Jon,Id not call it sleeping.
2238,Jarman,Jon,"Gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me.Id best go see to Lord Mormont,"
2239,Craster,Jarman,"Jon,Keep a good edge on that bastard sword of yours.Well be needing it soon  enough."
2240,Craster,Jon,Corn?
2241,Craster,Jon,"Ignore that wretched beggar bird, Jon, its just had half my bacon."
2242,Craster,Jon,"What sort of day do we have? Cold, but the rain has stopped.Very good."
2243,Jon,Samwell,"Craster serves plain fare, but filling."
2244,Jon,Samwell,"I broke my fast with the men, my lord."
2245,Gilly,Samwell,"You  might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me,"
2246,Jon,Samwell,I  thought you would help her.And how was I to do that?
2247,Jon,Samwell,"Take her with us, wrapped up in your cloak?   said Samwellguiltily, "
2248,Jon,Samwell,.
2249,Jon,Samwell,What?That wed take her with us?
2250,Jon,Samwell,On the way home.
2251,Grenn,Jon,Shes going to  have a baby.Samwell have you taken leave of all your sense?
2252,Grenn,Jon,"And if we do, do you  think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Crasters wives?I thought ."
2253,Grenn,Jon,"I have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle."
2254,Craster,Jon,"My lord,Craster has no sheep.Nor  any sons."
2255,Craster,Jon,"At Winterfell one of the serving women told us stories,She used to say that there were  wildlings who would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.Hearth tales.Does Craster seem less than human to you?"
2256,Craster,Jon,He gives his sons to the wood.
2257,Craster,Jon,"Yes.Yes,Yes, yes, yes.You knew?Smallwood told me."
2258,Craster,Jon,"All the rangers know, though few will talk of it.Did my uncle know?All the rangers,You think I ought to stop him.Kill him if need be."
2259,Craster,Jon,"Were it only that he wished to rid himself of some mouths, Id gladly send Yoren or Conwys to  collect the boys."
2260,Craster,Jon,"His prayers, if you  will."
2261,Craster,Jon,How is it you came to know this?
2262,Craster,Jon,"From one of Crasters wives?Yes, my lord,I would sooner not tell you which.She was frightened and wanted  help.The wide world is full of people wanting help, Jon."
2263,Gilly,Jon,"Were it me, Id name it Answered Prayer and make an end."
2264,Craster,Jon,Yet it would be an ill day for us if Craster died.Your uncle could tell you of the times Crasters Keep  made the difference between life and death for our rangers.My father .
2265,Craster,Jon,.
2266,Craster,Jon,"Go on, Jon.Say what you would say.My father once told me that some men are not worth having,A bannerman who is brutal  or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself.Craster is his own man."
2267,Jon,Mance,The Nights  Watch has other wars to fight.
2268,Jon,Mance,Jarman Buckwell said I might have need of my sword soon.Did he?
2269,Jon,Mance,"Craster said much and more last night, and confirmed  enough of my fears to condemn me to a sleepless night on his floor."
2270,Jon,Mance,"It is the same tale that Ser Denys  Mallister had from the wildling his men captured in the Gorge, but Craster has added the where, and that  makes all the difference.Is he making a city, or an army?Now, that is the question."
2271,Jon,Nan,"Mance Rayder    means to strike south, into the Seven Kingdoms.Wildlings have invaded the realm before."
2272,Luwin,Nan,"Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfathers grandfather,  and before him there was a king named Bael the Bard.Aye, and long before them came the Horned Lord and the brother kings Gendel and Gorne, and in  ancient days Joramun, who blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth."
2273,Jon,Mance,"but he has eyes to see, and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart.What will we do?"
2274,Jon,Mance,"Find him,Fight him.Stop him."
2275,Jon,Theon,"Now theres a pretty grin,The lordling likes the look of her, does  he?"
2276,Chett,Theon,"Yes, shes a sweet sight,though not half so sweet as you.Oho."
2277,Chett,Theon,"Id best be careful.This lordling has a honeyed tongue.Taste it and see.Is it that way, then?"
2278,Chett,Theon,"Have you been that long at sea, lordling?Or were there no women where  you came from?Women enough, but none like you.And how would you know what Im like?My eyes can see your face."
2279,Chett,Theon,And my cocks gone hard as a mast for  you.
2280,Chett,Theon,"Well, youre no liar,How bad does it hurt?Fiercely.Poor lordling."
2281,Chett,Theon,"As it happens, Im a woman wed, and new with  child.The gods are good,No chance Id give you a bastard that way.Even so, my man wouldnt thank you.No, but you might.And why would that be?"
2282,Chett,Theon,Theyre made the same as other men.Have you ever had a prince?
2283,Chett,Theon,"When youre wrinkled and grey and your teats hang past  your belly, you can tell your childrens children that once you loved a king.Oh, is it love were talking now?And here I thought it was just cocks and cunts.Is it love you fancy?"
2284,Aeron,Theon,"Shall I name my longship after you, and play you the  high harp, and keep you in a tower room in my castle with only jewels to wear, like a princess in a song?You ought to name your ship after me,It was me who built her.Sigrin built her.My lord fathers shipwright.Im Esgred.Ambrodes daughter, and wife to Sigrin."
2285,Aeron,Theon,Youre wasted on Sigrin.Oho.Sigrin told me this sweet ship is wasted on you.
2286,Aeron,Theon,Do you know who I am?Prince Theon of House Greyjoy.
2287,Aeron,Theon,Sigrin will want to know.
2288,Balon,Victarion,"Sigrin did me good service,Is she as fast as she looks?Faster-for a master that knows how to handle her.It has been a few years since I sailed a ship."
2289,Balon,Victarion,"Still, Im a  Greyjoy, and an ironman.The sea is in my blood.And your blood will be in the sea, if you sail the way you talk,I would never mistreat such a fair maiden.Fair maiden?"
2290,Balon,Victarion,"Shes a sea bitch, this one.There, and now youve named her.Sea Bitch."
2291,Chett,Jacelyn,"And you said youd name her after me,I did."
2292,Balon,Chett,"Help me, my lady.in the green lands, they believe a woman with child  means good fortune for any man who beds her.And what would they know about ships in the green lands?"
2293,Balon,Chett,"Besides, I think  you made that up.If I confess, will you still love me?Still?When have I ever loved you?Never,"
2294,Balon,Chett,"On the morrow my uncle Aeron will pour seawater over her prow  and mumble a prayer to the Drowned God, but Id sooner bless her with the milk of my loins, and yours.The Drowned God might not take that kindly.Bugger the Drowned God."
2295,Balon,Theon,Would you send me into battle all sleepless with longing?Gladly.A cruel maid.
2296,Balon,Theon,"If I steer her onto the rocks in my distraction, youll have yourself  to blame.Do you plan to steer with this?"
2297,Balon,Theon,"Come back to Pyke with me,"
2298,Balon,Theon,And what would I do in Pyke?
2299,Balon,Theon,My father will feast his captains tonight.
2300,Balon,Theon,"Would you make me your captain for the night, my lord prince?"
2301,Balon,Theon,"I might.If I knew youd steer me safe into port.Well, I know which end of the oar goes in the sea, and theres no one better with ropes and knots."
2302,Balon,Theon,"A  pity Im a woman wed, and new with child."
2303,Chett,Theon,"I need to start back to the castle.if you do not come with me,  I may lose my way for grief, and all the islands would be poorer.We couldnt have that ."
2304,Chett,Theon,"but I have no horse, my lord.You could take my squires mount.And leave your poor squire to walk all the way to Pyke?Share mine, then.Youd like that well enough."
2305,Chett,Theon,"Now, would I be behind you, or in front?You would be wherever you liked.I like to be on top."
2306,Chett,Theon,My fathers hall is dim and dank.It needs Esgred to make the  fires blaze.The lordling has a honeyed tongue.Isnt that where we began?
2307,Chett,Theon,And where we end.
2308,Chett,Theon,Let me see your proud towers rising from the sea.I left my horse at the inn.Come.
2309,Qarl,Theon,Has my lord prince begun choosing his crew?
2310,Qarl,Theon,"Ho, Bluetooth,How fares your bride?Fat with child, and talking of twins.So soon?"
2311,Qarl,Theon,"You got your oar in the water quickly.Aye, and stroked and stroked and stroked,A big man,Bluetooth, was it?Should I choose him for my Sea Bitch?Only if you mean to insult him.Bluetooth has a sweet ship of his own.I have been too long away to know one man from another,"
2312,Qarl,Theon,"My uncle  Victarion has loaned me his own steersman.Rymolf Stormdrunk?A good man, so long as hes sober.Uller, Qarl. replied the stocky man with the white streak in his  beard. said the pink-cheeked youth  beside him. Esgred said."
2313,Qarl,Theon,"You seem well known,Every man loves the shipwrights wife."
2314,Balon,Theon,"If you need men to  pull your oars, you could do worse than those three.Lordsport has no lack of strong arms."
2315,Balon,Theon,Strength is not enough.
2316,Balon,Theon,"Choose  men who have rowed together before, if youre wise.Sage counsel.Perhaps youd help me choose them."
2317,Balon,Theon,I may.If you treat me kindly.How else?
2318,Balon,Theon,"Milord,"
2319,Theon,Wex,"Milord, a moment,As it please milord ."
2320,Theon,Wex,.Did she?
2321,Theon,Wex,Please milord?
2322,Theon,Wex,For a time.Now she wants to be my salt wife.Oho.
2323,Theon,Wex,Or am I wrong?Youre not wrong.
2324,Theon,Wex,"Wex, - he  shouted over the din and clatter."
2325,Theon,Wex,"Time to go,"
2326,Balon,Theon,"Esgred will be riding with me back to Pyke.Saddle the horses, and be quick about it."
2327,Balon,Theon,Where did you find that hellhorse?
2328,Balon,Theon,"Lord Botley bought him in Lannisport a year past, but he proved to be too much horse for him, so  Botley was pleased to sell."
2329,Aeron,Theon,Does he have a name?
2330,Aeron,Theon,Smiler.
2331,Aeron,Theon,I knew a man once who told me that I smiled at the wrong things.Do you?Only by the lights of those who smile at nothing.
2332,Aeron,Theon,"Are you smiling now, my lord prince?Oh, yes."
2333,Aeron,Theon,"Id keep both hands on the reins, or this black beast of yours is like to fling us both off  and kick us to death.I broke him of that."
2334,Asha,Theon,"You dont want to do that, my lord prince.Oh, but I do."
2335,Asha,Theon,"Your squire is watching you.Let him.Hell never speak of it, I swear."
2336,Asha,Theon,I like a woman with a good tight grip.
2337,Asha,Theon,"Id not have thought it, by that wench on the waterfront.You must not judge me by her.She was the only woman on the ship.Tell me of your father.Will he welcome me kindly to his castle?Why should he?He scarcely welcomed me, his own blood, the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.Are you?"
2338,Asha,Theon,"Its said that you have uncles, brothers, a sister.My brothers are long dead, and my sister ."
2339,Asha,Theon,"As I recall, she had a nose like a vultures beak, a ripe crop of pimples, and no more  chest than a boy.You can marry off your sister,but not your uncles.My uncles Theons claim took precedence over those of his fathers three brothers, but the woman had  touched on a sore point nonetheless."
2340,Theon,Victarion,"My uncles pose no threat  to me,Aeron is drunk on seawater and sanctity.  Not yours?Mine as well.What is dead can never die."
2341,Theon,Victarion,"If I make pious noises as required,  Damphair will give me no trouble.  I have heard them sing of him in the alehouses.During my lord fathers rebellion, he sailed into Lannisport with my uncle Euron and burned the  Larmister fleet where it lay at anchor,The plan was Eurons, though."
2342,Balon,Theon,"He has neither the wits nor the ambition to plot  betrayal.Euron Croweye has no lack of cunning, though.Ive heard men say terrible things of that one."
2343,Balon,Theon,My uncle Euron has not been seen in the islands for close on two years.He may  be dead.
2344,Balon,Theon,"He may be dead,and if he lives, why, he has spent so long at sea, hed be half a  stranger here."
2345,Chett,Theon,"I will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke, and see that you have an honored  place at the feast,I must sit on the dais, at my fathers right hand, but I will come down and join  you when he leaves the hall."
2346,Chett,Theon,He has no belly for drink these days.A grievous thing when a great man grows old.Lord Balon is but the father of a great man.A modest lordling.Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him.
2347,Chett,Theon,What shall I wear to this great feast?
2348,Chett,Theon,Ill ask Helya to garb you.
2349,Chett,Theon,"She is off on Harlaw, and not  expected to return.The cold winds have worn her away, I hear."
2350,Chett,Theon,"Harlaw is only a days sail, and  surely Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son.Would that I could."
2351,Chett,Theon,"Your coming might bring her peace.Now you sound a woman,I confess, I am ."
2352,Chett,Theon,and new with child.
2353,Chett,Theon,"So you say, but your body shows no signs of it."
2354,Chett,Theon,"Before I believe you, I shall need to see your breasts grow ripe, and taste your mothers milk.And what will my husband say to this?Your fathers own sworn man and servant?Well give him so many ships to build, hell never know youve left him."
2355,Chett,Theon,Its a cruel lordling whos seized me.
2356,Chett,Theon,"There are miles and mountains still ahead of us, and I would hear of  this wolf king you served, and the golden lions he fights."
2357,Asha,Theon,"Off,"
2358,Asha,Theon,"Take the horse,and get these  damn dogs away-Lady Asha. she said."
2359,Asha,Theon,"The pimples went when the breasts came,but I kept the  vultures beak."
2360,Asha,Theon,Why didnt you tell me?
2361,Asha,Theon,I wanted to see who you were first.And I did.
2362,Asha,Theon,"And now, little brother, pray excuse me."
2363,Asha,Theon,I wonder if I still have that chainmail gown I like to wear over my boiled leather smallclothes? 
2364,Theon,Wex,Thats for enjoying this so much.
2365,Theon,Wex,"And thats for not warning  me.Next time, grow a tongue."
2366,Balon,Theon,"You come late, Theon,I ask your pardon."
2367,Asha,Theon,Youre in my place.
2368,Asha,Theon,"Brother, surely you are mistaken.Your place is at Winterfell."
2369,Asha,Theon,And where are all your pretty clothes?I heard you fancied silk and velvet against your  skin.
2370,Asha,Theon,"Your hauberk must have rusted away, sister,A great pity.Id like to see you all in  iron."
2371,Asha,Theon,"You may yet, little brother ."
2372,Asha,Theon,if you think your Sea Bitch can keep up with my  Black Wind.
2373,Asha,Theon,"Are you drinking ale or  wine tonight, Theon?"
2374,Asha,Theon,Or is it still a taste of my mothers milk you thirst for?
2375,Asha,Theon,"Wine,"
2376,Asha,Theon,Does Father know that youve  married his shipwright?
2377,Asha,Theon,No more than Sigrin does.
2378,Asha,Theon,Esgred was the first ship he built.
2379,Asha,Theon,I would be hard-pressed to say which he loves best.Every word you spoke to me was a lie.Not every word.Remember when I told you I like to be on top?
2380,Asha,Theon,"All that about being a woman wed, and new with child ."
2381,Asha,Theon,".Oh, that part was true enough."
2382,Asha,Theon,"Rolfe, here,"
2383,Asha,Theon,Theres my lord husband.
2384,Theon,Victarion,And heres my sweet suckling babe.
2385,Asha,Theon,Youd do well to heed what I told you about choosing a crew.
2386,Asha,Theon,"If you had  troubled to learn the first thing of Sigrin, I could never have fooled you."
2387,Asha,Theon,"Why should men fight and  die for you? I am their lawful prince,By the laws of the green lands, you might be.But we make our own laws here, or have you forgotten?"
2388,Balon,Theon,"Have done with your drink and come to my solar,We have plans to lay."
2389,Asha,Theon,My little brother is in a rush to be off.
2390,Asha,Theon,"Our lord father is waiting.And has, for many a year."
2391,Asha,Theon,You ought to have no trouble catching our uncles.
2392,Asha,Theon,"One is  drunk on seawater, after all, and the other is a great grey bullock so dim hell probably get lost."
2393,Asha,Theon,"I run after no man.No man, but every woman?It was not me who grabbed your cock.I dont have one, remember?You grabbed every other bit of me quick enough."
2394,Asha,Theon,Im a man with a mans hungers.What sort of unnatural  creature are you?Only a shy maid.
2395,Asha,Theon,"What, dont you want me to steer you into port, brother?Marriage is not for you,When I rule, I believe I will pack you off to the silent sisters."
2396,Balon,Dagmer,"I have made my plans.It is time you heard them.I have some suggestions-When I require your counsel I shall ask for it,We have had a bird from Old Wyk."
2397,Dagmer,Theon,  
2398,Dagmer,Theon,"What can I hope to accomplish with only eight longships?You are to harry the Stony Shore, raiding the fishing villages and sinking any ships you chance to meet."
2399,Balon,Theon,"Aeron will  accompany you, and Dagmer Cleftjaw.May the Drowned God bless our swords,"
2400,Asha,Dagmer,"Asha my daughter,"
2401,Asha,Theon,"March quickly, and the castle may fall before they even know you are upon them."
2402,Asha,Theon,"Ive always wanted a castle,Then take one."
2403,Eddard,Galbart,"Victarion,"
2404,Balon,Theon,"and if he is fool enough to try, his enemies will seal the south end of  the causeway behind him, and Robb the boy will find himself caught like a rat in a bottle."
2405,Balon,Theon,"A bold plan, Father, but the lords in their castles-The lords are gone south with the pup."
2406,Aeron,Victarion,"The rest shall be ours, forest and field and hall, and we shall make the folk our thralls and  salt wives."
2407,Aeron,Victarion,"And the waters of wrath will rise high, and the Drowned God will  spread his dominion across the green lands! What is dead can never die,"
2408,Asha,Theon,"You cant hold your wine either, brother."
2409,Asha,Theon,"I liked you better when  you were Esgred,"
2410,Asha,Theon,Thats fair.I liked you better when you were nine.
2411,Meryn,Tyrion,My lord
2412,Lancel,Tyrion,"Sweet sister,how beautiful you look tonight."
2413,Lancel,Tyrion,"And you as well, cousin.I had no  notion you had such a lovely voice."
2414,Cersei,Tyrion,Did Her  Grace send for you?
2415,Cersei,Tyrion,"Not that I recall,It grieves me to disturb your  revels, Lancel, but as it happens, I have matters of import to discuss with my sister."
2416,Cersei,Tyrion,"If you are here about those begging brothers, Tyrion, spare me your  reproaches."
2417,Cersei,Lancel,"They can preach to each other  in the dungeons.And count themselves lucky that they have such a gentle queen,I would have had their  tongues out.One even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because Jaime murdered the rightful king,It will not be borne, Tyrion.I gave you ample opportunity to deal with these lice, but  you and your Ser Jacelyn did nothing, so I commanded Vylarr to attend to the matter.And so he did."
2418,Cersei,Tyrion,No doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the streets.
2419,Cersei,Tyrion,"I  have tidings I know you will be anxious to hear, sweet sister, but they are best spoken of privily.Very well."
2420,Cersei,Tyrion,"Leave us, Lancel."
2421,Cersei,Tyrion,"If hed brought his pets, wed smell  them."
2422,Cersei,Tyrion,"Ill  have you know I make Shagga bathe once a fortnight,Youre very pleased with yourself, arent you?Why?Why not?"
2423,Cersei,Tyrion,"Is this the bed where Robert died?Im  surprised you kept it.It gives me sweet dreams,Now spit out your business and waddle away, Imp."
2424,Cersei,Tyrion,Lord Stannis has sailed from Dragonstone.
2425,Cersei,Tyrion,And yet you sit there grinning like a harvest-day pumpkin?
2426,Cersei,Tyrion,We must send a bird to Harrenhal at once.
2427,Cersei,Stannis,Stop it.
2428,Stannis,Tyrion,Stop it!
2429,Stannis,Tyrion,"I cant,Its too ."
2430,Stannis,Tyrion,   Tyrion managed.
2431,Cersei,Tyrion,Stannis and Renly are fighting each other?
2432,Cersei,Tyrion,"Gods be good,Im starting to believe that Robert was the clever one."
2433,Cersei,Tyrion,Do you think it will truly come to battle between them?   Tyrion said. Cersei said thoughtfully.
2434,Cersei,Robert,"When Robert gave the place to Renly, Stannis  clenched his jaw so tight I thought his teeth would shatter.He took it as a slight.It was meant as a slight,Shall we raise a cup to brotherly love?Yes,Oh, gods, yes."
2435,Cersei,Jaime,To Stannis!
2436,Cersei,Jaime,To Renly!
2437,Cersei,Jaime,"May they battle long and hard, and the Others take them both!"
2438,Gyles,Tyrion,Wet Nurse
2439,Shae,Tyrion,Call forth Ser Cleos Frey.
2440,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Ser Cleos,you have our thanks for bringing us this peace offer  from Lord Stark."
2441,Pycelle,Tyrion,"The Queen Regent, the Kings Hand, and the small council  have considered the terms offered by this self-styled King in the North.Sad to say, they will not do, and  you must tell these northmen so, ser.Here are our terms,Robb Stark must lay down his sword, swear fealty, and return to  Winterfell."
2442,Cleos,Stannis,"They shall be treated gently and given high places  here at court, so long as their fathers commit no new treasons.My lord Hand,Lord Stark will never consent to these terms."
2443,Cleos,Stannis,"Tell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock,  that soon it will march on him from the west while my lord father advances from the east."
2444,Cleos,Wyl,"Stannis and Renly Baratheon war against each other, and the Prince  of Dorne has consented to wed his son Trystane to the Princess Myrcella."
2445,Willem,Wyl,"As to this of my cousins,we offer Harrion Karstark and Ser Wylis Manderly for  Willem Lannister, and Lord Cerwyn and Ser Donnel Locke for your brother Tion."
2446,Cleos,Ilyn,"His fathers bones  he shall have, as a gesture of Joffreys good faith.Lord Stark asked for his sisters and his fathers sword as well,"
2447,Eddard,Tyrion,"Ice,Hell have that when he makes his peace with us, not before.As you say.And his sisters?Until such time as he frees my brother    Jaime, unharmed, they shall remain here as hostages."
2448,Robb,Tyrion,"I shall bring him your message, my lord."
2449,Tyrion,Vylarr,"Vylarr,My lord.The men Stark sent are sufficient to protect Lord Eddards bones, but a Lannister should have a  Lannister escort,Ser Cleos is the queens cousin, and mine.We shall sleep more  easily if you would see him safely back to Riverrun.As you command.How many men should I take?Why, all of them."
2450,Chett,Jacelyn,
2451,Cersei,Varys,".The Kingsguard and the City Watch protect them well enough.The gods speed you on your way,  Vylarr."
2452,Pycelle,Tyrion,"If any man has other matters to set before the Kings  Hand, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.I will be heard."
2453,Pycelle,Tyrion,Ser Alliser!
2454,Bronn,Tyrion,"Why, I had no notion that youd come to court.You should have sent  me word.I have, as well you know."
2455,Alliser,Bronn,"I have been shunned, ignored, and left to wait like some baseborn servant.Truly?"
2456,Alliser,Bronn,"We walked the Wall together.Sweet Ser Alliser,you must not think too harshly of us. quipped Petyr."
2457,Pycelle,Tyrion,"The Lord Commander sent me to His Grace the king,The matter is too grave to    be left to servants.The king is playing with his new crossbow,"
2458,Alliser,Joffrey,"You can speak to servants or hold your silence.As you will,I am sent to tell you that we found two  rangers, long missing."
2459,Tyrion,Varys,"One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker, while the second tried to murder the Lord Commander."
2460,Jeor,Tyrion,"I trust that the Old Bear  survived this attack?He did.And that your brothers killed these, ah, dead men?Youre certain that they are dead this time?"
2461,Alliser,Petyr,"Truly truly dead?They were dead the first time,Pale and cold, with black hands and feet.I  brought Jareds hand, torn from his corpse by the bastards wolf."
2462,Alliser,Petyr,And where is this charming token?
2463,Alliser,Petyr,it .
2464,Alliser,Petyr,Theres naught left to  show but bones.
2465,Alliser,Tyrion,"Lord Baelish,buy our brave Ser  Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him.Spades?"
2466,Alliser,Tyrion,"If you bury your dead, they wont come walking,Spades will end your troubles, with some strong backs to wield them.Ser Jacelyn, see that the good  brother has his pick of the city dungeons.As you will, my lord, but the cells are near empty. Tyrion told him."
2467,Alliser,Tyrion,Do you think I sailed all the way from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to be mocked by the  likes of you?
2468,Alliser,Tyrion,This is no jape.
2469,Alliser,Tyrion,"I tell you, the  dead walk.You should try to kill them more thoroughly."
2470,Alliser,Tyrion,"No closer, ser."
2471,Alliser,Tyrion,"You are a fool, Imp,"
2472,Alliser,Tyrion,Me?
2473,Alliser,Tyrion,"Then why were they laughing at you, I wonder?"
2474,Bronn,Tyrion,"You came for men, did you not?The cold winds are rising.The Wall must be held.And to hold it you need men, which Ive given you ."
2475,Alliser,Bronn,and to Jon Snow as well.
2476,Petyr,Varys,"I grow ever more admiring of  you, my lord,You appease the Stark boy with his fathers bones and strip your  sister of her protectors in one swift stroke."
2477,Petyr,Tyrion,"Oh, deftly done."
2478,Petyr,Tyrion,"Do you truly mean to send away all your guards, Lannister?No, I mean to send away all my sisters guards.The queen will never allow that.Oh, I think she may.I am her brother, and when youve known me longer, youll learn that I mean  everything I say.Even the lies?Especially the lies.Lord Petyr, I sense that you are unhappy with me.I love you as much as I ever have, my lord."
2479,Petyr,Tyrion,"if Myrcella  weds Trystane Martell, she can scarcely wed Robert Arryn, can she?Not without causing a great scandal,I regret my little ruse, Lord Petyr, but when we  spoke, I could not know the Dornishmen would accept my offer."
2480,Petyr,Tyrion,"I do not like being lied to, my lord.Leave me out of your next  deception."
2481,Petyr,Tyrion,"If  I have given offense, I am deeply sorry."
2482,Petyr,Tyrion,And how much  we need you.Try and remember that.
2483,Petyr,Tyrion,"Walk with me, Varys,"
2484,Tyrion,Varys,"Lord Baelish has the truth of it, you know.The queen will never permit you to send away her guard.She will.Youll see to that."
2485,Tyrion,Varys,"Will I?Oh, for a certainty.Youll tell her it is part of my scheme to free Jaime."
2486,Tyrion,Varys,"This would doubtless involve the four men your man Bronn searched  for so diligently in all the low places of Kings Landing.A thief, a poisoner, a mummer, and a murderer.Put them in crimson cloaks and lion helms, theyll look no different from any other guardsmen."
2487,Tyrion,Varys,"Theyll ride in by the main gate, flying Lannister banners and escorting Lord Eddards bones."
2488,Tyrion,Varys,Four men alone would be  watched vigilantly.
2489,Cleos,Tyrion,"as youll tell my sister.And for the sake of her beloved brother, she will consent, despite her misgivings."
2490,Cleos,Tyrion,"Still, the loss of her red cloaks will surely make her uneasy.I like her uneasy,"
2491,Timett,Tyrion,Come to my solar at midnight.
2492,Shagga,Small,"Shagga, what moon is this?"
2493,Shagga,Small,"Black, I think.In the west, they call that a traitors moon.Try not to get too drunk tonight, and see that your axe is    sharp.A Stone Crows axe is always sharp, and Shaggas axes are sharpest of all."
2494,Shagga,Small,Then it fell off.Is that why you never brush yours?
2495,Shagga,Timett,"Please, my lords,dont hurt me."
2496,Timett,Tyrion,"Go,Its not you we want.Shagga wants this woman.Shagga wants every whore in this city of whores,Yes,Shagga would give her a strong child.If she wants a strong child, shell know whom to seek,Timett, see her out ."
2497,Shagga,Tyrion,"gently, if  you would."
2498,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Tell me, does  the Citadel approve of you bedding the serving wenches, Maester?"
2499,Pycelle,Tyrion,Wwhat is the meaning of this?
2500,Pycelle,Tyrion,.
2501,Pycelle,Tyrion,"So loyal that you sent only one of my letters to Doran Martell.The  other you gave to my sister.N-no,No, a falsehood, I swear it, it was not me.  "
2502,Myrcella,Pycelle,that truth was only in the letter I entrusted to you.
2503,Pycelle,Varys,"Birds are lost, messages stolen or sold ."
2504,Petyr,Varys,"My lady prefers my blood hot.Make no mistake, for every secret the eunuch whispers in your ear, he holds seven back."
2505,Petyr,Shagga,.I know all about Lord Petyr.
2506,Petyr,Shagga,"Shagga, cut off his manhood and  feed it to the goats."
2507,Pycelle,Shagga,"There are no goats, Halfman.Make do."
2508,Timett,Tyrion,"Timett, do you suppose our friend will be more forthcoming without those whiskers to hide behind?"
2509,Timett,Tyrion,He will tell the truth soon.
2510,Shagga,Timett,I can smell the  stink of his fear.
2511,Shagga,Tyrion,"Hold still,  Maester,When Shagga gets angry, his hands shake.Shaggas hands never shake,How long have you been spying for my sister?"
2512,Pycelle,Tyrion,"All I did, I did for House Lannister."
2513,Aerys,Tyrion,Always .
2514,Aerys,Tyrion,.
2515,Aerys,Viserys,So the Sack of Kings Landing was your work as well?For the realm!
2516,Aerys,Eddard,".How many have you betrayed, I wonder?"
2517,Pycelle,Robert,"Where does it begin, Pycelle?"
2518,Pycelle,Robert,You .
2519,Chett,Jacelyn, he gasped when the blade moved upward to his    cheeks.
2520,Pycelle,Renly,".Oh, I know the boar did your work for you ."
2521,Pycelle,Renly,"but if hed left the job half done, doubtless you would  have finished it.He was a wretched king ."
2522,Pycelle,Tyrion,".And what was Lord Arryn plotting?He knew,About ."
2523,Pycelle,Tyrion,"I know what he knew about,He was sending his wife back to the Eyrie, and his son to be fostered on Dragonstone ."
2524,Pycelle,Shagga,So you poisoned him first.No.
2525,Pycelle,Tyrion,"I saw the tears of Lys among your potions.And you sent away Lord Arryns own  maester and tended him yourself, so you could make certain that he died.A falsehood!Shave him closer,The throat again."
2526,Pycelle,Shagga,I tried to save Lord Arryn.  
2527,Pycelle,Shagga,"Dolf fathered warriors, not barbers."
2528,Colemon,Varys,"Yes,"
2529,Tyrion,Varys,"It was not me who gave him the poison, though, I swear it."
2530,Tyrion,Varys,"Varys will tell  you, it was the boy, his squire, Hugh he was called, he must surely have done it, ask your sister, ask her."
2531,Tyrion,Varys,"Bind him and take him away,Throw him down in one of the  black cells."
2532,Tyrion,Varys,"Lannister,"
2533,Tyrion,Varys,.
2534,Gregor,Joffrey,"A kings man, he is,a good kings man like me, all for Joffrey."
2535,Arya,Chiswyck,"Tickler makes them howl so hard they piss themselves,"
2536,Harren,Tywin,"Youre  traitors and rebels, so thank your gods that Lord Tywins giving you this chance."
2537,Harren,Tywin,"Obey, serve, and live.Its not just, its not,We never did no treason, the others come in and took what they wanted, same as  this bunch.Lord Beric did us no hurt, though,And that red priest with him, he paid for all    they took.Paid?"
2538,Arya,Gregor,Will it give me eggs?
2539,Arya,Gregor,"Theres for the Tullys and theres for the Lannisters and theres for the Starks.Its a sin and a shame,When the old king was still alive, hed not have stood for  this.King Robert?"
2540,Arya,Gregor,"King Aerys, gods grace him,"
2541,Arya,Gregor,"Leave the body for the wolves,"
2542,Arya,Tickler,"Ser Gregor,Dunsen,  Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling."
2543,Arya,Tickler,"Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn,  King Joffrey, Queen Cersei."
2544,Harren,Hot,"I dont want to go there,Theres ghosts in  there."
2545,Chiswyck,Hot,"Baker boy, heres your choice.Come join the ghosts,  or be one."
2546,Amabel,Harra,"Got those churning butter, Ill wager,Some farmers whelp, are you?"
2547,Amabel,Arya,And what do they call you?
2548,Amabel,Arya,"Weasel,Lommy called me Weasel.I can see why,That hair is a fright and a nest for lice as well.Well have it  off, and then youre for the kitchens.Id sooner tend the horses."
2549,Arya,Harra,And keep that  tongue to yourself or youll get worse.No one asked your views.
2550,Amabel,Arya,"Lord Tywin and his knights have grooms and squires to tend their horses, they dont need the likes of  you,The kitchens are snug and clean, and theres always a warm fire to sleep  by and plenty to eat."
2551,Amabel,Weese,"Harra, I  believe we should give this one to Weese.If you think so, Amabel."
2552,Arya,Weese,"The Lannisters are generous to those as serve them well, an honor none  of your sort deserve, but in war a man makes do with whats to hand."
2553,Arya,Weese,"If you think to presume on his lordships kindness, though,  youll find me waiting after mlord has gone, ysee."
2554,Arya,Weese,"My nose never lies,I can smell defiance, I can smell pride, I can smell disobedience."
2555,Arya,Chett,"When I sniff you, all I want to smell is fear."
2556,Chett,Daenerys,"Qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be,It is the center of the world, the gate between north and south, the bridge between east    and west, ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent that Saathos the Wise put out his eyes after  gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and  ugly by comparison."
2557,Daenerys,Drogo,Milk Men
2558,Daenerys,Xaro,"If you see here anything that you would desire,  most  beautiful of women, you have only to speak and it is yours,Qarth itself is hers, she has no need of baubles,It  shall be as I promised, Khaleesi.Come with me to the House of the Undying, and you shall drink of truth  and wisdom.Why should she need your Palace of Dust, when I can give her sunlight and sweet water and silks to    sleep in?"
2559,Daenerys,Xaro,"The Thirteen shall set a crown of black jade and fire opals upon her  lovely head.The only palace I desire is the red castle at Kings Landing, my lord Pyat."
2560,Daenerys,Mirri,"And if the great of  Qarth would give me gifts, Xaro, let them give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine."
2561,Mirri,Xaro,"it shall be as you command, Khaleesi. "
2562,Mirri,Xaro,"The young queen is wise beyond her years,There is a saying in Qarth.A warlocks house is built of bones and lies.Then why do men lower their voices when they speak of the warlocks of Qarth?All across the east,  their power and wisdom are revered.Once they were mighty,"
2563,Jorah,Xaro,"Pyat Prees gifts will turn to dust in your hands, I warn you."
2564,Jorah,Xaro,"The crow calls the raven black,"
2565,Daenerys,Jorah,"You would do  well to avoid both those men, Your Grace.Those men will help me to my crown,Xaro has vast wealth, and Pyat Pree pretends to  power,"
2566,Daenerys,Jorah,"I would not linger here long, my queen.I mislike the very smell of this place."
2567,Daenerys,Jorah,Perhaps its the camels youre smelling.The Qartheen themselves seem sweet enough to  my nose.Sweet smells are sometimes used to cover foul ones.
2568,Daenerys,Xaro,"You are too generous,For the Mother of Dragons, no gift is too great."
2569,Daenerys,Xaro,"On the morrow, you shall feast  upon peacock and larks tongue, and hear music worthy of the most beautiful of women.The Thirteen  will come to do you homage, and all the great of Qarth."
2570,Daenerys,Xaro,A honor rare as summer snows.
2571,Daenerys,Jorah,"Beware,Of whom?Of all."
2572,Jorah,Xaro,"For dragons are fire made flesh, and fire is power."
2573,Jorah,Xaro,though I like her no more  than the others.I do not understand her.
2574,Aggo,Rakharo,"We  will keep our own watch so long as we are here.See that no one enters this wing of the palace without  my leave, and take care that the dragons are always well guarded.It shall be done, Khaleesi,We have seen only the parts of Qarth that Pyat Pree wished us to  see,Rakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find.Take good men  with you-and women, to go places where men are forbidden.As you say, I do, blood of my blood,Ser Jorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor."
2575,Aggo,Rakharo,Perhaps the gods will have blown some good captain here from  Westeros with a ship to carry us home.
2576,Aggo,Rakharo,"That would be no kindness.The Usurper will kill you, sure as sunrise."
2577,Aggo,Rakharo,My place is here at your side.Jhogo can guard me as well.
2578,Daenerys,Rakharo,"Go among the ships and speak to the  crews, learn where they are from and where they are bound and what manner of men command them."
2579,Daenerys,Rakharo,"As you say, my queen."
2580,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Irri,"
2581,Irri,Jorah,"Send him in, with whomever he  has brought,"
2582,Daenerys,Jorah,"Your  Grace,I bring you Quhuru Mo, captain of the Cinnamon Wind out of Tall Trees Town."
2583,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am greatly honored, my queen,The honor is mine, Quhuru Mo,Have you come from the Summer  Isles?This is so, Your Grace, but before, not half a year past, we called at Oldtown.From there I bring you a  wondrous gift.A gift?A gift of news.Dragonmother, Stormborn, I tell you true, Robert Baratheon is dead."
2584,Daenerys,Drogo,Dead?
2585,Daenerys,Drogo,"You are certain?The Usurper is dead?So it is said in Oldtown, and Dorne, and Lys, and all the other ports where we have called."
2586,Daenerys,Drogo,What was the manner of his death?
2587,Daenerys,Drogo,"Torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood, or so I heard in Oldtown."
2588,Daenerys,Drogo,Yet all the tales agree in this: King  Robert is dead and in his grave.
2589,Jorah,Robert,"The boy sits the Iron Throne now,King Joffrey reigns,"
2590,Jorah,Robert,He has been seized for treason.Eddard Stark a traitor?
2591,Daenerys,Jorah,Not bloody likely.The Long Summer will come again before  that one would besmirch his precious honor.What honor could he have?
2592,Daenerys,Jorah,"He was a traitor to his true king, as were these Lannisters."
2593,Daenerys,Drogo,"My brother is dead as well, Viserys who was the true king,Khal Drogo  my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold."
2594,Daenerys,Drogo,"Then I grieve for you, Dragonmother, and for bleeding Westeros, bereft of its rightful king."
2595,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"When does your ship return to Westeros,  Captain?Not for a year or more, I fear.From here the Cinnamon Wind sails east, to make the traders circle  round the jade Sea.I see,I wish you fair winds and good trading, then.You have brought me a  precious gift.I have been amply repaid, great queen."
2596,Daenerys,Jhiqui,How so?
2597,Daenerys,Jhiqui,I have seen dragons.
2598,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"And will see more of them one day, I hope.Come to me in Kings Landing when I am  on my fathers throne, and you shall have a great reward."
2599,Jhiqui,Jorah,"Khaleesi, I should not speak so freely of your plans, if I were  you. she said. Ser Jorah cautioned, This changes nothing, truly.This changes everything."
2600,Daenerys,Drogo,"Before, the Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogos khalasar, a  hundred thousand made as one by his strength.Now they fly to pieces, even as the khalasar did after my  khal lay dead.The high lords have always fought."
2601,Drogo,Jorah,  
2602,Jorah,Robert,I am not the frightened girl you met in Pentos.
2603,Jorah,Robert,"Mine is the  blood of the dragon.As was your brothers,I am not Viserys.No,There is more of Rhaegar in you, I think, but even Rhaegar could be slain."
2604,Jorah,Robert,Even dragons can die.Dragons die.
2605,Meera,Robert,But so do  dragonslayers.
2606,Bran,Meera,Yai!
2607,Bran,Jojen,Oof.
2608,Bran,Jojen,"You lose.She wins,Summers snared."
2609,Bran,Jojen,Let him out.
2610,Bran,Meera,"Summer, to me."
2611,Bran,Meera,"Watch,"
2612,Bran,Meera,"Good wolf,"
2613,Bran,Meera,Does he never grow angry?Not with me.
2614,Bran,Meera,"Sometimes he tears my garb but hes never drawn blood. Your blood, you mean.He wouldnt hurt you."
2615,Meera,Nan,"little grandfather,"
2616,Bran,Meera,I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders.
2617,Bran,Meera,"No, dont  help me."
2618,Bran,Meera,"See, I told you."
2619,Bran,Meera,"I never knew anyone who fought with a net before,Did your master-atarms teach you net-fighting?My father taught me."
2620,Bran,Meera,"No masterat-arms, and no maester.Who keeps your ravens?"
2621,Bran,Meera,"Ravens cant find Greywater Watch, no more than our enemies can.Why not?Because it moves,"
2622,Bran,Roose,"I wish I could see it.Do you think your lord father would let me  come visit when the war is over?You would be most welcome, my prince.Then or now.Now?"
2623,Bran,Roose,I could ask Ser  Rodrik when he returns.
2624,Jojen,Rodrik,Ser Rodrik might let me go.Maester  Luwin never would.
2625,Jojen,Meera,"It would be good if you  left Winterfell, Bran.It would?Yes.And sooner rather than later.My brother has the greensight,He dreams things that havent happened, but sometimes  they do.There is no sometimes, Meera."
2626,Bran,Meera,"Tell me whats going to happen,I will,if youll tell me about your dreams."
2627,Bran,Meera,"I dont have dreams.Maester Luwin gives me sleeping  draughts.Do they help?Sometimes.All of Winterfell knows you wake at night shouting and sweating, Bran. said Jojen."
2628,Bran,Jojen,"Maester Luwin says dreams might mean anything or nothing.My brother dreams as other boys do, and those dreams might mean anything,but the  green dreams are different."
2629,Bran,Jojen,"I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains,It was a green dream, so I knew it was true.A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the  stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.Did the crow have three eyes?"
2630,Bran,Meera,"When I was little I almost died of greywater fever.That was when the crow came to me.He came to me after I fell,I was asleep for a long  time.He said I had to fly or die, and I woke up, only I was broken and I couldnt fly after all.You can if you want to."
2631,Bran,Jojen,"You are the winged wolf, Bran,I wasnt sure when we first came, but now I am.The crow  sent us here to break your chains.Is the crow at Greywater?No.The crow is in the north.At the Wall?"
2632,Jon,Meera,Beyond the Wall.
2633,Bran,Meera,"When Jojen told our lord father what hed  dreamed, he sent us to Winterfell.How would I break the chains, Jojen?"
2634,Bran,Jojen,Open your eye.They are open Cant you see?Two are open.
2635,Bran,Jojen,"One, two.I only have two.You have three.The crow gave you the third, but you will not open it."
2636,Bran,Jojen,With two eyes you see my face.
2637,Bran,Meera,With three you would gaze south to the  Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall.
2638,Bran,Meera,I dont need to see so far.
2639,Bran,Meera,Im tired of talking  about crows.
2640,Bran,Meera,We dont have  them here.
2641,Bran,Meera,They live in the water.  Her brother interrupted. said Bran.  
2642,Bran,Jojen,I dont have to tell you my dreams.
2643,Bran,Jojen,"Im the Stark in  Winterfell.Was it Summer?You be quiet.The night of the harvest feast, you dreamed you were Summer in the godswood, didnt you?Stop it!"
2644,Bran,Jojen,"When I touched Summer, I felt you in him.just as you are in him now.You couldnt have."
2645,Bran,Jojen,"I was sleeping.You were in the godswood, all in grey.It was only a bad dream ."
2646,Bran,Jojen,.
2647,Bran,Jojen,I felt you.
2648,Bran,Jojen,"Is that what scares you, the falling?"
2649,Luwin,Meera,"Do you fall every night, Bran?"
2650,Bran,Meera,"Keep him back,  Bran.Jojen is making him angry."
2651,Bran,Meera,"Its your anger, Bran,Your fear.It isnt.Im not a wolf."
2652,Bran,Meera,"Part of you is Summer, and part of Summer is you.You know that, Bran."
2653,Bran,Meera,"Call him back, Bran.Summer!"
2654,Bran,Meera,"To me, Summer!"
2655,Bran,Meera,"Bran, call them off.I cant!Jojen, up the tree.Theres no need.Today is not the day I die.Do it!"
2656,Bran,Hodor,Hodor!
2657,Bran,Hodor,Hodor!Hodor!
2658,Bran,Hodor,"They wont hurt  Hodor,"
2659,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor, help  me."
2660,Bran,Hodor,"Chase them off.Hodor, Hodor,"
2661,Bran,Jojen,"We will talk again,"
2662,Bran,Luwin,"Hodor,bring me to Maester Luwin."
2663,Bran,Rickon,"My prince,youre early for lessons  today."
2664,Bran,Walder,"Hodor, stand still."
2665,Hodor,Luwin,Meera says her  brother has the greensight.
2666,Hodor,Luwin,Does she now?
2667,Hodor,Luwin,"You told me that the children of the forest had the greensight.I remember.Some claimed to have that power.Their wise men were called greenseers.Was it magic?Call it that for want of a better word, if you must.At heart it was only a different sort of knowledge.What was it?"
2668,Hodor,Luwin,"No one truly knows, Bran."
2669,Bran,Rickon,Does the Reed boy claim such  powers?No.
2670,Bran,Rickon,"But he has dreams that come true sometimes, Meera says.All of us have dreams that come true sometimes.You dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before  we knew he was dead, remember?Rickon did too.We dreamed the same dream.Call it greensight, if you wish ."
2671,Bran,Rickon,Do you perchance recall what I taught you about the  chain collar that every maester wears?
2672,Bran,Rickon,A maester forges his chain in the Citadel of Oldtown.
2673,Bran,Luwin,I dont remember them all.
2674,Chett,Luwin,"This is Valyrian steel,Only one maester in a hundred wears  such a link."
2675,Bran,Luwin,"All those who study the higher mysteries try their own hand at spells, soon or late."
2676,Bran,Luwin,"Sad to say, magic does not work.Sometimes it does,I had that dream, and Rickon did too."
2677,Bran,Luwin,".There are men who call themselves mages and warlocks,I had a friend at the  Citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear, but he was no more magical than I was."
2678,Bran,Jojen,"Perhaps magic was once a mighty force in the world, but no longer."
2679,Bran,Jojen,"No, my prince."
2680,Bran,Meera,No living man has that power.
2681,Jojen,Meera,Im sorry for what happened with the wolves.
2682,Jojen,Meera,"The crow lied when he said I could fly,  and your brother lied too.Or perhaps your maester is wrong.He isnt.Even my father relied on his counsel.Your father listened, I have no doubt."
2683,Bran,Jojen,"Bran, will you let me tell  you about a dream Jojen dreamed of you and your fosterling brothers?The Walders arent my brothers."
2684,Bran,Jojen,"You were sitting at supper, but instead of a servant, Maester Luwin brought you  your food."
2685,Bran,Walder,"Yet they  liked their supper better than you liked yours.I dont understand.You will, my brother says.When you do, well talk again."
2686,Bran,Jojen,"But there isnt,Theres no magic, and the stories  are just stories."
2687,Podrick,Tyrion,"My cousin chooses a queer hour to come  visiting,See him to my solar and tell him Ill be down shortly."
2688,Lancel,Tyrion,"Cousin,Your visits are too few.To what do I owe this undeserved pleasure?Her Grace the Queen Regent has sent me to command you to release  Grand Maester Pycelle."
2689,Cersei,Tyrion,Here is her warrant.So it is.
2690,Lancel,Tyrion,"I hope my sister is not overtaxing her strength, so soon after her illness.it would be a great pity if she were to suffer a relapse.Her Grace is quite recovered,Music to my ears."
2691,Jaime,Lancel,"Pod, build us a fire,  the air is too chilly for my taste."
2692,Lancel,Tyrion,"I find that mulled wine helps me  sleep.I need no help sleeping,I am come at Her Graces behest, not to drink with you,  Imp."
2693,Robert,Tyrion,Wine does have its dangers.
2694,Robert,Tyrion,As to Grand Maester  Pycelle .
2695,Cersei,Robert,"What am I to make of that?Make of it what you will, so long as you release your prisoner.The Grand Maester is a staunch friend  to the Queen Regent, and under her personal protection."
2696,Cersei,Tyrion,"Her Grace will never consent to this outrage.She  reminds you that she is Joffreys regent.As I am Joffreys Hand.The Hand serves,The regent rules until the king is of age.Perhaps you ought write that down so Ill remember it better."
2697,Lancel,Tyrion,"You may  leave us, Pod,"
2698,Cersei,Lancel,There is  more?Yes.Her Grace bids me inform you that Ser Jacelyn Bywater defied a command issued in the kings  own name.
2699,Lancel,Pycelle,I see.She insists that the man be removed from his office and placed under arrest for treason.  He set aside his wine cup.
2700,Lancel,Tyrion,"Have a  care how you speak to me, Imp."
2701,Lancel,Shagga,"Oh, unhand your sword."
2702,Lancel,Shagga,"With an axe, not a  wineskin."
2703,Lancel,Robert,I am a  knight-So Ive noted.
2704,Lancel,Varys,"What, nothing to say?No more warnings for  me, ser?You will withdraw these filthy accusations or-Please."
2705,Lancel,Varys,"No?What was it like, pray?The queen gave me the strongwine!Your own father Lord Tywin, when I was named the kings squire,  he told me to obey her in everything.Did he tell you to fuck her too?"
2706,Lancel,Tyrion,"No, I thought not.I never meant ."
2707,Chett,Jacelyn,
2708,Lancel,Tyrion,"A high place at court, knighthood,  my sisters legs opening for you at night, oh, yes, it must have been terrible for you."
2709,Lancel,Tyrion,Wait here.His Grace will want to hear this.
2710,Lancel,Tyrion,"Mercy,  my lord, I beg you.Save it for Joffrey.He likes a good beg.My lord, it was your sisters bidding, the queen, as you said, but His Grace ."
2711,Lancel,Tyrion,.Would you have me keep the truth from the king?For my fathers sake!
2712,Lancel,Tyrion,.
2713,Cersei,Lancel,I think not.
2714,Cersei,Lancel,My lord?You heard me.
2715,Lancel,Tyrion,"And you will be the one to tell me, wont you?Yes, my lord."
2716,Lancel,Tyrion,I will.
2717,Lancel,Tyrion,As you  command.Rise.
2718,Lancel,Tyrion,"Drink to our understanding.I promise, there  are no boars in the castle that I know of."
2719,Lancel,Tyrion,"Smile, cousin."
2720,Lancel,Tyrion,"If youre clever, youll have a lordship from me before youre done."
2721,Lancel,Tyrion,We want Cersei to have every faith in you.
2722,Lancel,Tyrion,"Tell her that you frightened me, that I want no conflict between us, that henceforth I shall do  nothing without her consent.But ."
2723,Lancel,Tyrion,"Oh, Ill give her Pycelle.You will?"
2724,Lancel,Tyrion,Ill release him on the morrow.
2725,Lancel,Tyrion,"Cersei can keep him as a pet or send him to the Wall, I  dont care which, but I wont have him on the council. And Ser Jacelyn?Tell my sister you believe you can win him away from me, given time.That ought to content her for a  while.As you say."
2726,Lancel,Tyrion,"One last thing.With King Robert dead, it would be most embarrassing should his grieving widow  suddenly grow great with child.My lord, I ."
2727,Lancel,Tyrion,"I spill my seed on her belly, my lord.A lovely belly, I have no doubt."
2728,Lancel,Tyrion,"I want no more nephews, is that clear?"
2729,Podrick,Tyrion,"Summon Bronn, and then run down to the stables and have two horses saddled."
2730,Podrick,Tyrion,"Horses.Those big brown animals that love apples, Im sure youve seen them."
2731,Bronn,Podrick,But Bronn    first.
2732,Bronn,Tyrion,Who pissed in your soup?
2733,Bronn,Tyrion,"Cersei, as ever."
2734,Bronn,Tyrion,"My gentle sister seems to  have mistaken me for Eddard Stark.I hear he was taller.Not after Joffrey took off his head.You ought to have dressed more warmly, the night is chill.Are we going somewhere?Are all sellswords as clever as you?"
2735,Alayaya,Bronn,"She will be so pleased to know youve come,I will see that the turret room  is made ready for you.Will my lord take a cup of wine while he waits?I will,"
2736,Alayaya,Tyrion,"You must forgive us, my lord,I cannot find good wine at any  price of late.You are not alone in that, I fear."
2737,Bronn,Tyrion,Is milord feeling unlove  ?
2738,Bronn,Tyrion,I have a cure for that.
2739,Bronn,Tyrion,"You are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but Ive grown fond of  Alayayas remedy.Youve never tried mine."
2740,Shae,Tyrion,"Shes good but Im better, dont you  want to see?Next time, perhaps."
2741,Alayaya,Tyrion,"I dont think he  wants to wait till next time,He wants to come out and count all my freckles, I think.Dancy."
2742,Alayaya,Tyrion,His lordship is come to visit  me.
2743,Alayaya,Tyrion,"Next  time,"
2744,Chett,Jacelyn,
2745,Shae,Tyrion,Elsewise she loses her black pearls to Marei.
2746,Shae,Tyrion,Id hate to have the poor child lose her  pearls on account of me.Then take her upstairs next time.Maybe I will.
2747,Shae,Tyrion,"I think not, my lord."
2748,Alayaya,Shae,What do  you do while Im gone?
2749,Alayaya,Shae,Sleep.
2750,Alayaya,Tyrion,"And Marei is teaching us to read, perhaps soon I will be able to pass the time  with a book.Sleep is good,And books are better."
2751,Tyrion,Varys,Its me.
2752,Shae,Varys,"Find me old, ugly, scarred men, preferably impotent,Men who  prefer boys.Or men who prefer sheep, for that matter."
2753,Shae,Tyrion,Have you woken her?
2754,Shae,Tyrion,"No, mlord.Good."
2755,Shae,Tyrion,"I just had the sweetest dream,  mlord."
2756,Shae,Tyrion,"This is no dream,"
2757,Tickler,Weese,"Weese,Dunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."
2758,Arya,Tickler,"Ser  Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei."
2759,Robert,Stannis,"Lord Tywin told him to burn the letter and never speak  such filth again,"
2760,Renly,Weese,"And both of them kings  now,Realms got more kings than a castles got rats."
2761,Beric,Joffrey,"The lads got no army but them gold cloaks, and hes ruled by    a eunuch, a dwarf, and a woman,What good will the likes of  them be if it comes to battle?"
2762,Arya,Beric,"Lorch killed the man  at Rushing Falls, and the Mountains slain him twice.Got me a silver stag says he dont stay dead this time  neither."
2763,Arya,Weese,"You dont want to know that lot, Weasel,"
2764,Arya,Weese,Who are they?
2765,Arya,Weese,"The Footmen, girl."
2766,Arya,Weese,Lord Tywins Bloody Mummers.Pease for wits. said Weese.
2767,Arya,Vargo,"The goat-helms their captain, Lord Vargo Hoat.Hes no fucking lord,I heard Ser Amory say so.Hes just some sellsword  with a mouth full of slobber and a high opinion of hisself.Aye,but she better call him lord if she wants to keep all her parts."
2768,Arya,Roose,"If    he crosses, Lord Tywin will smash him again like he did on the Green Fork,Boltonll never cross, not till the Young Wolf marches from Riverrun  with his wild northmen and all them wolves."
2769,Tickler,Weese,"Weese,Dunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."
2770,Tickler,Weese,"Ser Gregor, Ser  Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei."
2771,Arya,Jaqen,"A  girl says nothing,A girl keeps her lips closed, no one hears,  and friends may talk in secret.Yes?"
2772,Arya,Jaqen,"A boy becomes a girl,I was always a girl.I didnt think you saw me.A man sees.A man knows."
2773,Arya,Jaqen,You scared me.
2774,Arya,Jaqen,"Go away or Ill yell for Weese.A man pays his debts.A man owes three.Three? The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life."
2775,Arya,Jaqen,"Speak the names, and a man will do the rest."
2776,Arya,Joffrey,"Take me to Riverrun, its  not far, if we stole some horses we could-Three lives you shall have of me."
2777,Arya,Joffrey,So a girl must ponder.
2778,Arya,Joffrey,But not too long.
2779,Amory,Weese,"Weasel,next time I see that mouth droop open, Ill pull out your tongue and feed it to my bitch."
2780,Jon,Robb,"If you would  take a mans life, you owe it to him to look him in the face and hear his last words,"
2781,Arya,Weese,"They always have a good thirst, that lot,Weasel, go  up and ask if theyve got any clothes that need mending, Ill have the women see to it."
2782,Arya,Chiswyck,"After the Hands tourney, it were, before the war come,We were on our ways  back west, seven of us with Ser Gregor."
2783,Chett,Chiswyck,Ser just gave him this look.
2784,Chett,Chiswyck,"Meanwhile, this daughter of his has  been fetching and pouring, a fat little thing, eighteen or so-Thirteen, more like,Well, be that as it may, shes not much to look at, but Eggons been drinking and gets to touching her,  and might be I did a little touching meself, and Raffs telling young Stilwood that he ought t drag the girl  upstairs and make hisself a man, giving the lad courage as it were."
2785,Chiswyck,Gregor,"Ser Gregor, he wasnt paying no mind to none of our fun, but now he looks, you know how he does,  and he commands that the girl be brought before him."
2786,Arya,Chiswyck,"and damned if that old man didnt fetch a fistful of coppers, beg mlords  pardon, and thank him for the custom!"
2787,Arya,Jaqen,"Chiswyck,"
2788,Arya,Weese,"One of the Mountains men fell off a wallwalk last night and broke his fool  neck,Drunk?"
2789,Harren,Weese,No moren usual.Some are saying it was Harrens ghost flung him down.
2790,Catelyn,Hallis,"We are the first, my lady,"
2791,Catelyn,Wendel,"This is no fight of ours, my lady,I know the king would not  wish his mother to put herself at risk.We are all at risk,Do you think I wish to be here, ser?"
2792,Catelyn,Wendel,"Robb sent me south to speak for him, and  speak for him I shall."
2793,Catelyn,Stannis,"My lady,"
2794,Catelyn,Stannis,That will be King Stannis.No doubt.
2795,Catelyn,Stannis,"Lady Stark,"
2796,Catelyn,Stannis,"Lord Stannis,"
2797,Catelyn,Stannis,I had not thought to find you at Storms End.I had not thought to be here.
2798,Chett,Stannis,"I am sorry  for your lords death,though Eddard Stark was no friend to me.He was never your enemy, my lord.When the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne held you prisoned in that  castle, starving, it was Eddard Stark who broke the siege.At my brothers command, not for love of me,Lord Eddard did his duty, I will not  deny it."
2799,Robert,Stannis,I should have been Roberts Hand.That was your brothers will.Eddard never wanted it.Yet he took it.
2800,Robert,Stannis,"Still, I give you my word, you shall have justice for  his murder."
2801,Robert,Stannis,Your brother promised me the same.
2802,Robert,Stannis,"Cersei still  holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Roberts death.If your children are found when I take the city, they shall be sent to you."
2803,Robert,Stannis,"And when shall that be, Lord Stannis?Kings Landing is close to your Dragonstone, but I find you here  instead.You are frank, Lady Stark."
2804,Renly,Robert,"I must needs take them from him.Men give their allegiance where they will, my lord."
2805,Renly,Robert,  
2806,Renly,Stannis,"From him, and from these other  lords."
2807,Renly,Stannis,"And what cause brings you to this field, my lady?Has House Stark cast  its lot with my brother, is that the way of it?"
2808,Catelyn,Renly,"My son  reigns as King in the North, by the will of our lords and people.He bends the knee to no man, but holds  out the hand of friendship to all.Kings have no friends,only subjects and enemies.And brothers,"
2809,Renly,Stannis,"Lord Renly.King Renly.Can that truly be you, Stannis?"
2810,Renly,Stannis,Who else should it be?
2811,Renly,Stannis,"When I saw that standard, I could not be certain.Whose banner do you  bear?Mine own."
2812,Catelyn,Renly,The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
2813,Catelyn,Renly,"All for the good.If we both use the same banner, the battle will be  terribly confused.Let us hope there will be no battle."
2814,Renly,Stannis,"The Iron Throne is mine by rights.All those who deny that are my foes.The whole of the realm denies it, brother,Old men deny it with their death rattle, and  unborn children deny it in their motherswombs."
2815,Catelyn,Stannis,Sorry.
2816,Catelyn,Stannis,"I swore I would never treat with you while you wore your  traitors crown.Would that I had kept to that vow.This is folly,Lord Tywin sits at Harrenhal with twenty thousand swords."
2817,Cersei,Renly,"You each name yourself king, yet the kingdom bleeds, and no one lifts a sword to defend it  but my son."
2818,Renly,Stannis,Your son has won a few battles.
2819,Renly,Stannis,"The Lannisters can wait my  pleasure.If you have proposals to make, make them,or I will be gone.Very well,I propose that you dismount, bend your knee, and swear me your allegiance."
2820,Renly,Stannis,"That you shall never have.You served Robert, why not me?Robert was my elder brother.You are the younger.Younger, bolder, and far more comely ."
2821,Renly,Stannis,..
2822,Renly,Stannis,and a thief and a usurper besides.
2823,Renly,Stannis,The Targaryens called Robert usurper.
2824,Renly,Stannis,"Listen to yourselves!If you were sons of mine, I would bang your heads together and  lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
2825,Renly,Stannis,"You presume too much, Lady Stark."
2826,Robert,Stannis,His day will come as well.
2827,Joffrey,Robert,"You are very free to name others  traitor and usurper, my lord, yet how are you any different?"
2828,Joffrey,Renly,"and we are all traitors, however good our reasons."
2829,Joffrey,Renly,"You must forgive Lady Catelyn, Stannis."
2830,Renly,Stannis,"I fear she never saw your little letter.Joffrey is not my brothers seed,Nor is Tommen."
2831,Catelyn,Cersei,All three of them abominations born of incest.
2832,Catelyn,Renly,"Isnt that a sweet story, my lady?"
2833,Catelyn,Renly,"I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received  his letter, and I must say, it took my breath away."
2834,Renly,Stannis,"I had never suspected you  were so clever, Stannis.Were it only true, you would indeed be Roberts heir.Were it true?Do you name me a liar?Can you prove any word of this fable?"
2835,Cersei,Stannis,"Lord Stannis,if you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes, why did you  keep silent? I did not keep silent,I brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn.Rather than your own brother?My brothers regard for me was never more than dutiful,From me, such accusations  would have seemed peevish and selfserving, a means of placing myself first in the line of succession.I  believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn, whom he  loved.Ah,So we have the word of a dead man.Do you think he died by happenstance, you purblind fool?"
2836,Catelyn,Jon,  How inconvenient.
2837,Catelyn,Stannis,"My sister Lysa accused the queen of killing her  husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell,Later, in the Eyrie, she laid the murder at the  feet of the queens brother Tyrion."
2838,Renly,Stannis,"If you step in a nest of snakes, does it matter which one bites you first?All this of snakes and incest is droll, but it changes nothing.You may  well have the better claim, Stannis, but I still have the larger army."
2839,Renly,Stannis,"Would you like one, brother?"
2840,Renly,Stannis,"From Highgarden.Youve  never tasted anything so sweet, I promise you."
2841,Catelyn,Stannis,I did not come here to eat fruit.
2842,Catelyn,Stannis,My lords!
2843,Catelyn,Renly,"We ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance, not trading taunts.A man should never refuse to taste a peach,He may never  get the chance again."
2844,Renly,Stannis,Winter is coming.
2845,Renly,Stannis,"I did not come here to be threatened, either.Nor were you,When I make threats, youll know it."
2846,Renly,Stannis,"As Robert once gave it to me, I give it to YOU.It is not yours to give.It is mine by rights."
2847,Renly,Robert,"What am I to do with this brother of mine, Brienne?"
2848,Margaery,Robert,".We both know your wedding was a mummers farce.A year ago you were scheming to make the girl  one of Roberts whores.A year ago I was scheming to make the girl Roberts queen,"
2849,Margaery,Robert,"Youll be pleased to know she came to me a maid.In your bed shes like to die that way.h, I expect Ill get a son on her within the year."
2850,Renly,Stannis,"Oh,  yes-none."
2851,Renly,Stannis,"As to your daughter, I understand.If my wife looked like yours, Id  send my fool to service her as well.Enough!"
2852,Renly,Stannis,"I will not be mocked to my face, do you hear me?I will not!"
2853,Cersei,Stannis,Put up your steel!
2854,Catelyn,Stannis,"I am not without  mercy,Nor do I wish to sully Lightbringer with a  brothers blood."
2855,Renly,Rowan,"Otherwise, I shall  destroy you."
2856,Renly,Rowan,"Stannis, thats a very pretty sword, Ill grant you, but I think the glow off it has ruined  your eyes."
2857,Renly,Rowan,Can you see all those banners?Do you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?Tyrell swords will make me king.
2858,Catelyn,Stannis,"I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are, Stannis, that host of  yours wont survive the first charge of my vanguard.We shall see, brother."
2859,Catelyn,Stannis,"Come the dawn, we shall see.I hope your new gods a merciful one, brother."
2860,Catelyn,Renly,"Look to  your own sins, Lord Renly,"
2861,Loras,Renly,"That was amusing, if not terribly profitable,I wonder where I can get a sword  like that?"
2862,Catelyn,Loras,"it grieves me that it must come to  this.You have a cheerful way of grieving,Do I?"
2863,Renly,Stannis,So be it.
2864,Joffrey,Renly,   Renly admitted.
2865,Catelyn,Renly,  
2866,Catelyn,Renly,"You must allow a king some flaws, my lady."
2867,Brienne,Mathis,"My brother has not changed,Castles and courtesies will not  appease him, he must have blood.Well, I am of a mind to grant his wish.Your Grace, I see no need for battle here,The castle is strongly  garrisoned and well provisioned, Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander, and the trebuchet has  not been built that could breach the walls of Storms End."
2868,Mathis,Stannis,"He will find no  joy in it, and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless, we will take Kings Landing.And have men say I feared to face Stannis?Only fools will say that,"
2869,Randyll,Renly,"What say you all?I say that Stannis is a danger to you,Leave him unblooded and he will  only grow stronger, while your own power is diminished by battle."
2870,Robb,Stannis,or stronger.
2871,Eddard,Robb,"We shall fight, then."
2872,Catelyn,Eddard,"My lord,If you are set on battle,  my purpose here is done.I ask your leave to return to Riverrun.You do not have it."
2873,Catelyn,Renly,"I had hoped to help you make a peace, my lord.I will not help you make a war."
2874,Catelyn,Renly,"I daresay well prevail without your five-andtwenty, my lady.I do not mean for you  to take part in the battle, only to watch it.I was at the Whispering Wood, my lord."
2875,Bryce,Renly,"   Renly said, "
2876,Bryce,Mathis,"Well keep you safe, never fear."
2877,Bryce,Mathis,"Lord Mathis, you shall lead the center of my main battle."
2878,Bryce,Mathis,"Lord Estermont, you shall command the reserve.I shall not fail you, Your Grace,"
2879,Mathis,Rowan,"Who shall have the van?Your Grace,I beg the honor.Beg all you like,by rights it should be one of the seven who strikes the  first blow.It takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall,I was leading  Mace Tyrells van when you were still sucking on your mothers teat, Guyard."
2880,Catelyn,Renly,"Enough, my lords."
2881,Catelyn,Renly,"Ser Loras shall strike the first blow.With a glad heart, Your Grace."
2882,Catelyn,Renly,"Grant me your blessing,  and a knight to ride beside me with your banner.Let the stag and rose go to battle side by side."
2883,Catelyn,Renly,Brienne.Your Grace?
2884,Brienne,Catelyn,My place is at your side.
2885,Brienne,Catelyn,".One of seven,Never fear, four of your fellows will be with me in the fight."
2886,Brienne,Catelyn,"If I must part from Your Grace, grant me the honor of arming you for  battle."
2887,Renly,Robar,"Granted,Now leave me, all of you.Even kings must rest before a battle.My lord,there was a small sept in the last village we passed."
2888,Catelyn,Renly,"but see that she returns to us by  dawn.You might do well to pray yourself,For victory?For wisdom."
2889,Catelyn,Renly,"Loras, stay and help me pray."
2890,Catelyn,Robar,We shall give Stannis a  dawn he will not soon forget.
2891,Renly,Robar,"You are a long way from the Vale, ser,And you far from Winterfell, my lady.I know what brought me here, but why have you come?This is not your battle, no more than it is mine.I made it my battle when I made Renly my king.The Royces are bannermen to House Arryn.My lord father owes Lady Lysa fealty, as does his heir.A second son must find glory where he can."
2892,Catelyn,Robar,A man grows weary of tourneys.
2893,Catelyn,Lucas,"Lady Stark,Mollen says it is to be battle at dawn.Hal has the truth of it,"
2894,Catelyn,Lucas,"Do we fight or flee?We pray, Lucas,We pray."
2895,Chett,Jacelyn,
2896,Robb,Sansa,Tell me  what Ive done.Not you.Your kingly brother.Robbs a traitor.
2897,Robb,Sansa,I had no part in whatever he did.
2898,Ilyn,Sandor,"They trained you well, little bird."
2899,Boros,Joffrey,"Be brave,"
2900,Boros,Meryn,Your Grace.
2901,Meryn,Sandor,"Kneeling wont save you now,Stand up.Youre here to answer for your brothers latest  treasons.Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part.  "
2902,Lancel,Sansa,"Ser Lancel,tell her of this outrage."
2903,Lancel,Sansa,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell upon Ser Stafford Lannister  with an army of wargs, not three days ride from Lannisport."
2904,Joffrey,Sansa,"After the slaughter, the northmen feasted on the flesh of the  slain."
2905,Joffrey,Sansa,You have nothing to say?
2906,Dontos,Joffrey,"Your Grace, the poor child is shocked witless,Silence, fool."
2907,Dontos,Joffrey,"You Starks are as unnatural as  those wolves of yours.Ive not forgotten how your monster savaged me.That was Aryas wolf,Lady never hurt you, but you killed her anyway.No, your father did,"
2908,Dontos,Joffrey,I shot the loudest one right through the throat.And he died?
2909,Dontos,Florian,"Of course he died, he had my quarrel in his throat.There was a woman throwing rocks, I got her as  well, but only in the arm."
2910,Dontos,Florian,"Id shoot you too, but if I do Mother  says theyd kill my uncle Jaime."
2911,Dontos,Florian,"Dog, hit her.Let me beat her!"
2912,Dontos,Florian,morningstar
2913,Florian,Sansa,"Traitor, traitor"
2914,Joffrey,Meryn,Boros.Meryn.
2915,Joffrey,Sansa,"Leave her face,I like her pretty."
2916,Boros,Sansa,"Enough,No it isnt,Boros, make her naked."
2917,Sansa,Tyrion,"Beat her bloody,well see how her brother fancies-What is the meaning of this?"
2918,Sansa,Tyrion,"Is this your notion of chivalry, Ser Boros?"
2919,Boros,Meryn,"What sort of knight beats helpless maids?The sort who serves his king, Imp."
2920,Meryn,Sandor,"Careful with those,You dont want to get blood all over those pretty  white cloaks.Someone give the girl something to cover herself with,"
2921,Boros,Joffrey,"This girls to be your queen,Have you no regard for her honor?Im punishing her.For what crime?She did not fight her brothers battle.She has the blood of a wolf.And you have the wits of a goose.You cant talk to me that way.The king can do as he likes.Aerys Targaryen did as he liked.Has your mother ever told you what happened to him?"
2922,Boros,Tyrion,No man threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
2923,Boros,Tyrion,"I am not threatening the king, ser, I am educating my nephew.Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth, kill him."
2924,Boros,Tyrion,"Now that was a  threat, ser.See the difference?"
2925,Boros,Tyrion,The queen will hear of this!No doubt she will.
2926,Boros,Tyrion,"Joffrey, shall we send for your mother? "
2927,Boros,Tyrion,"Nothing to say, Your Grace?"
2928,Boros,Joffrey,Good.
2929,Joffrey,Sansa,"or  your queens.Fear is better than love, Mother says."
2930,Joffrey,Sansa,She fears me.
2931,Sansa,Stannis,"Yes, I see."
2932,Renly,Sansa,"Bronn, Timett,  bring her."
2933,Dontos,Sansa,"Sleep a  bit, child.When you wake, all this will seem a bad dream."
2934,Arya,Sansa,Where does she think shes  going?
2935,Arya,Sansa,"The godswood.- She had to find Ser Dontos, beg him to take her home now before it was too late.The halfman said youre not to leave,Pray here, the gods will hear."
2936,Arya,Sansa,"Take it away,"
2937,Sansa,Tyrion,Yes?
2938,Sansa,Tyrion,My lady.I trust I am not disturbing you?Am I your prisoner?My guest.
2939,Sansa,Tyrion,I thought we might  talk.As my lord commands.
2940,Sansa,Stafford,The food and garments are to your satisfaction?
2941,Sansa,Stafford,"If there is anything else you need, you have  only to ask.You are most kind."
2942,Sansa,Stafford,it was very good of you to help me.You have a right to know why Joffrey was so wroth.
2943,Robb,Stafford,We received word only this morning.
2944,Robb,Stafford,Its .
2945,Robb,Stafford,My brother is a vile traitor.
2946,Robb,Stafford,"Well, hes no fawn, hes made that clear enough.Ser Lancel said Robb led an army of wargs  The Imp gave a disdainful bark of laughter.Ser Lancels a wineskin warrior who wouldnt know a warg  from a wart."
2947,Martyn,Rickard,Those who survived are spreading wild tales and    swearing that the old gods of the north march with your brother.Then .
2948,Martyn,Rickard,there was no sorcery?
2949,Martyn,Rickard,Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own  incompetence.
2950,Joffrey,Sansa,"Our forces still hold the stronghold at the Golden Tooth, and they swear  he did not pass."
2951,Joffrey,Sansa,"Well, Robb Stark is my fathers bane."
2952,Joffrey,Sansa,"Tell me, what do you feel for my kingly nephew?I love him with all my heart,Truly?"
2953,Joffrey,Sansa,Even now?My love for His Grace is greater than it has ever been.
2954,Joffrey,Sansa,"Well, someone has taught you to lie well."
2955,Joffrey,Sansa,Or have you flowered?
2956,Joffrey,Sansa,"No, my lord.Thats all to the good."
2957,Joffrey,Tyrion,"The match was one  of King Roberts better notions, if Joffrey hadnt mucked it up."
2958,Sansa,Tyrion,"You grow very quiet,Is this what you want?An end to your betrothal?I ."
2959,Sansa,Tyrion,.
2960,Robb,Sansa,"I only want to be loyal.Loyal,"
2961,Robb,Sansa,"When I was  your age, I wanted the same thing."
2962,Robb,Sansa,"They tell me you visit the godswood every day.What do  you pray for, Sansa?"
2963,Robb,Sansa,"I pray for an end to the  fighting.Well have that soon enough.There will be another battle, between your brother Robb and my lord  father, and that will settle the issue."
2964,Robb,Sansa,"Do not take Oxcross  too much to heart, my lady,A battle is not a war, and my lord father is  assuredly not my uncle Stafford."
2965,Dontos,Sansa,"Once the north returns to the kings peace, I mean to send you home.You may sleep here tonight.Ill give you some of my own  men as a guard, some Stone Crows perhaps-No,"
2966,Dontos,Joffrey,"Would you prefer Black Ears?Ill give you Chella if a woman would make you more at ease.Please, no, my lord, the wildlings frighten me."
2967,Dontos,Joffrey,Me as well.
2968,Joffrey,Tyrion,"With Chella or Timett by your side, no one would dare offer you  harm.I would sooner return to my own bed."
2969,Joffrey,Tyrion,"This tower was  where my fathers men were slain.Their ghosts would give me terrible dreams, and I would see their  blood wherever I looked."
2970,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I am no stranger to nightmares, Sansa."
2971,Catelyn,Tyrion,Permit me at least to escort you safely back to your own chambers.
2972,Catelyn,Spare,"My lady, look down on this battle with a mothers eyes."
2973,Bran,Rickon,Would that I were with them.
2974,Catelyn,Cersei,"Does Cersei pray to you too, my lady?"
2975,Catelyn,Cersei,"Each of the  Seven embodies all of the Seven,"
2976,Catelyn,Small,"Bran knows too,"
2977,Catelyn,Robb,"Guide me, wise lady,Show me the path I must walk,  and do not let me stumble in the dark places that lie ahead."
2978,Catelyn,Robb,"My lady,pardon, but our time is at an end."
2979,Catelyn,Renly,"Thank you, ser.I am ready."
2980,Brienne,Renly,"I must speak with you, Your Grace,In a moment, Lady Catelyn,"
2981,Mathis,Rowan,"Pray continue, Lord Mathis.Your Grace,As I was saying, our battles are  well drawn up."
2982,Catelyn,Randyll,"Sound the advance.And have it said that I won by treachery, with an unchivalrous attack?Dawn was the chosen hour.Chosen by Stannis,Hed have us charge into the teeth of the rising sun.Well be half-blind.Only until first shock,Ser Loras will break them, and after that it will be  chaos."
2983,Brienne,Rowan,"When my brother falls, see  that no insult is done to his corpse.He is my own blood, I will not have his head paraded about on a  spear.And if he yields?"
2984,Renly,Rowan,Yields?
2985,Renly,Rowan,"When Mace Tyrell laid siege to Storms End, Stannis ate rats rather  than open his gates.Well I remember."
2986,Brienne,Stannis,"Near the end, Ser  Gawen Wylde and three of his knights  tried to steal out a postern gate to surrender."
2987,Gawen,Rowan,He had been our  master-at-arms.
2988,Renly,Rowan,"No men were hurled from the walls.I would surely remember that.Maester Cressen told Stannis that we might be forced to eat our dead, and there was no gain in flinging  away good meat."
2989,Catelyn,Renly,"Thanks to the Onion Knight we were never  reduced to dining on corpses, but it was a close thing.Too close for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell.Your Grace."
2990,Catelyn,Renly,You promised me a word.
2991,Renly,Rowan,"See to your battles, my lords ."
2992,Renly,Rowan,"oh, and if Barristan Selmy is at my brothers side, I  want him spared.Theres been no word of Ser Barristan since Joffrey cast him out,I know that old man."
2993,Catelyn,Robb,"Where else but with Stannis?As you say, Your Grace.No harm will come to him."
2994,Brienne,Renly,"Say your say, Lady Stark,"
2995,Brienne,Renly,The Lannisters tried to kill my son Bran.
2996,Renly,Robb,"Robert and Eddard and most of the other men rode out  after boar, but Jaime Lannister remained at Winterfell, as did the queen."
2997,Renly,Robb,So you believe the boy caught them at their incest .
2998,Renly,Robb,".I beg you, my lord, grant me leave to go to your brother Stannis and tell him what I suspect.To what end?Robb will set aside his crown if you and your brother will do the same,"
2999,Bran,Robb,"Let the three  of you call for a Great Council, such as the realm has not seen for a hundred years."
3000,Brienne,Renly,Let the  assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose who shall rule them.
3001,Brienne,Renly,"Tell me, my lady, do direwolves vote on who should lead the pack?"
3002,Brienne,Renly,The time for talk is done.Now we see who is stronger.
3003,Brienne,Catelyn,"I beg you in the name of the Mother,"
3004,Brienne,Renly,"Cold,"
3005,Blue,Brienne,Your Gr-no!
3006,Emmon,Robar,Wicked woman!
3007,Brienne,Robar,"Away from him, you vile creature!Gods be good, Brienne, why?"
3008,Catelyn,Emmon,I .
3009,Catelyn,Emmon,.Youll die for this.
3010,Catelyn,Emmon,Youll pay for the kings life with your own!NO!
3011,Catelyn,Robar,"Robar, no, listen."
3012,Catelyn,Robar,"You do her wrong, it was not her."
3013,Catelyn,Robar,"Hear me, it was Stannis."
3014,Catelyn,Robar,"I swear it,  you know me, it was Stannis killed him."
3015,Catelyn,Robar,"Stannis?How?I do not know. Her own voice sounded  wild and crazed to her, but the words poured out in a rush as the blades continued to clash behind her."
3016,Emmon,Robar,Help her!
3017,Emmon,Robar,"She is innocent, Robar.You have  my word, on my husbands grave and my honor as a Stark! "
3018,Emmon,Robar,"I will hold them,Get her away."
3019,Brienne,Catelyn,"Brienne, with me,"
3020,Brienne,Catelyn,"This way,"
3021,Brienne,Catelyn,"Walk easy, as if nothing were amiss."
3022,Brienne,Eddard,"I never held him but as he died,"
3023,Brienne,Eddard,"He was laughing one moment, and suddenly the  blood was everywhere ."
3024,Brienne,Eddard,"?I saw a shadow.I thought it was Renlys shadow at the first, but it was his brothers.Lord Stannis?I felt him."
3025,Brienne,Wendel,"I will kill him,With my lords own  sword, I will kill him."
3026,Brienne,Wendel,I swear it.
3027,Brienne,Wendel,"My lady, the camp has gone mad,Lord Renly, is he-Dead, but not by our hands.The battle-There will be no battle."
3028,Perwyn,Wendel,"Brienne, we brought mounts enough for twice our number.Choose one, and come with us.I have my own horse, my lady.  "
3029,Brienne,Catelyn,That will not be forgotten.
3030,Brienne,Catelyn,"Ride,If any man tries to stop us, cut him down."
3031,Chett,Jacelyn,
3032,Chett,Jon,Find the wolf later.
3033,Jon,Thoren,"This is good  ground, Thoren,We could scarce hope for  better.Well make our camp here to await Halfhand."
3034,Small,Thoren,"An old place, and strong,Old,Old, old, old.Quiet,"
3035,Jon,Thoren,"These heights will be easy to defend, if need be,Yes, this place will do."
3036,Jon,Thoren,"What about water, my lord?"
3037,Jon,Thoren,"We crossed a brook at the foot of the hill.A long climb for a drink,and outside the ring of stones.Are you too lazy to climb a hill, boy?Were not like to find another place as strong.Well carry water, and make  certain we are well supplied,"
3038,Chett,Jon,"I will have every  opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark,"
3039,Chett,Jon,"Ghost, whats wrong with you?"
3040,Chett,Jon,"As you will,Go, hunt."
3041,Chett,Jon,"Stop acting the boy,"
3042,Jon,Samwell,Jon?
3043,Jon,Samwell,I thought it looked like you.Are you well? Well enough.
3044,Jon,Samwell,How did you fare today?Well.
3045,Jon,Samwell,Truly.
3046,Jon,Samwell,"The Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and the men from the Shadow  Tower.It seems a strong place,A ringfort of the First Men."
3047,Jon,Samwell,"Mormont will want to send back word.I wish I could send them all.They hate being caged.You would too, if you could fly.If I could fly, Id be back at Castle Black eating a pork pie,"
3048,Small,Thoren,"Id best see to the Old Bear,He gets noisy when he isnt fed as well."
3049,Small,Thoren,"There you are,Bring us some hot wine, if you would.The night is chilly.Yes, my lord."
3050,Chett,Jacelyn,"The easiest road up  into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to its source. said Ser Mallador Locke, "
3051,Jon,Ottyn,"Corn, Corn.Corn. "
3052,Jon,Ottyn,"I would not go into the mountains at all,The Frostfangs have a cruel bite even in summer, and now ."
3053,Jon,Ottyn,".I do not mean to risk the Frostfangs unless I must,Wildlings can no more live on snow  and stone than we can."
3054,Jarman,Jon,"They cannot hope to slip by us.They may not wish to.They are thousands, and we will be three  hundred when the Halfhand reaches us."
3055,Jarman,Jon,"If it comes to battle, we could not hope for better ground than here,Well  strengthen the defenses."
3056,Small,Thoren,"it will keep the men occupied, and may prove needful later.My rangers-Your rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches us."
3057,Small,Thoren,"I will not lose more of my men.Mance Rayder might be massing his host a days ride from here, and wed never know,We know where the wildlings are massing,We had it from Craster.I mislike  the man, but I do not think he lied to us in this.As you say."
3058,Jon,Small,"Shall I bring you supper, my lord?"
3059,Jon,Small,"Corn,"
3060,Jon,Small,Did your wolf find  game today?Hes not back yet.We could do with fresh meat.
3061,Jon,Small,"You  think Im wrong to keep the rangers close? Thats not for me to say, my lord.It is if youre asked.If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist, I dont see how they can hope to find my uncle,They cant."
3062,Jon,Small,"Two hundred men or ten  thousand, the country is too vast."
3063,Jon,Small,You would not give up the search?Maester Aemon thinks you clever.
3064,Chett,Jon,Is it .
3065,Chett,Jon,it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find two hundred  than for two hundred to find one.
3066,Chett,Jon,This many  men and horses leave a trail even  Aemon could follow.
3067,Chett,Jon,"If Ben Stark is alive and free, he will come to us, I have no doubt.Yes,"
3068,Chett,Jacelyn,
3069,Chett,Jon,hes dead?
3070,Chett,Jon,"Dead,Dead.Dead.He may come to us anyway,As Othor did, and Jafer Flowers.I dread that as  much as you, Jon, but we must admit the possibility.Dead,"
3071,Dywen,Jon,Dead.
3072,Dywen,Jon,"I will  forsake supper, I believe."
3073,Dywen,Jon,"Wake me at first light.Sleep well, my lord."
3074,Dywen,Grenn,"I know this wood as well as any man alive, and I tell you, I  wouldnt care to ride through it alone tonight.Cant you smell it?"
3075,Grenn,Jon,"Which has a similar aroma, now that I come to sniff it.Ive got your similar aroma right here."
3076,Grenn,Jon,"What is it you smell, Dywen?"
3077,Grenn,Jon,Seems to me like it smells .
3078,Grenn,Jon,"cold. Your heads as wooden as your teeth,Theres no smell to cold."
3079,Dywen,Jon,"Ghost,So you came inside after all, eh?"
3080,Dywen,Jon,Was the hunting so bad?
3081,Dywen,Jon,"Here.To  me, Ghost."
3082,Dywen,Jon,"is something out there?Ghost, do you have a scent?"
3083,Chett,Jon,"I need to fetch water for the  Lord Commander.Go on, then,Be quick about it."
3084,Bran,Jon,"Ghost,to me.Now"
3085,Bran,Jon,"Ghost, no, stay,"
3086,Chett,Jon,What have you found?
3087,Bran,Mikken,"Maester wants you in the turret,  mlord prince.Theres been a bird from the king.From Robb?"
3088,Alebelly,Luwin,"My lords,"
3089,Bran,Rickon,"He writes us from  Ashemark, formerly the stronghold of House Marbrand."
3090,Bran,Rickon,"Is Robb coming home?Not just yet, I fear.There are battles yet to fight.Was it Lord Tywin he defeated?"
3091,Bran,Rickon,"No,Ser Stafford Lannister commanded the enemy host.He was slain in the battle."
3092,Rickon,Walder,"Lord Tywin is the only one who matters.Tell Robb I want him to come home,He can bring his  wolf home too, and Mother and Father."
3093,Luwin,Walder,"Sadly, no victory is without cost."
3094,Luwin,Walder,"My lords, your uncle Ser  Stevron Frey was among those who lost their lives at Oxcross."
3095,Big,Robb,"It was not thought to be serious, but three days later he died in his tent, asleep."
3096,Big,Walder,He was very old.
3097,Big,Walder,He was always  saying he was tired.
3098,Ryman,Walder,"Tired of waiting for our grandfather to die, you mean.Does this mean Ser  Emmons the heir now?Dont be stupid,The sons of the first son come before the second son."
3099,Petyr,Walder,"And then Aegon and all his sons.Ryman is old too,Past forty, I bet."
3100,Luwin,Walder,Do you think hell be  lord?Ill be lord.I dont care if he is.
3101,Luwin,Walder,"You ought to be ashamed of such talk, my lords."
3102,Luwin,Walder,"Your uncle is dead.Yes,Were very sad."
3103,Hodor,Luwin,Very well.
3104,Alebelly,Bran,"Osha,Do you know the way north?"
3105,Bran,Osha,"and  even past?The ways easy.Look for the Ice Dragon, and chase the blue star in the riders eye."
3106,Bran,Osha,"And there are still giants there, and ."
3107,Bran,Osha,"the Others, and the children of the forest too?The giants Ive seen, the children Ive heard tell of, and the white walkers ."
3108,Bran,Osha,why do you want to  know?Did you ever see a three-eyed crow?No.
3109,Bran,Osha,And I cant say Id want to.
3110,Bran,Meera,You heard about the bird?
3111,Bran,Robb,It wasnt a supper like you said.   jojen admitted. Bran said.
3112,Bran,Robb,It is the sea that comes.The sea?I dreamed that the sea was lapping all around Winterfell.
3113,Alebelly,Bran,Your  smith as well.Mikken?
3114,Bran,Meera,"But the sea is hundreds and hundreds of leagues    away, and Winterfells walls are so high the water couldnt get in even if it did come.In the dark of night the salt sea will flow over these walls,I saw the dead, bloated and  drowned.We have to tell them,Alebelly and Mikken, and Septon Chayle.Tell them not to drown.It will not save them,"
3115,Bran,Meera,"They will not believe, Bran.No more  than you did."
3116,Bran,Meera,Tell me what you dream.
3117,Bran,Meera,"Theres different kinds,Theres the wolf dreams, those arent so bad as the  others."
3118,Jojen,Meera,But the worst dreams are  when I fall.
3119,Jojen,Meera,I never used to fall before.
3120,Jojen,Meera,"Only I did, and now when I sleep I fall all the time."
3121,Jojen,Meera,"Is that all?I guess.Warg,"
3122,Bran,Jojen,What?Warg.
3123,Bran,Jojen,"That is what they will call ~ou, if they should ever hear of your wolf  dreams."
3124,Bran,Nan,Who will call me?Your own folk.
3125,Bran,Nan,Some will even try to kill you.
3126,Bran,Nan,"Im not like that,Im not.Its only dreams.The wolf dreams are no true dreams."
3127,Bran,Jojen,The power is strong in you.I dont want it.I want to be a knight.A knight is what you want.
3128,Bran,Jojen,"You are the winged wolf, but you will never fly."
3129,Bran,Jojen,Unless you open your eye.
3130,Bran,Jojen,"How can I open it if its not there?You will never find the eye with your fingers, Bran.You must search with your heart."
3131,Bran,Jojen,"Or are you afraid?Maester Luwin says theres nothing in dreams that a man need fear. There is,What?The past."
3132,Bran,Jojen,The truth.
3133,Jojen,Mikken,"The sea, is it?"
3134,Alebelly,Bran,"The gods are good, to  take such trouble for a poor smith.The gods will take me when they see fit,"
3135,Alebelly,Bran,Im quite the strong swimmer.
3136,Alebelly,Hayhead,"Reek, hes called,I never heard his true name.He served  the Bastard of Bolton and helped him murder Lady Hornwood, they say."
3137,Luwin,Rodrik,"The monster has tied us a thorny knot,Like it or no, Lady  Hornwood was his wife."
3138,Robb,Rodrik,"She signed a will naming him as heir and fixed her seal to it.Vows made at sword point are not valid,Roose Bolton may not agree.Not with land at issue."
3139,Robb,Rodrik,"Would that I could    take this serving mans head off as well, hes as bad as his master."
3140,Bran,Robb,"Perhaps when  Lord Bolton hears his tale, he will abandon his claim, but meantime we have Manderly knights and  Dreadfort men killing one another in Hornwood forests, and I lack the strength to stop them."
3141,Bran,Luwin,"And what have you been about while Ive been  away, my lord prince?"
3142,Bran,Luwin,"Do you want them smelling like this  Reek, is that it?The sea is coming here,Jojen saw it in a green dream.Mebelly is going to drown."
3143,Bran,Luwin,"The Reed boy believes he sees the future in his dreams, Ser  Rodrik."
3144,Bran,Rodrik,"Leobald  Tallhart has sent his nephew Benfred to deal with them, but I expect theyll take to their ships and flee at  the first sight of armed men.Aye, and strike somewhere else."
3145,Bran,Rodrik,"They would never dare, no more  than the Bastard of Bolton, if our main strength were not a thousand leagues south."
3146,Bran,Rodrik,"What else did the lad tell you?He said the water would flow over our walls.He saw Alebelly drowned, and Mikken and Septon  Chayle too."
3147,Bran,Rodrik,"Well, should it happen that I need to ride against these raiders myself, I shant take  Alebelly, then."
3148,Bran,Rodrik,Good.
3149,Bran,Meera,The things I see in green dreams cant be changed.
3150,Bran,Meera,"Why would the gods send a warning if we cant heed it and change whats to  come?I dont know,If you were Alebelly, youd probably jump into the well to have done with it!He should fight, and Bran  should too.Me?"
3151,Bran,Meera,What should I fight?Am I going to drown too?
3152,Jojen,Meera,I shouldnt have said  He could tell that she was hiding something.Did you see me in a green dream?
3153,Jojen,Meera,Was I drowned?Not drowned.
3154,Jojen,Meera,"I dreamed of the man who came today, the  one they call Reek.You and your brother lay dead at his feet, and he was skinning off your faces with a  long red blade."
3155,Bran,Meera,"If I went to the dungeon, I could drive a spear right through his heart.How  could he murder Bran if he was dead?The gaolers will stop you,The guards.And if you tell them why you want him dead, theyll  never believe.I have guards too,Alebelly and Poxy Tym and Hayhead and the rest."
3156,Bran,Jojen,"They wont be able to stop him, Bran."
3157,Bran,Jojen,"I saw you and Rickon in  your crypts, down in the dark with all the dead kings and their stone wolves."
3158,Bran,Jojen,If I went away .
3159,Bran,Jojen,".It will not matter.The dream was green, Bran, and the green dreams do not lie."
3160,Cersei,Renly,It would ppear Renly was murdered most fearfully  in the very midst of his army.His throat was opened from ear to ear by a blade that passed through steel  and bone as if they were soft cheese.Murdered by whose hand?
3161,Cersei,Renly,Have you ever considered that too many answers are the same as no answer at all?
3162,Petyr,Varys,The third ventures  that it might have been the Lady Catelyn Stark.
3163,Petyr,Varys,"Must you waste our time with every rumor the fools care to tell?You pay me well for these rumors, my gracious queen.We pay you for the truth, Lord Varys.Remember that, or this small council may grow smaller still."
3164,Petyr,Varys,"You and your noble brother will leave His Grace with no council at all if you  continue.I daresay, the realm could survive a few less councillors,Dear dear Petyr,are you not concerned that yours might be the next name on the Hands  little list?Before you, Varys?I should never dream of it.Mayhaps we will be brothers on the Wall together, you and ISooner than youd like, if the next words out of your mouth are not something useful, eunuch."
3165,Petyr,Varys,Might this be some ruse?
3166,Petyr,Varys,"If so, it is a ruse of surpassing cleverness,It has certainly hoodwinked me."
3167,Tyrion,Varys,"Joffrey will be so disappointed,He was saving such a nice spike for  Renlys head."
3168,Stannis,Tyrion,The gain is clearly his.
3169,Petyr,Varys,What of Renlys host?The greater part of his foot remains at Bitterbridge.
3170,Petyr,Varys,"Most of the lords who rode with Lord Renly to Storms End have gone over banner-and-blade to  Stannis, with all their chivalry.Led by the Florents, Id wager,"
3171,Alester,Varys,"You would win, my lord."
3172,Alester,Cortnay,"Many others followed.Many,but not all?Not all,Not Loras Tyrell, nor Randyll Tarly, nor Mathis Rowan."
3173,Loras,Stannis,"Its said the Knight of Flowers went mad when he saw  his kings body, and slew three of Renlys guards in his wrath, among them Emmon Cuy and Robar  Royce."
3174,Tyrion,Varys,"Ser Loras is likely making for Bitterbridge,His sister is there, Renlys queen, as well  as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless."
3175,Loras,Tyrion,"Many serve the lords who remained at Storms End, and those lords now belong to  Stannis."
3176,Loras,Tyrion,"There is a chance here, it seems to me."
3177,Cersei,Tyrion,"They may have sworn their swords to Stannis for  the moment, yet they cannot love the man, or they would have been his from the start.Is their love for us any greater?"
3178,Cersei,Tyrion,"Scarcely,They loved Renly, clearly, but Renly is slain."
3179,Joffrey,Stannis,"if we move quickly.What sort of reasons do you mean to give them?Gold reasons,"
3180,Petyr,Varys,"Sweet Petyr, surely you do not mean to suggest that these puissant lords  and noble knights could be bought like so many chickens in the market.Have you been to our markets of late, Lord Varys?"
3181,Petyr,Varys,"Youd find it easier to buy a  lord than a chicken, I daresay."
3182,Mace,Petyr,".Bribes might sway some of the lesser lords,but never Highgarden.True,The Knight of Flowers is the key there."
3183,Loras,Tyrion,"Win him, and Highgarden will be yours."
3184,Tyrion,Varys,It seems to me we should take a lesson from the late Lord Renly.
3185,Renly,Varys,With a marriage.
3186,Renly,Varys,You think to wed King Joffrey to Man gaery Tyrell.I do.
3187,Cersei,Petyr,"Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark,Marriage contracts can be broken.What advantage is there in wedding the king to the daughter of a  dead traitor?"
3188,Cersei,Petyr,"You might point out to His Grace that the Tyrells are much wealthier than the  Starks, and that Margaery is said to be lovely ."
3189,Petyr,Tyrion,"and beddable besides.Yes,Joffrey ought to like that well enough.My son is too young to care about such things.You think so?"
3190,Petyr,Tyrion,"Hes thirteen, Cersei.The same age at which I married.You shamed us all with that sorry episode.Joffrey is made of finer stuff.So fine that he had Ser Boros rip off Sansas gown.He was angry with the girl.He was angry with that cooks boy who spilled the soup last night as well, but he didnt strip him  naked.This was not a matter of some spilled soup-"
3191,Tyrion,Varys,"The dog is never far from his masters heels,but all men sleep. said Tyrion."
3192,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord, a suspicious man might think you  wished to find a time when Sandor Clegane was not protecting King Joffrey, the better to do the boy  some harm.Surely you know me better than that, Lord Varys,Why, all I want is for Joffrey to love  me."
3193,Joffrey,Petyr,"Doubtless you know your son better than I do,but regardless, theres still much to be said for a Tyrell marriage."
3194,Petyr,Varys,"The Stark girl brings Joffrey nothing but her body, sweet as that may be.Margaery  Tyrell brings fifty thousand swords and all the strength of Highgarden.Indeed."
3195,Petyr,Varys,"You have a mothers heart, and I know His  Grace loves his little sweetling."
3196,Joffrey,Varys,I say this offer must be made.
3197,Joffrey,Renly,You would not speak so if you were women.
3198,Renly,Tyrion,He will never consent.
3199,Renly,Tyrion,"When the king comes of age in three years, he may  give or withhold his consent as he pleases."
3200,Cersei,Tyrion,Leavings or no.
3201,Cersei,Tyrion,"Make your offer then, but gods save you all if Joffrey does not like this girl.Im so pleased we can agree,Now, which of us shall go to Bitterbridge?We must reach  Ser Loras with our offer before his blood can cool.You mean to send one of the council?I can scarcely expect the Knight of Flowers to treat with Bronn or Shagga, can I?The Tyrells are  proud."
3202,Cersei,Tyrion,Ser Jacelyn Bywater is nobly  born.Send him.
3203,Cersei,Tyrion,We need someone who can do more than repeat our words and fetch back a  reply.Our envoy must speak for king and council and settle the matter quickly.The Hand speaks with the kings voice.
3204,Cersei,Tyrion,"If we  send you, Tyrion, it will be as if Joffrey went himself.And who better, You wield words as skillfully as  Jaime wields a sword."
3205,Cersei,Tyrion,"You are too kind, sister, but it seems to me that a  boys mother is better fitted to arrange his marriage than any uncle.And you have a gift for winning  friends that I could never hope to match."
3206,Cersei,Tyrion,"Joffrey needs me at his side.Your Grace, my lord Hand,the king needs both of you here."
3207,Loras,Tyrion,"I am of the kings council, yet not the kings blood, so I would make a poor hostage."
3208,Petyr,Tyrion,"Mace Tyrell bears me no  enmity that I know of, and I flatter myself that I am not unskilled in negotiation."
3209,Petyr,Tyrion,"There is fighting  between here and Bitterbridge,And you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will  be dispatching his own shepherds to gather in his brothers wayward lambs.Ive never been frightened of shepherds."
3210,Stannis,Tyrion,"Still, I suppose an escort might  be in order.I can spare a hundred gold cloaks,Five hundred.Three hundred.And forty more-twenty knights with as many squires.If I arrive without a knightly tail, the Tyrells will  think me of small account."
3211,Stannis,Tyrion,"Agreed.Ill include Horror and Slobber in my party, and send them on to their lord father afterward."
3212,Paxter,Stannis,"We need Paxter Redwyne, hes Mace Tyrells oldest friend, and a great power in his own  right.And a traitor,The Arbor would have declared for Renly with all the rest,  except that Redwyne knew full well his whelps would suffer for it.Renly is dead, Your Grace,and neither Stannis nor Lord Paxter will have  forgotten how Redwyne galleys closed the sea during the siege of Storms End."
3213,Cersei,Tyrion,"The Others can keep his love, I want his swords and sails.Holding tight  to those twins is the best way to make certain that well have them."
3214,Cersei,Tyrion,"Then let us send Ser Hobber back to the Arbor and keep Ser Horas here.Lord  Paxter ought to be clever enough to riddle out the meaning of that, I should think."
3215,Petyr,Tyrion,Well want horses.
3216,Mace,Petyr,"A goodly supply of gold will also be needed,  for those gifts we spoke of earlier.Take as much as you require.If the city falls, Stannis will steal it all anyway.Ill want my commission in writing."
3217,Petyr,Tyrion,"It should be signed by Joffrey and  every member of this council, and bear all our seals."
3218,Petyr,Tyrion,Done.
3219,Petyr,Varys,"I remind you, theres a long road between here  and Bitterbridge.Ill be riding it before dawn breaks."
3220,Petyr,Varys,"I trust that on my return, the king will see that I  am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in his cause?"
3221,Petyr,Varys,"Joffrey is such a grateful sovereign, Im certain you will have no cause to complain, my  good brave lord."
3222,Petyr,Tyrion,"What do you want, Petyr?"
3223,Petyr,Tyrion,I shall need to give that some consideration.No doubt Ill  think of something.
3224,Petyr,Varys,We had best see to drawing up those documents.
3225,Petyr,Varys,And someone will need to wake Joffrey.
3226,Cortnay,Varys,"How comes your chain,  brother?"
3227,Cortnay,Varys,"Link by link, it grows longer."
3228,Cersei,Cortnay,"Stannis will never march north with Storms End untaken in his rear.Tyrion, I know we do not always agree on policy, but it seems to me that I was wrong about you."
3229,Cersei,Tyrion,You must forgive me if I have spoken to you harshly in the past.Must I?
3230,Cersei,Tyrion,"Sweet sister, you have said nothing that requires forgiveness.Today, you mean?"
3231,Bronn,Cersei,"Have I lost my wits, or did my sister just kiss me?"
3232,Bronn,Cersei,Was it so sweet?It was .
3233,Bronn,Cersei,unanticipated.
3234,Cersei,Tyrion,I  am trying to recall the last time she kissed me.
3235,Bronn,Tyrion,"Jaime had  dared her to do it.The womans finally taken note of your charms.No,No, the woman is hatching something."
3236,Bronn,Tyrion,You know I hate  surprises.
3237,Aeron,Benfred,"Robb will gut you, Greyjoy,Hell feed your turncloaks heart to his wolf, you piece of sheep dung."
3238,Benfred,Theon,"Now you must kill him.I have questions for him first,Puck your questions."
3239,Stygg,Werlag,"Youll choke on  them before you get any answers from me, craven.Turncloak."
3240,Aeron,Werlag,"When he spits on you, he spits on all of us."
3241,Aeron,Theon,"He must die.My father gave me the command here, Uncle.And sent me to counsel YOU."
3242,Aeron,Benfred,"Youll lose your head for this, Greyjoy.The crows will eat the jelly of your eyes."
3243,Benfred,Theon,The Others bugger your wet god.
3244,Benfred,Theon,"Stygg, silence him,"
3245,Aeron,Stygg,"No,He must be given to the god.The old way."
3246,Aeron,Theon,"Take him, then.You will come as well."
3247,Theon,Werlag,The offering should come from you.
3248,Theon,Werlag,"You are the priest, Uncle, I leave the god to you.Do me the  same kindness and leave the battles to me."
3249,Chett,Theon,"Wex, my bow and quiver."
3250,Balon,Theon,"No drunkards, I said, and no squabbles over  plunder."
3251,Balon,Theon,"Botley, silence him."
3252,Benfred,Theon,Anyone else  have a thirst?
3253,Benfred,Theon,Good.
3254,Dagmer,Theon,"The day is won,And yet you do not smile, boy.The living should smile, for the  dead cannot."
3255,Dagmer,Theon,"We could hear them singing,It was a good song,    and they sang it bravely.They sang better than they fought.Harps would have done them as much good as their lances did.How many men are lost?Of ours?"
3256,Dagmer,Theon,Todric.I killed him for getting drunk and fighting over loot.Some men are born to be killed.
3257,Dagmer,Theon,"You and I must talk, Uncle,"
3258,Dagmer,Theon,"Come onto my deck, then."
3259,Dagmer,Theon,We did not capture enough horses.
3260,Dagmer,Theon,Fewer men means more glory.What need do we have of horses?
3261,Dagmer,Theon,"Horses will only shit on our decks and get in our way.If we sailed, yes,I have another plan."
3262,Dagmer,Theon,"Your lord father commanded us to harry the coast, no more."
3263,Dagmer,Theon,"You are my fathers man.His best man, and always have been."
3264,Dagmer,Theon,"There is no man in the Iron  Islands half so skilled with spear or sword.You have been too long away, boy."
3265,Dagmer,Theon,"And Black Lorren and Qarl the Maid are near as dread.This Andrik may be a great fighter, but men do not fear him as they fear you.Aye, thats so,"
3266,Balon,Theon,"If I had a man like you in my service, I should not waste him on this childs business of harrying and  burning."
3267,Balon,Dagmer,Nor for his trueborn  son?
3268,Balon,Dagmer,"I know you too well, Theon."
3269,Balon,Dagmer,"Tis not me who feels wasted.By rights I should have my sisters command,You take this business too hard, boy."
3270,Brynden,Theon,"He learned to rely on her, and  she has never failed him.Nor have I."
3271,Dagmer,Theon,I was that close to crossing swords with the Kingslayer  himself.
3272,Dagmer,Theon,"Daryn Hornwood came between us, and died for it.Why do you tell me this?"
3273,Dagmer,Theon,It was me who put your first sword in your hand.I know  you are no craven.Does my father?
3274,Dagmer,Eddard,It is only .
3275,Dagmer,Eddard,"Theon, the Boy Wolf is your friend, and these Starks had you for ten years.I am no Stark."
3276,Dagmer,Eddard,"I am a Greyjoy, and I mean to be my fathers heir.How can  I do that unless I prove myself with some great deed? You are young."
3277,Dagmer,Eddard,"For now, we are  commanded to harry the Stony Shore.Let my uncle Aeron see to it.Ill give him six ships, all but Foamdrinker and Sea Bitch, and he can burn  and drown to his gods surfeit.The command was given you, not Aeron Damphair.So long as the harrying is done, what does it matter?"
3278,Dagmer,Theon,I have a task that only Dagmer Cleftjaw can accomplish.
3279,Dagmer,Theon,Tell me.
3280,Dagmer,Theon,"If my sister can take a  castle, so can P  "
3281,Dagmer,Theon,"But we have four times the wits, and five times the courage.Your father--will thank me, when I hand him his kingdom."
3282,Dagmer,Theon,"What would my part be in this scheme of yours, boy?"
3283,Theon,Torrhen,"To strike terror into the heart of the foe, as only one of your name could do."
3284,Benfred,Helman,"His uncle Leobald will remain, with some small garrison."
3285,Benfred,Helman,Make no secret of your approach.
3286,Benfred,Helman,"I want them to close their gates.Is this Torrhens Square a strong keep?Strong enough.The walls are stone, thirty feet high, with square towers at each corner and a square  keep within.Stone walls cannot be fired."
3287,Benfred,Helman,We do not have the numbers to storm even a  small castle.You will make camp outside their walls and set to building catapults and siege engines.That is not the Old Way.
3288,Benfred,Dagmer,There is no glory in starving out a foeman.Leobald will not know that.
3289,Dagmer,Theon,"Ser Rodrik is nothing if not dutiful.Any force he summons will be larger than mine,"
3290,Dagmer,Theon,This Torrhens Square will never fall.
3291,Dagmer,Theon,Its not Torrhens Square I mean to take.
3292,Arya,Weese,"It wont be no beating, oh, no."
3293,Arya,Weese,"Vargo Hoat his name is, and when he gets back hell  cut off your feet."
3294,Arya,Weasel,Ive got my eye on a plump crisp capon to sup on tonight.
3295,Arya,Jaqen,Youll like that.
3296,Amory,Harren,"One of Lorchs men, is he?"
3297,Amory,Harren,"He wont be going, then."
3298,Gregor,Tywin,"That goat Vargo Hoat is like to spit, him and Lorch  have always hated each other."
3299,Jaqen,Weese,"Weasel,Get to the armory and tell Lucan that Ser Lyonel notched his  sword in practice and needs a new one.Heres his mark."
3300,Arya,Weese,"Be quick  about it now, hes to ride with Ser Kevan Lannister."
3301,Arya,Hot,Which one is Lucan?
3302,Arya,Hot,Im to get a new sword for Ser  Lyonel.Never mind about Ser Lyonel.
3303,Arya,Hot,"Last night Hot Pie asked me if I heard  you yell Winterfell back at the holdfast, when we were all fighting on the wall.I never did!Yes you did.I heard you too.Everyone was yelling stuff,Hot Pie yelled hot pie.He must have yelled it a  hundred times.Its what you yelled that matters."
3304,Arya,Hot,"If he asks you, you better say the same.I will,"
3305,Gendry,Hot,"Ill get Lucan,"
3306,Arya,Weese,"This is too good for that oaf, and you tell him I said so,I will,"
3307,Arya,Harren,.
3308,Arya,Harren,"Hed run now if he knew what was  best for him.So you say, but might be the boy knows something we dont, maybe its us ought to be run ."
3309,Arya,Harren,.
3310,Amory,Weese,Weasel.
3311,Amory,Weese,Give me that.Took you long enough.
3312,Arya,Weese,Next time be quicker about it.
3313,Arya,Weese,You want another?
3314,Arya,Weese,Youll get it too.
3315,Arya,Weese,"Get  down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for him, but he better send his  lads to fetch them or Ill find someone wants em worse."
3316,Arya,Weese,"You run if you want to eat tonight,And dont be getting lost again, or I swear Ill beat you bloody."
3317,Amory,Rorge,"Yorens little cunt,Guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall,  dont we?"
3318,Arya,Rorge,Wheres your stick now?
3319,Arya,Rorge,Seems to me I promised to fuck you with  it.
3320,Arya,Rorge,"Not so brave now that Im not in chains, are  you?I saved you."
3321,Jaqen,Rorge,"Owe you another fucking for that, seems like.Did Yoren pump your cunny, or did he like that tight little  ass better?Im looking for Jaqen,Theres a message."
3322,Arya,Jaqen,The bathhouse.Get out of my way.
3323,Arya,Jaqen,"She steals in on little mice feet, but  a man hears,"
3324,Arya,Jaqen,The scuff of leather on stone sings loud as warhorns to a man with open ears.Clever girls go barefoot.I have a message.
3325,Arya,Jaqen,"Weese,"
3326,Arya,Jaqen,Tell his lordship a man shall attend him  at his leisure.
3327,Arya,Weese,"You tell Weese my lads got  duties to attend to, and you tell him hes a pox-ridden bastard too, and the seven hells will freeze over  before he gets another horn of my ale.Ill have them barrels within the hour or Lord Tywin will hear of it,  see if he dont."
3328,Arya,Jaqen,"Weasel, come here."
3329,Jaqen,Weese,I saw you looking at me.
3330,Jaqen,Weese,What did I tell you?
3331,Jaqen,Weese,"Keep those eyes to yourself, or next time Ill spoon one out and feed it to my bitch."
3332,Arya,Weese,"Youll mend that before you sleep,"
3333,Arya,Weese,"Weese,Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the  Sweetling,The Tickler and the Hound.Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei."
3334,Arya,Weese,"Dont none of you be thinking  how easy itll be here once mlord of Lannister is gone,The castle wont grow no smaller, I  promise you that, only now therell be fewer hands to tend to it.You lot of slugabeds are going to learn  what work is now, yes you are."
3335,Amabel,Weese,"Damnedest thing,He had that bitch dog since she was a pup.This place is cursed,Its Harrens ghost, thats what it is,Ill not sleep here another night, I swear  it."
3336,Chett,Jacelyn,"The Brynden is gone west with the king, my  lady."
3337,Brienne,Renly,"Where is Rivers now?His camp is two hours ride, my lady.Take us to him,"
3338,Brienne,Renly,"Have you come from Bitterbridge, my lady?"
3339,Catelyn,Renly,No.
3340,Catelyn,Wendel,"Lord Renly is slain,Wed hoped that tale was some Lannister lie, or-Would that it were."
3341,Catelyn,Wendel,Is there word from  Robb in the west?You have not heard?
3342,Catelyn,Wendel,"His Grace won a great victory at Oxcross.Ser  Stafford Lannister is dead, his host scattered."
3343,Catelyn,Martyn,"Well met, my lady.Your brother  charged us to keep an eye out for your party, and escort you back to Riverrun in all haste should we  come upon you."
3344,Catelyn,Stannis,"Is it my father?No, my lady.Lord Hoster is unchanged."
3345,Catelyn,Stannis,"It is only that we feared you might chance upon Lannister scouts.Lord Tywin has left  Harrenhal and marches west with all his power.Rise,"
3346,Robb,Stannis,"How long until Lord Tywin is upon us?Three days, perhaps four, it is hard to know.We have eyes out along all the roads, but it would be best  not to linger."
3347,Robb,Stafford,"Theres a singer come  to Riverrun, calls himself Rymund the Rhymer, hes made a song of the fight."
3348,Robb,Stafford,Wolf in the Night this Rymund calls it.
3349,Perwyn,Wendel,Nothings more like to  bring a Lannister running than a threat to his gold.How did the king ever take the Tooth?
3350,Perwyn,Wendel,"Thats a hard strong keep, and it commands the hill road. He never took it."
3351,Catelyn,Perwyn,The Lannisters in their watchtowers  got not so much a glimpse of them.
3352,Catelyn,Perwyn,"Theres some say that after the battle, the  king cut out Stafford Lannisters heart and fed it to the wolf.I would not believe such tales,My son is no savage.As you say, my lady."
3353,Catelyn,Eddard,The  Greatjons been heard to say that the old gods of the north sent those direwolves to your children.
3354,Brienne,Catelyn,"My lady, you are safely back among  your own now, a days ride from your brothers castle.Give me leave to go."
3355,Brienne,Catelyn,"If you left us, where would you go?"
3356,Brienne,Catelyn,"Back,To Storms End.Alone."
3357,Brienne,Catelyn,Yes.You mean to kill Stannis.
3358,Brienne,Catelyn,I swore a vow.
3359,Brienne,Catelyn,"You heard me.I did,"
3360,Brienne,Wendel,"Vows should be kept, I agree, but Stannis has a great host around him,  and his own guards sworn to keep him safe.I am not afraid of his guards."
3361,Brienne,Wendel,"I should never have fled.Is that what troubles you, that some fool might call you craven?"
3362,Brienne,Catelyn,"Renlys death was no fault    of youts.You served him valiantly, but when you seek to follow him into the earth, you serve no one."
3363,Brienne,Catelyn,"I know how hard it is-No one knows.Youre wrong,Every morning, when I wake, I remember that Eddard is gone.I  have no skill with swords, but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding to Kings Landing and  wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannisters white throat and squeezing until her face turns black."
3364,Brienne,Catelyn,"If you dream that, why would  you seek to hold me back?Is it because of what Stannis said at the parley?"
3365,Catelyn,Stannis,"I was taught  that good men must fight evil in this world, and Renlys death was evil beyond all doubt."
3366,Robert,Stannis,  
3367,Jaime,Robert,"The gods  dont care about men, no more than kings care about peasants.A good king does care.Lord Renly ."
3368,Robert,Stannis,".He is gone, Brienne,Stannis and Joffrey remain ."
3369,Brienne,Stannis,and so does my  son.He wouldnt .
3370,Brienne,Stannis,".I will tell you true, Brienne."
3371,Brienne,Stannis,"My son may be a king,  but I am no queen ... only a mother who would keep her children safe, however she could.I am not made to be a mother.I need to fight.Then fight ."
3372,Brienne,Catelyn,Renlys enemies are Robbs enemies as well.
3373,Brienne,Catelyn,"I do not know your son, my lady."
3374,Brienne,Catelyn,I  could serve you.If you would have me.
3375,Brienne,Catelyn,Why me?
3376,Brienne,Catelyn,You helped me.
3377,Brienne,Catelyn,"You were innocent.Even so, you did not have to do that."
3378,Brienne,Catelyn,I was nothing to you.
3379,Catelyn,Stannis,"Brienne, I have taken many wellborn ladies into my service over the years, but never one like  you.I am no battle commander.No, but you have courage."
3380,Catelyn,Stannis,That  you will not hold me back from Stannis.
3381,Renly,Robb,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
3382,Renly,Robb,"Then I am yours, my  lady."
3383,Catelyn,Eddard,"I swear it by the old gods and the new.And I vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and meat and mead at my table, and pledge  to ask no service of you that might bring you into dishonor."
3384,Catelyn,Eddard,Arise.
3385,Catelyn,Edmure,"Slow and careful  like, milady,Weve planted  iron spikes under the water, ysee, and theres caltrops scattered among them rocks there.Its the same  on all the fords, by your brothers command."
3386,Catelyn,Lucas,Tully!Stark!
3387,Perwyn,Wendel,"They have hanged some Lannisters,A pretty sight,Our friends have begun without us,"
3388,Edmure,Renly,"Cat, it is good to have you safely back."
3389,Catelyn,Renly,"And Lord Tywin is on the march as well.So I am told.How fares our father?One day he seems stronger, the next He shook his head.Hes  asked for you.I did not know what to tell him.I will go to him soon,Has there been word from Storms End since Renly died?Or from  Bitterbridge?"
3390,Catelyn,Cortnay,Nothing from Bitterbridge.
3391,Brienne,Edmure,"What boy would that be, do you  know?Edric Storm,Roberts bastard son."
3392,Brienne,Edmure,"Stannis has sworn that the garrison might go free, unharmed, provided  they yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into his hands, but Ser Cortnay will not  consent."
3393,Catelyn,Edmure,Did you send him an  answer?
3394,Edmure,Robin,"Why, when we have neither help nor hope to offer?And Stannis is no enemy  of ours."
3395,Renly,Robin,"My lady, can you tell us the manner of Lord Renlys death?The tales weve  heard have been queer.Cat,some say you killed Renly."
3396,Brienne,Catelyn,"My king was murdered,and not by Lady Catelyn. Catelyn told them."
3397,Desmond,Utherydes,"Ser Robin Ryger and Ser Desmond Grell.Honored,"
3398,Catelyn,Edmure,"Brienne was with Renly when he was killed, as was I,but we had no part in his death."
3399,Catelyn,Edmure,Who are these men youve hanged?
3400,Catelyn,Edmure,They came with Ser Cleos when he brought the queens answer to  our peace offer.
3401,Catelyn,Edmure,"Youve killed envoys?False envoys,They pledged me their peace and surrendered their weapons, so I  allowed them freedom of the castle, and for three nights they ate my meat and drank my mead whilst I  talked with Ser Cleos.On the fourth night, they tried to free the Kingslayer."
3402,Catelyn,Edmure,"That big  brute killed two guards with naught but those ham hands of his, caught them by the throats and smashed  their skulls together while that skinny lad beside him was opening Lannisters cell with a bit of wire, gods  curse him."
3403,Catelyn,Tyrion,"If  you ask me, the man sounded nothing like me, and yet the oafs were raising the portcullis all the same."
3404,Edmure,Tyrion,"How is it you caught them?Ah, as it happened, I was not in the castle."
3405,Edmure,Jaime,.You were whoring or wenching.Get on with the tale.
3406,Edmure,Jaime,"It was the hour before dawn, and I was only then  returning.When Long Lew saw my boat and recognized me, he finally thought to wonder who was  standing below barking commands, and raised a cry.Tell me the Kingslayer was retaken.Yes, though not easily."
3407,Jaime,Utherydes,"Hes down in the dark this time, chained hand and foot and bolted to the wall.And Cleos Frey?He swears he knew naught of the plot."
3408,Tywin,Utherydes,"I  put him in Jaimes old tower cell.You say he brought terms?If you can call them that.Youll like them no more than I did, I promise.Can we hope for no help from the south, Lady Stark?"
3409,Tywin,Utherydes,This charge of incest .
3410,Catelyn,Stannis,He has no choice but to make common cause with us.
3411,Catelyn,Stannis,Let us speak of these matters later.
3412,Catelyn,Edmure,"Who are all these  folk?My people,They were afraid."
3413,Desmond,Utherydes,"Can Robb be reached by raven?Hes in the field, my lady,The bird would have no way to find him."
3414,Desmond,Utherydes,"Before he left us, the young king instructed us to send you on to the Twins  upon your return, Lady Stark.He asks that you learn more of Lord Walders daughters, to help him  select his bride when the time comes.Well provide you with fresh mounts and provisions,Youll want to refresh  yourself before-Ill want to stay,"
3415,Edmure,Robb,"Boy,"
3416,Edmure,Jaime,"Cat,Lord Tywin is coming-He is making for the west, to defend his own lands. Edmure declared."
3417,Catelyn,Edmure,"We have nothing to gain and everything to lose by meeting Lord Tywin in the  field,The yard is not the place to discuss my battle plans.As you will.Where shall we go?"
3418,Chett,Jacelyn,The godswood.
3419,Edmure,Roose,"You do not have the strength to meet the Lannisters in the field,When all my strength is marshaled, I should have eight thousand foot and three thousand horse,Which means Lord Tywin will have near twice your numbers.Robbs won his battles against worse odds,"
3420,Edmure,Robb,   Edmure said stubbornly.
3421,Roose,Stevron,"And havent you taken two of his grandsons to be fostered at Winterfell?A ward can easily become a hostage, if need be."
3422,Helman,Stevron,"If were two hostages to the good, all the more reason Lord Walder dare not play us false."
3423,Helman,Stevron,"Ive commanded him to retake Harrenhal.Thats like to be a bloody business.Yes, but once the castle falls, Lord Tywin will have no safe retreat."
3424,Catelyn,Robb,"If he holds back, hell be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal, and when Robb  returns from the west we can finish him for good and all."
3425,Brynden,Edmure,"The plans a good one,Lord Tytos says so, and Lord jonos as well.When did  Blackwood and Bracken agree about anything that was not certain, I ask you?Be that as it may."
3426,Brynden,Eddard,Have you asked Father about this?Father is in no state to weigh strategies.
3427,Bran,Brandon,"This plan will work, Cat, youll see.I hope so, Edmure.I truly do."
3428,Chett,Hoster,Father.
3429,Chett,Hoster,I am returned.
3430,Chett,Hoster,"Youve come,Yes,Robb sent me south, but I hurried back.South ."
3431,Catelyn,Lysa,"have you forgiven me, child?"
3432,Catelyn,Lysa,"Youve done nothing that needs forgiveness, Father."
3433,Catelyn,Lysa,"It was best,Jons a good man, good ."
3434,Catelyn,Lysa,.
3435,Catelyn,Hoster,That stripling .
3436,Hoster,Vyman,.
3437,Hoster,Vyman,"Oh, gods forgive me, forgive me, forgive me."
3438,Hoster,Vyman,.
3439,Catelyn,Hoster,"Hell  sleep now, my lady,"
3440,Catelyn,Vyman,"My lady,"
3441,Catelyn,Lysa,"Ser Brynden would wish to be here.Yes,And the Lady Lysa as well, perhaps?Lysa will not come.If you wrote her yourself, perhaps  She wondered who Lysas "
3442,Catelyn,Utherydes,Eddard?
3443,Catelyn,Utherydes,"Ser Cleos brought him from Kings Landing, my lady.Take me to him,"
3444,Catelyn,Eddard,"I would look on him,Only the bones remain, my lady.I would look on him,"
3445,Catelyn,Utherydes,"That is not his sword.Ice was not returned to us, my lady,Only Lord Eddards bones.I suppose I must thank the queen for even that much.Thank the Imp, my lady.It was his doing."
3446,Catelyn,Utherydes,"I am grateful for your service, sisters,but I must lay  another task upon you."
3447,Catelyn,Utherydes,"Make certain the sisters have fresh horses, and aught else they need for the  journey,Hal Mollen will escort them back to Winterfell, it is his place as  captain of guards."
3448,Catelyn,Utherydes,"Now  leave me, all of you.I would be alone with Eddard tonight."
3449,Daenerys,Xaro,"Make way,make way, make way for the Mother of Dragons."
3450,Daenerys,Xaro,"I see a deep sadness written  upon your face, my light of love."
3451,Daenerys,Xaro,"Could it be the sadness of a lost dream?A dream delayed, no more."
3452,Wendel,Xaro,"Tell me the words of the Pureborn,Tell me what they said to sadden  the queen of my heart.They said no."
3453,Wendel,Xaro,"They said it with great  courtesy, to be sure, but under all the lovely words, it was still no.Did you flatter them?Shamelessly.Did you weep?The blood of the dragon does not weep,"
3454,Wendel,Xaro,You ought to have wept.
3455,Wendel,Xaro,"The men we bought, what did they say?Mathos said nothing."
3456,Wendel,Xaro,"The Exquisite refused me with the rest, but he  wept afterward., Alas, that Qartheen should be so faithless."
3457,Daenerys,Xaro,"Weep, weep, for the treachery of men."
3458,Wendel,Xaro,Suppose I sent Ser Jorah to demand the return of my gifts?
3459,Wendel,Xaro,"Suppose a Sorrowful Man came to my palace one night and killed you as you slept,I  am so sorry,"
3460,Daenerys,Xaro,It is wisely  said that it is easier to milk the Stone Cow of Faros than to wring gold from the Pureborn.
3461,Daenerys,Xaro,"Viserys sold my mothers crown, and men called him a beggar.I  shall keep this one, so men will call me a queen."
3462,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Make way, you Milk Men, make way for the Mother of Dragons,"
3463,Daenerys,Xaro,Your  dragon has a good nose.
3464,Daenerys,Xaro,The wine is ordinary.
3465,Daenerys,Xaro,"Let us take my  pleasure barge and go in search of it, you and I.The Arbor makes the best wine in the world,"
3466,Daenerys,Xaro,"Come with me to the Arbor, Xaro, and youll  have the finest vintages you ever tasted.But well need to go in a warship, not a pleasure barge.I have no warships."
3467,Daenerys,Xaro,"Many times I have told you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of  peace."
3468,Daenerys,Xaro,"I have not asked you to take up a sword, only to lend me your ships."
3469,Daenerys,Xaro,"Of trading ships I have a few, that is so."
3470,Daenerys,Xaro,"I grow poorer by the instant.Give me ships, and I will make you rich again.Marry me, bright light, and sail the ship of my heart.I cannot sleep at night for thinking of your beauty."
3471,Jorah,Xaro,"You speak sweetly, Xaro, but under your words I hear another no.This Iron Throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard.I cannot bear the thought of jagged  barbs cutting your sweet skin."
3472,Jorah,Xaro,"Let this be your kingdom, most exquisite of queens, and  let me be your king."
3473,Jorah,Xaro,"When Qarth begins to pall, we can  journey round Yi Ti and search for the dreaming city of the poets, to sip the wine of wisdom from a dead  mans skull.I mean to sail to Westeros, and drink the wine of vengeance from the skull of the Usurper."
3474,Chett,Xaro,"Will nothing turn you from this  madness?Nothing,If each of the Thirteen would lend me  ten ships-"
3475,Daenerys,Xaro,"Why should my sailors care who sits upon the throne of some  kingdom at the edge of the world?I will pay them to care.With what coin, sweet star of my heaven?With the gold the seekers bring.That you may do,but so much caring will cost dear."
3476,Daenerys,Xaro,"They will give you nothing but flattery and lies.The Spicers are dissemblers  and braggarts and the Brotherhood is full of pirates.Then I must heed Pyat Free, and go to the warlocks."
3477,Daenerys,Xaro,"Pyat Pree has blue lips, and it is truly said that blue lips speak only  lies."
3478,Daenerys,Xaro,"They have naught to give.I would not need to seek sorcerous help if my friend Xaro Xhoan Daxos would give me what I ask.I have given you my home and heart, do they mean nothing to you?"
3479,Aggo,Daenerys,"I have given you this palanquin of ebony and gold, and a matched set of bullocks to bear  it, one white as ivory and one black as jet, with horns inlaid with jewels.Yes,But it was ships and soldiers I wanted.Did I not give you an army, sweetest of women?A thousand knights, each in shining armor."
3480,Aggo,Daenerys,"A thousand lovely knights,but  not the sort my enemies need fear."
3481,Aggo,Daenerys,"Khaleesi, "
3482,Daenerys,Jhogo,What are they looking at?
3483,Daenerys,Jhogo,"A firemage, Khaleesi.I want to sec.Then you must."
3484,Daenerys,Jhogo,The Milk Men shun him.
3485,Daenerys,Jhogo,  
3486,Daenerys,Jhogo,"A fine trick,No trick,"
3487,Daenerys,Jhogo,"What mean you, my lady?Half a year gone, that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass."
3488,Daenerys,Jhogo,"He could walk  across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air, but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery  ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets."
3489,Daenerys,Jhogo,"And now?And now his powers grow, Khaleesi.And you are the cause of it.Me?"
3490,Daenerys,Jhogo,How could that be?
3491,Daenerys,Jhogo,"You are the Mother of Dragons, are  you not?She is, and no spawn of shadows may touch her."
3492,Daenerys,Jhogo,"You must leave this city soon, Daenerys Targaryen, or you will  never be permitted to leave it at all."
3493,Daenerys,Jhogo,Where would you have me go?
3494,Daenerys,Jhogo,"To go north, you must journey south."
3495,Daenerys,Rakharo,"To go forward you must go    back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow."
3496,Daenerys,Rakharo,Will the Asshaii give me an army?
3497,Daenerys,Rakharo,Will there be gold for me in Asshai?
3498,Daenerys,Rakharo,"What is there in Asshai that I will  not find in Qarth?Truth,"
3499,Aggo,Xaro,"Khaleesi, better a man should  swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows, who dare not show their face beneath the sun.It  is known.It is known,"
3500,Chett,Jacelyn,Your savages are wiser than they know.
3501,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Pureborn refused you?As you said they would.Come, sit, give me your counsel."
3502,Jhiqui,Jorah,"You will get no help in this city, Khaleesi."
3503,Jorah,Xaro,Each day I am more convinced of that than the day before.
3504,Jorah,Xaro,".He asked me to marry him again.Yes, and I know why."
3505,Drogo,Xaro,"He dreams of me, day and night."
3506,Drogo,Xaro,"Forgive me, my queen, but it is your dragons he dreams of.Xaro assures me that in Qarth, man and woman each retain their own property after they are wed.The  dragons are mine."
3507,Drogo,Xaro,"He tells it true as far as it goes, but theres one thing he failed to mention."
3508,Daenerys,Jorah,"One thing    only may be asked, but whatever is named may not be denied.One thing,And it may not be denied?With one dragon, Xaro Xhoan Daxos would rule this city, but one ship will further our cause but little."
3509,Daenerys,Jorah,"We passed through the  bazaar on our way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones,Quaithe was there."
3510,Daenerys,Jorah,"I would be glad to leave this city, if truth be told,But not for  Asshai.Where, then?East,I am half a world away from my kingdom even here.If I go any farther east I may never find my way  home to Westeros.If you go west, you risk your life.House Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities,Truer friends than Xaro or the  Pureborn.If you mean Illyrio Mopatis, I wonder.For sufficient gold, Illyrio would sell you as quickly as he would  a slave.My brother and I were guests in Illyrios manse for half a year.If he meant to sell us, he could have  done it then.He did sell you,To Khal Drogo."
3511,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Illyrio  protected us from the Usurpers knives, and he believed in my brothers cause.Illyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio."
3512,Daenerys,Illyrio,What do you truly know of him?I know that he gave me my dragon eggs.
3513,Daenerys,Illyrio,"If hed known they were like to hatch, hed would have sat on them himself."
3514,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Oh, I have no doubt of that, ser."
3515,Daenerys,Illyrio,"And I am no child now.Even if Illyrio is the friend you think him,he is not powerful enough to  enthrone you by himself, no more than he could your brother.He is rich,Not so rich as Xaro, perhaps, but rich enough to hire ships for me, and men as    well.Sellswords have their uses,but you will not win your fathers throne with  sweepings from the Free Cities. Daenerys protested."
3516,Daenerys,Drogo,"A few at least.And how am I to do that, if I go east as you counsel?"
3517,Daenerys,Drogo,"I do not know, Your Grace,"
3518,Daenerys,Drogo,What will they do when they learn of your dragons?
3519,Drogo,Myrcella,The comet led  me to Qarth for a reason.
3520,Drogo,Myrcella,"What else  remains, I ask myself?"
3521,Myrcella,Tyrion,"Come the morrow, you must go to  Pyat Pree."
3522,Stannis,Tyrion,"You know your orders, Captain.I do, my lord."
3523,Myrcella,Tyrion,"On no account are we to sail  within sight of Dragonstone.And if our foes should chance upon you nonetheless?If a single ship, we are to run them off or destroy them.If there are more, the Bold Wind will cleave to  the Seaswift to protect her while the rest of the fleet does battle."
3524,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Deliver my niece safely to Braavos, and there will be a knighthood waiting for you on your  return,"
3525,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You mew like a suckling babe,Princes arent supposed to cry.Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon,and the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on their cheeks after each had given the  other a mortal wound.Be quiet, or Ill have Ser Meryn give you a mortal wound,"
3526,Petyr,Tyrion,"If Petyr is dead, then Im a giant."
3527,Chett,Jacelyn,Joffrey!
3528,Cersei,Tyrion,"Leave her, Your Grace,shes beyond our help, poor thing."
3529,Cersei,Tyrion,Whore!
3530,Cersei,Tyrion,Kingslayers whore!Brotherfucker!
3531,Cersei,Tyrion,Brotherfucker brotherfucker  brotherfucker.
3532,Joffrey,Sansa,Who threw that?
3533,Joffrey,Sansa,I    want the man who threw that!
3534,Joffrey,Sansa,A hundred golden dragons to the man who gives him up.He was up there!
3535,Joffrey,Sansa,"Please, Your Grace, let him go,"
3536,Joffrey,Sansa,Bring me the man who flung that filth!
3537,Joffrey,Sandor,"Hell lick it off  me or Ill have his head.Dog, you bring him here!"
3538,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Clegane, leave off, the man is long fled.I want him!"
3539,Joffrey,Tyrion,"He was up there!  A tumult of sound drowned his last words, a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred that engulfed  them from all sides.someone screamed at Joffrey, Other voices flung calls  of  and  at the queen, while Tyrion was pelted with shouts of  and  Mixed in with the abuse, he heard a few cries of  and  of and even "
3540,Joffrey,Robb,Feed us!
3541,Joffrey,Robb,Bread!
3542,Joffrey,Robb,"We want bread,  bastard!"
3543,Brea,Tyrion,"Bread,Bread, bread!Back to the castle.Now"
3544,Mandon,Tyrion,Ride!
3545,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Traitors,Ill  have all their heads, Ill-"
3546,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You blind bloody fool.They were traitors,They called me names and attacked me!You set your dog on them!"
3547,Joffrey,Mandon,Damn you!
3548,Bronn,Tyrion,How many are still out there?
3549,Bronn,Tanda,"My daughter,Please, someone must go back for Lollys ."
3550,Bronn,Tanda,".Ser Preston is not returned,nor Aron Santagar.Nor Wet Nurse,"
3551,Joffrey,Tyrion,Wheres the Stark girl?
3552,Chett,Jacelyn,She was riding by me.
3553,Jaime,Mandon,"Ser Mandon, you were her shield."
3554,Cersei,Mandon,"When they mobbed the Hound, I thought first of the king.And rightly so,Boros, Meryn, go back and find the girl.And my daughter,Please, sers    Ser Boros did not look pleased at the prospect of leaving the safety of the castle.Your Grace,the sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob."
3555,Tanda,Tyrion,The Others take your fucking cloaks!
3556,Boros,Tyrion,"but find me Sansa Stark or I swear, Ill have Shagga split that  ugly head of yours in two to see if theres anything inside but black pudding."
3557,Boros,Bronn,"You would call me ugly, you?"
3558,Cersei,Tyrion,Stop it!
3559,Cersei,Joffrey,"Boros, youll do as youre bid, or well find someone else to wear that cloak.  "
3560,Sansa,Tyrion,"Are you hurt, Lady Sansa?"
3561,Sansa,Tyrion,They .
3562,Sandor,Sansa,.
3563,Sandor,Tanda,He cut off his arm.
3564,Sandor,Tanda,The little birds bleeding.Someone take her back to her cage and see to  that cut.
3565,Sandor,Tanda,"They did for Santagar, Four men held him down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone.I gutted one, not that it  did Ser Aron much good."
3566,Sandor,Tanda,My daughter-Never saw her.
3567,Sandor,Tanda,"Wheres my horse?If anythings  happened to that horse, someones going to pay.He was running with us for a time,but I dont know what became of him after that.Fire!"
3568,Sandor,Tyrion,"My lords, theres smoke in the city.Flea  Bottoms afire."
3569,Sandor,Tyrion,"Bronn, take as many men as you need  and see that the water wagons are not molested,"
3570,Sandor,Tyrion,"We can lose all of Flea Bottom if we must, but on no account must the fire reach the Guildhall of  the Alchemists, is that understood?Clegane, youll go with him."
3571,Meryn,Tyrion,"Ill go,though not by your command."
3572,Meryn,Tyrion,Each of you will ride escort to a herald.
3573,Cersei,Meryn,"Any man found on the streets after the last peal of the  evenfall bell will be killed.Our place is beside the king,"
3574,Boros,Cersei,"Your place is where my brother says it is,The Hand speaks  with the kings own voice, and disobedience is treason."
3575,Boros,Meryn,"Should we wear our cloaks, Your Grace?"
3576,Boros,Meryn,Go naked for all I care.
3577,Boros,Tyrion,Theyre like to have forgotten after  seeing the way you behaved out there in the street.
3578,Boros,Tyrion,"Find me Timett son of Timett.Stone Crows do not run squeaking after Burned Men,"
3579,Boros,Tyrion,Then find me Shagga.Shagga sleeps.
3580,Bronn,Tyrion,"Wake.Him.It is no easy thing to wake Shagga son of Dolf,His wrath is fearsome."
3581,Bronn,Tyrion,"Half the city is rioting, the other half is burning, and  Shagga lies snoring,Shagga mislikes your muddy water here, so he must drink your weak ale and sour wine, and after his  head hurts.I have Shae in a manse near the Iron Gate.I want you to go to her and keep her safe, whatever may  come."
3582,Bronn,Tyrion,Shagga will fetch  her here.Just see that no harm comes to her.
3583,Bronn,Tyrion,"This very night,  perhaps, or on the morrow for a certainty. "
3584,Tanda,Tyrion,"I want Tyrek found, alive or dead,Hes no more than a  boy."
3585,Tanda,Tyrion,"His father was always kind to me.Well find him.The septons crown as well.The Others can bugger each other with the septons crown, for all I care. When you named me to command the Watch, you told me you wanted plain truth, always.Somehow I have a feeling I am not going to like whatever youre about to say,We held the city today, my lord, but I make no promises for the morrow."
3586,Chett,Tyrion,"Where before you heard  only mutterings from the gutter, now theres open talk of treason in guildhalls and markets.Do you need more men?I do not trust half the men I have now."
3587,Aerys,Tyrion,"If it comes to battle, theyll not hold, I fear.I never expected them to,Once our walls are breeched, we are lost, Ive known that  from the start.My men are largely drawn from the smallfolk."
3588,Robert,Stannis,"in pot-shops  and winesinks and brothels, you hear these thingsand in the barracks and guardhalls as well, I fear.They hate my family, is that what you are telling me?Aye ."
3589,Robert,Stannis,"and will turn on them, if the chance comes.Me as well?Ask your eunuch.Im asking you."
3590,Stannis,Varys,"You most of all, my  lord.Most of all?"
3591,Stannis,Varys,"It was Joffrey who told them to eat their dead,  Joffrey who set his dog on them.How could they blame me?His Grace is but a boy."
3592,Janos,Pycelle,"Some even claim that you mean to seize the Iron  Throne for your own.Yes, and I am a monster besides, hideous and misshapen, never forget that."
3593,Pycelle,Tyrion,Ive heard enough.
3594,Pycelle,Tyrion,Leave me.
3595,Tyrion,Varys,Where have you been?
3596,Tyrion,Varys,"About the kings business, my sweet lord.Ah, yes, the king,My nephew is not fit to sit a privy, let alone the Iron Throne."
3597,Bronn,Varys,An apprentice must be taught his trade.Half the prentices on Reeking Lane could rule better than this king of yours.
3598,Bronn,Tyrion,"I dont recall giving you leave to finish my supper.You didnt look to be eating it,Citys starving, its a crime to  waste food.You have any wine?"
3599,Bronn,Tyrion,"You go too far,And you never go far enough."
3600,Bronn,Tyrion,Ever think how easy life  would be if the other one had been born first?
3601,Tommen,Tyrion,"The weepy one, Tommen.Seems like hed do whatever he was told, as a good king  should."
3602,Bronn,Cersei,"I could have your head off for saying that,Friends,quarreling will not serve us."
3603,Davos,Devan,"Since  Lord Renly died, he has been troubled by terrible nightmares,Maesters potions do not touch them.Only the Lady Melisandre can soothe him to sleep."
3604,Cortnay,Stannis,"Ser,"
3605,Cortnay,Stannis,My lord.
3606,Cortnay,Stannis,"It is customary to grant a king the style Your Grace,"
3607,Cortnay,Stannis,This is a notable company.
3608,Alester,Davos,"I fear I do  not know the lady.I am named Melisandre, ser."
3609,Davos,Stannis,"I serve your king, and the Lord of Light.I wish you well of them, my lady,but I bow to other gods, and a different  king.There is but one true king, and one true god,Are we here to dispute theology, my lord?Had I known, I would have brought a septon.You know full well why we are here,You have had a fortnight to consider my offer."
3610,Cortnay,Stannis,"One last time, ser, I command you to open your gates, and deliver me that which is mine by rights.And the terms?"
3611,Cortnay,Stannis,"Remain as before,I will pardon you for your treason, as I have pardoned these lords  you see behind me."
3612,Alester,Melisandre,"I will require your    horses and pack animals, however.And what of Edric Storm?My brothers bastard must be surrendered to me.Then my answer is still no, my lord."
3613,Alester,Melisandre,"May the Lord of Light protect you in your darkness, Ser Cortnay.May the Others bugger your Lord of Light,and wipe his arse with that rag you  bear."
3614,Alester,Melisandre,"Ser Cortnay, mind your tongue."
3615,Cortnay,Davos,   Ser Cortnay broke in.
3616,Bryce,Stannis,"No man here is a turncloak, ser."
3617,Mathis,Rowan,"He is the last of House Baratheon, Roberts heir and Renlys.If that is so, why is the Knight of Flowers not among you?"
3618,Randyll,Renly,"Where is Brienne  of Tarth, I ask you?That one?"
3619,Cortnay,Renly,She ran.
3620,Cortnay,Renly,"Hers was the hand that  slew the king.A lie,I knew Brienne when she was no more than a girl playing at her fathers feet  in Evenfall Hall, and I knew her still better when the Evenstar sent her here to Storms End.She loved  Renly Baratheon from the first moment she laid eyes on him, a blind man could see it.To be sure,"
3621,Cortnay,Renly,"No doubt she saw him as a danger to her son, and so removed him.It was Brienne,Ser Emmon Cuy swore as much before he died.You have my  oath on that, Ser Cortnay."
3622,Cortnay,Renly,And what is that worth?
3623,Cortnay,Renly,"If he is dead, how is it  you are not?"
3624,Renly,Stannis,"I might ask the same of you, ser."
3625,Cortnay,Stannis,"if I had such a cloak, I  would be ashamed to wear it."
3626,Cortnay,Stannis,"Be glad this is a parley, Penrose, or I would have your tongue for those words.And cast it in the same fire where you left your manhood?Enough!"
3627,Cortnay,Stannis,"The Lord of Light willed that my brother die for his treason.Who did the deed  matters not.Not to you, perhaps,I have heard your proposal, Lord Stannis.Now here is mine."
3628,Bryce,Cortnay,Single combat.
3629,Bryce,Cortnay,"Or if you fear to hazard your magic sword and royal skin against an old man, name  you a champion, and I shall do the same."
3630,Bryce,Stannis,"Either of these pups would do nicely, I should think."
3631,Bryce,Stannis,"I will take up the gage, if it please the king.As would I"
3632,Cortnay,Stannis,No.
3633,Cortnay,Stannis,"Is it the justice of your cause you doubt, my lord, or the strength of  your arm?Are you afraid Ill piss on your burning sword and put it out?Do you take me for an utter fool, ser?"
3634,Cortnay,Stannis,I have twenty thousand men.
3635,Cortnay,Stannis,Why would I choose single combat when my eventual victory is certain?
3636,Cortnay,Stannis,I give you fair warning.
3637,Cortnay,Stannis,"I will hang you for traitors, every one of you.As the gods will it.Bring on your storm, my lord-and recall, if you do, the name of this castle."
3638,Davos,Stannis,"If we storm these walls thousands will die,Better to hazard but a single life, surely?Our cause is righteous,  so the gods must surely bless our champions arms with victory."
3639,Chett,Jacelyn,
3640,Renly,Stannis,Garrison duty is for old men  and green boys.
3641,Renly,Stannis,"An easy victory, to be sure.And what glory, to win Storms End with a single  stroke!"
3642,Davos,Stannis,"You chatter like magpies, and with less sense.I will have quiet."
3643,Davos,Melisandre,Ser.Ride with me.
3644,Davos,Stannis,Your Grace.
3645,Davos,Stannis,"A smuggler must be a fair judge of men,What do you make of this Ser Cortnay  Penrose?A stubborn man,Hungry for death, I call it."
3646,Davos,Stannis,Single combat?
3647,Davos,Stannis,No  doubt he mistook me for Robert.More like he was desperate.What other hope does he have?None.
3648,Davos,Stannis,But how to do it quickly?
3649,Cortnay,Davos,Lord Alester  urges me to bring old Lord Penrose here.
3650,Cortnay,Davos,"You know the man, I believe?When I came as your envoy, Lord Penrose received me more courteously than most,He  is an old done man, sire.Sickly and failing.Florent would have him fail more visibly.In his sons sight, with a noose about his neck."
3651,Cortnay,Davos,"I  think that would be ill done, my liege."
3652,Davos,Stannis,"It would gain us nothing, and bring dishonor to our cause.What dishonor?"
3653,Davos,Stannis,"Would you have me spare the lives of traitors?You have spared the lives of those behind us.Do you scold me for that, smuggler?It is not my place."
3654,Davos,Stannis,"You esteem this Penrose more than you do my lords bannermen.Why?He keeps faith.A misplaced faith in a dead usurper.Yes,but still, he keeps faith.As those behind us do not?"
3655,Renly,Stannis,Last year they were Roberts men.
3656,Renly,Stannis,Whose will they be on the morrow?
3657,Renly,Stannis,"I told you, Melisandre,my Onion Knight tells me the truth.I see you know him well, Your Grace,Davos, I have missed you sorely,Aye, I have a tail of traitors, your nose does not  deceive you."
3658,Davos,Stannis,"You  have every right to reproach me, Ser Davos.You reproach yourself more than I ever could, Your Grace.  "
3659,Davos,Stannis,"Are they still there, Onion Knight?You have not lost them?No.,  I have often wondered.They remind me of what I was."
3660,Davos,Stannis,"They remind me of your justice, my liege.It was justice,A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good."
3661,Joffrey,Stannis,You were a hero and a smuggler.
3662,Joffrey,Robb,These pardoned lords  would do well to reflect on that.
3663,Robb,Stannis,But not forgotten.
3664,Renly,Stannis,"What do the smallfolk say of Renlys death? They grieve.Your brother was well loved.Fools love a fool,but I grieve for him as well.He was silent for a time, and then he said, "
3665,Renly,Stannis,  
3666,Renly,Stannis,"Selyse has given me horns, and tied a fools bells to the end of each."
3667,Renly,Stannis,"You would need to be as mad as Patchface to believe such a thing.That may be so, my liege ."
3668,Renly,Stannis,"but whether they believe the story or no, they delight to tell it."
3669,Renly,Stannis,"Robert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine, but I offer them pure cold water and they squint  in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes."
3670,Davos,Stannis,"If someone  said I had magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert, likely they would believe that as well.You cannot stop them talking, my liege,but when you take your vengeance on your  brothers true killers, the realm will know such tales for lies."
3671,Davos,Stannis,I have no doubt that Cersei had a hand in Roberts death.
3672,Davos,Stannis,"Aye, and for Eddard Stark and Jon Arryn as well.And for Renly?"
3673,Chett,Jacelyn,
3674,Devan,Stannis,And blood.
3675,Devan,Stannis,I was  still abed when he died.
3676,Davos,Devan,"I was in my tent when  Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean."
3677,Davos,Devan,I see.Renly offered me a peach.
3678,Davos,Stannis,"When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did his  words have some hidden meaning?"
3679,Davos,Stannis,Only Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit.
3680,Davos,Stannis,"I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my  brothers peach."
3681,Davos,Devan,"Cold water, cups for two."
3682,Davos,Melisandre,"My lady, I shall send for you when I require you.As the king commands."
3683,Davos,Stannis,"One day I may make you a lord,  smuggler."
3684,Davos,Devan,"It will mean you must suffer  through these councils, and feign interest in the braying of mules.Why do you have them, if they serve no purpose?The mules love the sound of their own braying, why else?"
3685,Davos,Devan,"But not today, I think-ah, heres your son with  our water."
3686,Davos,Devan,You were speaking of your  council?Let me tell you how it will go.
3687,Cortnay,Davos,Each one imagining he will be my  champion and win undying fame.
3688,Cortnay,Davos,"What would you have me do, smuggler?"
3689,Cortnay,Davos,Strike for Kings Landing at once.
3690,Cortnay,Davos,And leave Storms End untaken?Ser Cortnay does not have the power to harm you.
3691,Davos,Tywin,".You have a passing clever father, Devan,He makes me  wish I had more smugglers in my service."
3692,Davos,Doran,The castle must fall.
3693,Davos,Doran,"Aye, and quickly."
3694,Salladhor,Stannis,"I fear that Ser Loras Tyrell reached  Bitterbridge before my envoys, and took that host for his own.All the more reason to take Kings Landing as soon as we may.  "
3695,Salladhor,Stannis,"His head is full of dreams of the treasure he  fancies lies under the Red Keep, so let us hear no more of Salladhor Saan.The day I need military  counsel from a Lysene brigand is the day I put off my crown and take the black."
3696,Cortnay,Davos,"Are you here to serve me, smuggler?Or to vex me with arguments?I am yours,Then hear me."
3697,Cortnay,Davos,"Should some ill chance strike down Penrose, command of Storms End would pass to this  stripling, and his cousins believe he would accept my terms and yield up the castle.I remember another stripling who was given command of Storms End.He could not have been much  more than twenty.Lord Meadows is not as stonehead stubborn as I was.Stubborn or craven, what does it matter?Ser Cortnay Penrose seemed hale and hearty to me.So did my brother, the day before his death.The night is dark and full of terrors, Davos."
3698,Cortnay,Davos,"My lord, I do not understand you.I do not require your understanding."
3699,Devan,Stannis,"He will not die in  knightly combat, needless to say."
3700,Devan,Renly,Her  flames do not lie.
3701,Renly,Selyse,"Lord  Velaryon and your friend Salladhor Saan would have had me sail against Joffrey, but  Melisandre told me that if I went to Storms End, I would win the best part of my brothers power, and  she was right.B-but,Lord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to the castle.He  was marching toward Kings Landing before, against the Lannisters, he would have-Was, would have, what is that?"
3702,Davos,Stannis,"Had I met my brother there, it might have been me who died in  place of him.Or you might have joined your strength to his to bring down the Lannisters,Why  not that?"
3703,Davos,Stannis,both cannot be true.
3704,Davos,Stannis,"There you err, Onion Knight."
3705,Davos,Melisandre,You do not love the woman.
3706,Beth,Davos,while she serves.Serves how?
3707,Beth,Davos,As needed.
3708,Beth,Davos,And you?I .
3709,Beth,Davos,.
3710,Beth,Davos,I am yours to command.What would you have me do?Nothing you have not done before.
3711,Beth,Davos,Can you do that?Yes.Tonight?
3712,Beth,Davos,You will need a small boat.
3713,Beth,Davos,No one must know what you  do.
3714,Davos,Stannis,"You are quiet,"
3715,Cortnay,Davos,"Let Ser Cortnay keep the bastard boy and he  may well yield.I must have the boy, Davos."
3716,Cortnay,Davos,Melisandre has seen that in the flames as well.
3717,Cortnay,Davos,"Storms End holds no knight who can match Ser Guyard or Lord  Caron, or any of a hundred others sworn to your service."
3718,Cortnay,Davos,Even if it means his own life? 
3719,Cortnay,Davos,More like he plans some treachery.
3720,Cortnay,Davos,"The flames do  not lie, Davos."
3721,Davos,Melisandre,"I can smell  the fear on you, ser knight,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors."
3722,Chett,Davos,Would that you were an onion.
3723,Chett,Davos,Is it me you fear?Or what we do?What you do.Ill have no part of it.Your hand raised the sail.Your hand holds the tiller.
3724,Chett,Davos,"Are you a good man, Davos Seaworth?"
3725,Chett,Davos,"I am a man,I am kind to my wife, but I have known other  women."
3726,Davos,Melisandre,"Good and bad.A grey man,Neither white nor black, but partaking of both.Is that what you are, Ser  Davos?What if I am?It seems to me that most men are grey.If half of an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion.A man is good, or he is evil."
3727,Davos,Melisandre,"Watch your head, my lady."
3728,Davos,Melisandre,"You speak of men and  onions,What of women?"
3729,Davos,Melisandre,"Are you good or evil,  my lady?"
3730,Davos,Melisandre,"Oh, good."
3731,Davos,Melisandre,"A champion of light and    life.Yet you mean to kill a man tonight,As you killed Maester Cressen.Your maester poisoned himself.He meant to poison me, but I was protected by a greater power and  he was not.And Renly Baratheon?Who was it who killed him?"
3732,Davos,Melisandre,Not LLiar.
3733,Davos,Melisandre,"You are lost in darkness and confusion, Ser Davos.And a good thing."
3734,Davos,Melisandre,Feel how cold the wind is?
3735,Davos,Melisandre,"Yet that will blind them, so they  will not see us pass."
3736,Davos,Melisandre,"The god of darkness protects us now, my lady.Even you."
3737,Davos,Melisandre,"Speak not that name, ser."
3738,Chett,Davos,"Have it your way.His way, rather."
3739,Chett,Davos,Help me bring in the sail.Ill row us the rest of the way.
3740,Chett,Davos,"Who rowed you to Renly?There was no need,He was unprotected."
3741,Chett,Davos,"Dark walls that no shadow can pass-ancient, forgotten, yet still in  place.Shadow?"
3742,Chett,Davos,"A shadow is a thing of darkness.You are more ignorant than a child, ser knight."
3743,Chett,Davos,The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows.
3744,Davos,Melisandre,"This is as far as we go, unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for us."
3745,Davos,Melisandre,Have we passed within the walls?Yes.
3746,Davos,Melisandre,And the bars are  too closely spaced for even a child to squeeze through.
3747,Davos,Melisandre,"Gods preserve us,"
3748,Jon,Ottyn,One blast?
3749,Jon,Ottyn,"One, my lord,Brothers returning."
3750,Jon,Ottyn,The Halfhand.And past time.
3751,Jon,Ottyn,"See  that theres hot food for the men and fodder for the horses.Ill see Qhorin at once.Ill bring him, my lord."
3752,Small,Thoren,"Mance  Rayder knows he must battle the Watch,but he will never look for us so far  north. Ser Ottyn had objected."
3753,Ottyn,Small,"Without Qhorin, we are only two hundred.Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep, ser, and see what happens,There are goats among these sheep, Thoren,Aye, and maybe a few lions."
3754,Small,Thoren,".I know them as well as you do, Buckwell,And I mean to have  their heads, every one."
3755,Small,Thoren,We will sweep over them and send them howling back to  their hovels.
3756,Benjen,Jon,I heard the horn.Has your uncle come back?Its only the men from the Shadow Tower.
3757,Benjen,Jon,Samwell I have to go.
3758,Jon,Qhorin,Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once.Ill show you to his tent.
3759,Jon,Qhorin,"My men are hungry, and our horses require tending.Theyll all be seen to."
3760,Eddard,Jon,"You are Jon Snow.You have  your fathers look.Did you know him, my lord?I am no lordling."
3761,Eddard,Jon,And his father before  him.
3762,Jon,Qhorin,Lord Rickard died before I was born.He was a friend to the Watch.
3763,Jon,Qhorin,It is said that a direwolf runs with you.Ghost should be back by dawn.He hunts at night.
3764,Jon,Qhorin,"I had begun to fear for you.Did you  meet with trouble? We met with Alfyn Crowkiller.Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall, and we chanced on him  returning."
3765,Jon,Qhorin,"Alfyn will trouble the realm no longer, but some of his company  escaped us.We hunted down as many as we could, but it may be that a few will win back to the  mountains.And the cost?Four brothers dead."
3766,Jon,Qhorin,"One died  quickly from his wounds, but the other lived long enough to be questioned.Best talk of this inside."
3767,Jon,Qhorin,Or would you prefer hot spiced wine?Boiled water will suffice.An egg and a bite of bacon.As you wish.
3768,Jon,Qhorin,"I envy those eggs,I could do  with a bit of boiling about now."
3769,Jon,Qhorin,"It was a poor vintage, though, and his corpse did not improve it.You drank the wine?Its an awful thing to find a brother dead.Youd have need of a drink as well, Lord Snow."
3770,Jon,Lark,"Its an old mans folly, this ranging,Well find nothing but our  graves in them mountains.Theres giants in the Frostfangs, and wargs, and worse things,Ill not be going there, I promise you.The Old Bears not like to give you a choice.Might be we wont give him one,"
3771,Jon,Samwell,"Make a drinking horn out of it,and every time you take  a drink youll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men."
3772,Jon,Qhorin,"You want to serve, or shall I?"
3773,Jon,Qhorin,Ill do it.
3774,Qhorin,Rattleshirt,.
3775,Chett,Jacelyn, he was saying.
3776,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a little longer.True or false, the Wall must be warned,And the king.Which king?All of them."
3777,Jon,Rattleshirt,"If they would claim the realm, let them defend it."
3778,Jon,Rattleshirt,"These kings will do what  they will,Likely it will be little enough."
3779,Jon,Mance,The  Starks must rally the north.Yes.To be sure.
3780,Jon,Mance,"Ser  Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies from Kings Landing, we can hope."
3781,Jon,Mance,.Greyguard has largely collapsed.
3782,Jon,Mance,"With daily patrols along the battlements between.Patrols, aye."
3783,Mance,Qhorin,A breach.
3784,Mance,Qhorin,"What?They do not plan to climb the Wall nor to burrow beneath it, my lord.They plan to break it.The Wall is seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that it would take a hundred men a year to  cut through it with picks and axes.Even so."
3785,Mance,Qhorin,How?How else?Sorcery.
3786,Mance,Qhorin,"Why else would Mance choose to gather his strength in  the Frostfangs?Bleak and hard they are, and a long weary march from the Wall.Id hoped he chose the mountains to hide his muster from the eyes of my rangers.Perhaps,"
3787,Jon,Qhorin,He is searching for something he needs.Something?
3788,Jon,Qhorin,Some power.
3789,Jon,Qhorin,I doubt he knew in any case.
3790,Jarman,Jon,"Some power,I must know.Then you must send scouts into the mountains.I am loath to risk more men.We can only die."
3791,Small,Thoren,"To learn what waits in  those mountains.Waits,Waits."
3792,Mance,Small,"I see no other choice,"
3793,Mance,Small,".Someone will come down out of the Frostfangs, my lord,If us, all well and good."
3794,Mance,Small,"This is a strong place.Not that strong,Belike we shall all die, then."
3795,Jon,Qhorin,"Our lives will be coin well spent.Die,Die, die, die, die."
3796,Chett,Jacelyn,May the gods forgive me.
3797,Jon,Qhorin,Very well.I  choose Jon Snow.
3798,Jon,Qhorin,He is hardly more than a boy.
3799,Jon,Qhorin,"Not even a ranger.Tollett can care for you as well, my lord."
3800,Jon,Qhorin,The old gods  are still strong beyond the Wall.
3801,Jon,Qhorin,and the Starks.
3802,Jon,Qhorin,"What is your will in this?To go,"
3803,Jon,Qhorin,I thought it might be.
3804,Jon,Qhorin,"We ride at noon,Best find that wolf of yours."
3805,Lancel,Tyrion,The queen intends to send Prince Tornmen away.
3806,Lancel,Tyrion,"Lord Gyles will  take him to Rosby, and conceal him there in the guise of a page.They plan to darken his hair and tell  everyone that he is the son of a hedge knight.Is it the mob she fears?Or me?Both,Ah."
3807,Lancel,Varys,"You have my thanks, ser.Will you grant me the boon I asked of you?Perhaps."
3808,Bronn,Tyrion,Take this to Ser  Jacelyn Bywater.
3809,Bronn,Tyrion,What does it say?
3810,Bronn,Tyrion,That hes to take fifty of his best swords and scout the roseroad.
3811,Bronn,Tyrion,"Stannis is more like to come up the kingsroad.Oh, I know."
3812,Gyles,Tyrion,"Prince Tommen may be dressed as a page.You want the boy brought back, is that it?No.I want him taken on to the castle."
3813,Joffrey,Stannis,Lord Gyles is too sickly to run and too  craven to fight.
3814,Joffrey,Tyrion,Ask him how he likes the sound of Lord Bywater.Lord Bronn would sound better.
3815,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Ill dandle him on my knee  and sing him nursery songs if theres a lordship in it.I need you here,"
3816,Bronn,Tyrion,"What should the new lord do with the old one?Whatever he pleases, so long as he remembers to feed him.I dont want him dying."
3817,Bronn,Tyrion,My sister will send one of the Kingsguard with the prince.
3818,Bronn,Tyrion,"Sandor is Joffreys dog, he wont leave him.Ironhands gold cloaks  should be able to handle the others easy enough.If it comes to killing, tell Ser Jacelyn I wont have it done in front of Tommen."
3819,Bronn,Tyrion,"My nephew is tenderhearted.Are you certain hes a Lannister?Im certain of nothing but winter and battle,Come.Im riding with you part of the way.Chatayas?You know me too well."
3820,Cersei,Tyrion,"Bugger it all,"
3821,Shae,Tyrion,Who is that?
3822,Shae,Tyrion,Fatbelly singer.
3823,Shae,Tyrion,"My lord Hand.An honor, an  honor.Mlord."
3824,Symon,Tyrion,"Sweetling,And who is this?"
3825,Symon,Tyrion,"I am called Symon Silver Tongue, my lord.   Tyrion finished."
3826,Symon,Tyrion,.
3827,Symon,Tyrion,"My lord Hand, I said, an  honor ."
3828,Symon,Tyrion,.A wiser man would have pretended not to recognize me.
3829,Shae,Tyrion,"You know of my sweet Shae, you know where she  dwells, you know that I visit by night alone.I swear, Ill tell no one ."
3830,Shae,Tyrion,.On that much we agree.Good night to you.
3831,Shae,Tyrion,"My singer may never sing again now,Youve scared the voice from him.A little fear will help him reach those high notes."
3832,Shae,Tyrion,"You wont hurt him, will you?"
3833,Shae,Tyrion,"His songs cheer me on the nights you dont come.Would that I could come every night,How well does he sing?Better than some.Not so good as others."
3834,Shae,Tyrion,"Keep him if you like, but keep him close.I wont have him wandering the city  spreading tales in pot-shops.He wont-"
3835,Shae,Tyrion,"Lord Varys has come to see you,"
3836,Shae,Tyrion,To be sure.How is it you knew him  when I did not?
3837,Tyrion,Varys,"Its still him.Only dressed different.A different look, a different smell, a different way of walking,Most men would be  deceived.And most women, maybe."
3838,Tyrion,Varys,"A whore learns to see the man, not his garb, or she turns up  dead in an alley."
3839,Tyrion,Varys,"Shae, would you  bring us some wine?"
3840,Shae,Varys,"I almost fear to tell you why Ive come, my lord,I bring dire  tidings.You ought to dress in black feathers, Varys, youre as bad an omen as any raven."
3841,Cortnay,Tyrion,Is it Jaime?
3842,Cortnay,Tyrion,"No, my lord."
3843,Cortnay,Tyrion,Storms End has opened its gates to  Stannis Baratheon.
3844,Tyrion,Varys,Damn him!
3845,Tyrion,Varys,"Who, my lord?Ser Cortnay or Lord Stannis?Both of them."
3846,Robb,Varys,How did this happen?
3847,Shae,Varys,"My lord, must we trouble your sweet ladys sleep with such grim and bloody  talk?A lady might be afraid,but Im not.You should be,With Storms End fallen, Stannis will soon turn his attention toward  Kings Landing."
3848,Shae,Tyrion,"Lord Varys, give us a moment, and Ill ride  back to the castle with you.I shall wait in the stables."
3849,Shae,Tyrion,"You are not safe here.I have my walls, and the guards you gave me.Sellswords,They like my gold well enough, but will they die for it?"
3850,Lollys,Tyrion,"What do you think they would do if they got their hands on the Hands lady?The Hands whore, you mean?"
3851,Lollys,Tyrion,"Though I would  be your lady, mlord."
3852,Cersei,Tyrion,and I vow Id never shame you.
3853,Cersei,Tyrion,"A sweet dream, Shae."
3854,Cersei,Tyrion,It can never  be.Because of the queen?Im not afraid of her either.I am.Then kill her and be done with it.Its not as if there was any love between you.
3855,Cersei,Tyrion,Shes my sister.
3856,Cersei,Shae,"I can  scheme with any man in the Seven Kingdoms, but the gods have not equipped me to face Jaime with  swords in hand.The Young Wolf and Lord Stannis have swords and they dont scare you."
3857,Cersei,Shae,"Against them I have all the power of House Lannister.Against Jaime or  my father, I have no more than a twisted back and a pair of stunted legs.You have me."
3858,Shae,Tyrion,Not  now.
3859,Shae,Tyrion,I think I might be able to bring you into the  castle kitchens.
3860,Shae,Tyrion,"The kitchens?Yes.If I act through Varys, no one will be the wiser."
3861,Shae,Tyrion,"Mlord, Id poison you.Every man whos tasted my cooking has told me what a good  whore I am.The Red Keep has sufficient cooks."
3862,Shae,Tyrion,"Youd need to pose as a scullion.A pot girl,in scratchy brown roughspun. Tyrion said."
3863,Shae,Tyrion,He still wants me.
3864,Shae,Tyrion,"Would you like to fuck your kitchen wench,  mlord?"
3865,Shae,Tyrion,.Stop it.
3866,Shae,Tyrion,"This is not  the time for bed sport, Shae.Your life may be at stake."
3867,Shae,Tyrion,"If Ive displeased nilord, I never meant it, only ."
3868,Shae,Tyrion,couldnt you just give me more  guards?
3869,Shae,Tyrion,"Your  gems can be replaced, and new gowns can be sewn twice as lovely as the old."
3870,Shae,Tyrion,I want  you there.In the kitchens.
3871,Shae,Tyrion,"Scouring pots.For a short while.My father made me his kitchen wench,That was why I ran off.You told me you ran off because your father made you his whore,That too.I didnt like scouring his pots no more than I liked his cock in me."
3872,Shae,Tyrion,Why  cant you keep me in your tower?Half the lords at court keep bedwarmers.I was expressly forbidden to take you to court.By your stupid father.
3873,Cersei,Shae,Youre old enough to keep all the whores you want.
3874,Cersei,Shae,"What could he do, spank you?"
3875,Cersei,Shae,"Damn you,Damn you."
3876,Cersei,Shae,Not  you.
3877,Cersei,Shae,"Beg pardon,  mlord,I never meant to be impudent."
3878,Cersei,Shae,"That was ill done,On both our parts.Shae, you do not understand."
3879,Cersei,Shae,"When I was thirteen, I wed a crofters daughter."
3880,Cersei,Shae,My bride was a whore Jaime had hired to give me my first taste of manhood.
3881,Cersei,Shae,"To drive the lesson home, Lord Tywin gave my wife to a barracks of  his guardsmen to use as they pleased, and commanded me to watch."
3882,Cersei,Shae,"So you will remember  her as she truly is,After he was done with her, my father had the marriage undone.It was as if we had never  been wed, the septons said."
3883,Shae,Varys,"Please, lets have no more talk of the Tower of the  Hand."
3884,Shae,Varys,"Once were done with Stannis, youll have another    manse, and silks as soft as your hands."
3885,Shae,Varys,"My hands wont be soft if I  clean ovens and scrape plates all day.Will you still want them touching you when theyre all red and raw  and cracked from hot water and lye soap?More than ever,When I look at them, theyll remind me how brave you were."
3886,Shae,Varys,"I am yours to command, mlord."
3887,Tyrion,Varys,I will send for you.
3888,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Varys,I need to bring Shae into the castle without Cersei  becoming aware."
3889,Pycelle,Tyrion,"I will do as my lord commands, of course ."
3890,Tyrion,Varys,"and lie, and lie."
3891,Tyrion,Varys,And such a pretty young kitchen wench will incite lust as well as curiosity.
3892,Tyrion,Varys,"Bakers will  knead her breasts with floured hands.Id sooner have her fondled than stabbed,"
3893,Tanda,Tyrion,And the daughter would require a new  maidservant.I see.
3894,Lollys,Varys,"Lollys is timid and trusting,She will accept any tale she is told."
3895,Shae,Tyrion,"but conveniently close,    should you have need of comfort.The Tower of the Hand is watched, you know as well as L Cersei would be certain to grow curious if  Lollyss bedmaid starting paying me calls.I might be able to slip the child into your bedchamber unseen.Chatayas is not the only house to boast a  hidden door.A secret access?To my chambers?"
3896,Maegor,Tyrion,"Yes, I suppose there would be."
3897,Maegor,Tyrion,"My  bedchamber?My friend, you would not force me to reveal all my little secrets, would you?Henceforth think of them as our little secrets, Varys."
3898,Maegor,Tyrion,Assuming you are on my side .
3899,Maegor,Tyrion,".Can you doubt it?Why no, I trust you implicitly."
3900,Tyrion,Varys,"I trust you like one of  my own blood, in truth.Now tell me how Cortnay Penrose died.It is said that he threw himself from a tower.Threw himself?No, I will not believe that!His guards saw no man enter his chambers, nor did they find any within afterward.Then the killer entered earlier and hid under the bed,"
3901,Tyrion,Varys,"Whos to say they did not do the thing themselves?Doubtless you are right, my lord."
3902,Tyrion,Varys,"But you do not think so?How was it done,then?"
3903,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord, do you believe in the old powers?Magic, you mean?"
3904,Tyrion,Varys,"Bloodspells, curses, shapeshifting, those sorts of things?"
3905,Tyrion,Varys,Do you mean to suggest that Ser Cortnay was magicked to his death?Ser Cortnay had challenged Lord Stannis to single combat on the morning he died.
3906,Tyrion,Varys,"Then there is the matter of Lord Renlys mysterious and most fortuitous  murder, even as his battle lines were forming up to sweep his brother from the field."
3907,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord, you once asked me how it was that I was cut.I recall,You did not want to talk of it.Nor do I, but ."
3908,Tyrion,Varys,.
3909,Tyrion,Varys,I was an orphan boy apprenticed to a traveling folly.
3910,Tyrion,Varys,"One day at Myr, a certain man came to our folly."
3911,Chett,Jacelyn,The mummers had sailed by the time he was done with me.
3912,Chett,Tyrion,"Yet I still dream of that night, my lord."
3913,Chett,Tyrion,"If Lord Stannis is one such, I mean to see him dead."
3914,Chett,Jacelyn,A harrowing tale.
3915,Chett,Tyrion,"You are sorry, but you do not believe me."
3916,Renly,Tyrion,"Ive told myself as much a thousand times.I believe in steel swords, gold coins, and mens wits,And I believe there once were  dragons.Ive seen their skulls, after all.Let us hope that is the worst thing you ever see, my lord.On that we agree."
3917,Renly,Tyrion,"And for Ser Cortnays death, well, we know Stannis hired sellsails  from the Free Cities.Perhaps he bought himself a skilled assassin as well.A very skilled assassin.There are such.I used to dream that one day Id be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet  sister.Regardless of how Ser Cortnay died,he is dead, the castle fallen."
3918,Renly,Tyrion,None.A pity.
3919,Renly,Tyrion,"What news    of my father?If Lord Tywin has won across the Red Fork, no word has reached me yet."
3920,Renly,Tyrion,The Oakheart leaf and the Rowan tree have been seen north of the  Mander.No word from Petyr?Perhaps he never reached Bitterbridge.
3921,Tyrion,Varys,Lord Caswell has shut himself up in his  castle.
3922,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord?Dont you see the jest, Lord Varys?"
3923,Tyrion,Varys,"Storms End is fallen and Stannis is coming with fire and steel and the gods alone know what dark  powers, and the good folk dont have Jaime to protect them, nor Robert nor Renly nor Rhaegar nor their  precious Knight of Flowers.Only me, the one they hate."
3924,Tyrion,Varys,"The dwarf, the evil  counselor, the twisted little monkey demon.Im all that stands between them and chaos."
3925,Tyrion,Varys,Tell Father I have gone to make him proud.
3926,Catelyn,Edmure,"He was always proud of you, Edmure."
3927,Catelyn,Edmure,Believe that.I mean to give him better reason than mere birth.
3928,Brienne,Catelyn,"What shall we do now,  my lady?Our duty."
3929,Brienne,Catelyn,"Come on, come on,my sword is hungry still. "
3930,Brienne,Catelyn,"Fighting is better than this waiting,You dont feel so helpless when you fight."
3931,Brienne,Catelyn,"When youre armored its hard for anyone to hurt you.Knights die in battle,"
3932,Brienne,Catelyn,As ladies die in childbed.No one sings songs  about them.Children are a battle of a different sort.
3933,Brienne,Catelyn,"A battle without banners or  warhorns, but no less fierce."
3934,Brienne,Catelyn,".I never knew my mother,My father had ladies ."
3935,Brienne,Catelyn,".Those were no ladies,As hard as birth can be, Brienne, what comes after is even  harder."
3936,Brienne,Catelyn,"Would that there were five of me, one for each  child, so I might keep them all safe.And who would keep you safe, my lady?"
3937,Brienne,Catelyn,"Why, the men of my House."
3938,Brienne,Vyman,"but while they are away from me, I  suppose you must fill their place, Brienne."
3939,Brienne,Vyman,"I shall try, my lady."
3940,Cortnay,Stannis,or whoever now holds  Riverrun.
3941,Catelyn,Vyman,"Save Cortnay Penrose,"
3942,Catelyn,Vyman,"Robb should know of this at once,Do we know where he is?At last word he was marching toward the Crag, the seat of House Westerling,If I dispatched a raven to Ashemark, it may be that they could send a rider after him.Do so."
3943,Brienne,Catelyn,"Lord Meadows says nothing of Roberts  bastard,I suppose he yielded the boy with the rest, though I confess, I do not  understand why Stannis wanted him so badly.Perhaps he fears the boys claim.A bastards claim?"
3944,Brienne,Catelyn,"what does this child look like?He is seven or eight, comely, with black hair and bright blue eyes.Visitors oft thought him Lord Renlys  own son.And Renly favored Robert."
3945,Arya,Catelyn,"Stannis means to parade his  brothers bastard before the realm, so men might see Robert in his face and wonder why there is no such  likeness in Joffrey. Would that mean so much?Those who favor Stannis will call it proof.Those who support Joffrey will say it means nothing."
3946,Harren,Rodrik,"A strong castle, and well garrisoned, but His Grace  shall have it, if I must kill every living soul within to make it so."
3947,Desmond,Rodrik,"A fate he no doubt  earned,Tainted blood is ever treacherous, and Ramsays nature was sly, greedy,  and cruel."
3948,Desmond,Rodrik,The trueborn sons my young wife has promised me would never  have been safe while he lived.
3949,Desmond,Lysa,My lady .
3950,Desmond,Lysa,"across the river.Take a long breath, lad, and tell it slowly."
3951,Desmond,Lysa,"A column of armored men,Across the Red Fork.They are flying  a purple unicorn below the lion of Lannister."
3952,Catelyn,Desmond,"A few outriders, no more,The main  strength of Lord Tywins host is well to the south.We are in no danger here."
3953,Catelyn,Desmond,"No more than fifty, my lady,"
3954,Brienne,Catelyn,"Now,"
3955,Desmond,Edmure,"Would that Lord Hoster could have seen that.It would have made him  dance.My fathers dancing days are past, I fear,"
3956,Desmond,Edmure,"Lord Tywin has twice my brothers numbers.He could have ten times and it would not matter,The west bank of the Red Fork  is higher than the east, my lady, and well wooded."
3957,Catelyn,Edmure,"The river will hold them.I pray that you are right,"
3958,Catelyn,Edmure,"What is it?The ford again, my lady."
3959,Brienne,Catelyn,"That was the brush of Lord Tywins fingertip, my lady,He is  probing, feeling for a weak point, an undefended crossing.if he does not find one, he will curl all his  fingers into a fist and try and make one."
3960,Brienne,Catelyn,Thats what Id do.Were I  him.
3961,Jason,Utherydes,"Have  Ser Cleos Frey brought a flagon of wine.I mean to question him soon, and I want his tongue well  loosened.As you command, my lady."
3962,Edmure,Karyl,"They left a dozen dead in the water, only two reaching the shallows, where we  dealt with them briskly,"
3963,Edmure,Karyl,"Those thrusts too were turned aside, at grievous cost to our foes."
3964,Catelyn,Cleos,"My lady, I knew naught of any escape.  "
3965,Catelyn,Cleos,I know no grandson of Walder Frey would be an oathbreaker.
3966,Catelyn,Cleos,"You brought peace terms, my brother said.I did."
3967,Catelyn,Cleos,"Tell me,"
3968,Catelyn,Edmure,"Lannister will exchange Arya and Sansa for his brother?Yes.He sat on the Iron Throne and swore it.Before witnesses?Before all the court, my lady."
3969,Arya,Robb,"I said as much to Ser Edmure, but he told me it  was not possible, that His Grace Robb would never consent.He told you true."
3970,Catelyn,Cleos,Did you see my girls?Are they treated  well?
3971,Catelyn,Cleos,I .
3972,Catelyn,Cleos,"Ser Cleos,"
3973,Arya,Sansa,I shall ask you once more-did you see my daughters?
3974,Arya,Sansa,"I saw Sansa at the court, the day Tyrion told me his terms."
3975,Arya,Sansa,"Drawn, as it were."
3976,Catelyn,Moon,"His terms,  you said ."
3977,Catelyn,Moon,yet Cersei is Queen Regent.Tyrion spoke for both of them.
3978,Catelyn,Moon,"She was indisposed that day, I was told.Curious."
3979,Cleos,Lysa,"He lied,The Lannisters are liars every one, and the dwarf is  the worst of them.The killer was armed with his own knife."
3980,Brienne,Cleos,"I know nothing of any-You know nothing,"
3981,Desmond,Robb,"And the stars in the night were the eyes of his wolves,  and the wind itself was their song. "
3982,Brienne,Catelyn,"There was always a singer at Evenfall Hall when I was a girl,I learned all the  songs by heart.Sansa did the same, though few singers ever cared to make the long journey north to Winterfell."
3983,Chett,Jacelyn,
3984,Brienne,Catelyn,His hands were almost as big as  mine.
3985,Brienne,Catelyn,Did you sing for your father?
3986,Brienne,Catelyn,For Lord Renly?
3987,Brienne,Catelyn,"Never, I ."
3988,Brienne,Catelyn,.Someday you must sing for me.I .
3989,Brienne,Catelyn,"please, I have no gift."
3990,Brienne,Catelyn,"Forgive me, my lady.Do I have your  leave to go?"
3991,Edmure,Tywin,"Victory, my lady."
3992,Desmond,Tywin,"They shall not cross, Cat,"
3993,Desmond,Tywin,They shall not cross. 
3994,Desmond,Edmure,"Oh, if only I might have been with him,Where is that fool Rymund?"
3995,Catelyn,Edmure,"The mill that ground the Mountain down, I could almost make the words  myself, had I the singers gift.Ill hear no songs until the fightings done,"
3996,Catelyn,Desmond,Riverrun!Tully!
3997,Bran,Jojen,"Summer,Summer."
3998,Hodor,Osha,Hodor!
3999,Bran,Osha,"Hodor, come fast!"
4000,Bran,Osha,"Meera, Joien, anyone!"
4001,Bran,Osha,HOOOOODOOOOOR!
4002,Bran,Theon,What do you want?
4003,Bran,Theon,This is my room.You get out of  here.
4004,Bran,Theon,"Were not here to harm you, Bran.Theon?"
4005,Bran,Theon,Did Robb send you?Is he here too? Robbs far away.He cant help you now.Help me?
4006,Bran,Theon,"Dont scare me, Theon.Im Prince Theon now."
4007,Bran,Theon,"But Ive taken your  castle, my prince.Winterfell?"
4008,Bran,Theon,"No, you couldnt.Leave us, Werlag."
4009,Bran,Theon,"I sent four men  over the walls with grappling claws and ropes, and they opened a postern gate for the rest of us."
4010,Bran,Theon,"I promise you, Winterfell is mine."
4011,Bran,Theon,But youre Fathers ward.And now you and your brother are my wards.
4012,Bran,Theon,"Youll tell them  how youve yielded Winterfell to me, and command them to serve and obey their new lord as they did  the old.I wont,Well fight you and throw you out.I never yielded, you cant make me say I did.This is no game, Bran, so dont play the boy with me, I wont stand for it."
4013,Bran,Theon,"If the prince  would keep them safe, hed best do as hes told."
4014,Bran,Theon,Someone will come  dress you and carry you to the Great Hall.Think carefully on what you want to say.
4015,Hodor,Luwin,"Bran,"
4016,Hodor,Luwin,You have been told?
4017,Hayhead,Luwin,Theon came.He said Winterfell was his now.
4018,Hayhead,Luwin,They swam the moat.
4019,Bran,Hayhead,"Came over wet and dripping, steel in hand."
4020,Bran,Hayhead,"Alebelly was on the gate, they surprised him in the turret and killed him."
4021,Bran,Hayhead,"The bird to White  Harbor got away, but they brought down the other with an arrow."
4022,Bran,Hayhead,"Ser Rodrik took too many of our men, but I am to blame as much as he is."
4023,Bran,Hayhead,.
4024,Bran,Hayhead,"You better help me dress.Yes, thats so."
4025,Bran,Hayhead,"You are the Stark in Winterfell, and Robbs heir.You must look princely."
4026,Bran,Hayhead,"Theon wants me to yield the castle,There is no shame in that."
4027,Bran,Rickon,"Your lord father did what he could to gentle Theon, but I  fear it was too little and too late."
4028,Luwin,Rickon,"I want  Mother,I want her.And Shaggydog too.Your mother is far away, my prince."
4029,Luwin,Rickon,"But Im here, and Bran."
4030,Bran,Walder,"Your brothers lost his kingdom,Youre no  prince now, just a hostage.So are you,and me, and all of us.No one was talking to you, frogeater."
4031,Bran,Rickon,"Theons sitting in Robbs chair,Hush, Rickon."
4032,Beth,Theon,What have we here?
4033,Luwin,Theon,"These are Lady Catelyns wards, both named Walder Frey,And this is  Jojen Reed and his sister Meera, son and daughter to Howland Reed of Greywater Watch, who came to  renew their oaths of fealty to Winterfell.Some might call that ill-timed,though not for me."
4034,Bran,Luwin,"Bring the prince here, Lorren."
4035,Bran,Reek,"We found  this one locked in a tower cell,He says they call him Reek.Cant think why,Do you always smell so bad, or did you just finish fucking a  pig?Havent fucked no one since they took me, mlord."
4036,Bran,Theon,I was in service to the  Bastard o the Dreadfort till the Starks give him an arrow in the back for a wedding gift.
4037,Bran,Theon,"Who did he marry?The widow o Hornwood, mlord. That crone?"
4038,Bran,Theon,"She has teats like empty wineskins, dry and withered.It wasnt her teats he wed her for, mlord."
4039,Mikken,Theon,"You all know me-Aye, we know you for a sack of steaming dung!"
4040,Bran,Robb,"Mikken, you be silent."
4041,Robb,Theon,"Listen to your little lordling, Mikken,He has more sense than you do."
4042,Mikken,Theon,"Ive yielded Winterfell to Theon.Louder, Bran.And call me prince."
4043,Mikken,Theon,I have yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.All of you should do as he commands  you.Damned if I will!
4044,Mikken,Theon,"My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock, and declared  himself King of the Iron Islands."
4045,Mikken,Theon,You are all his  subjects.Bugger that.
4046,Mikken,Theon,"I serve the Starks, not some treasonous squid  of-aah."
4047,Mikken,Theon,"Smiths have strong arms and weak heads,But if  the rest of you serve me as loyally as you served Eddard Stark, youll find me as generous a lord as you  could want."
4048,Bran,Mikken,If you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o-
4049,Bran,Theon,Who else has something to say?
4050,Hodor,Theon,"Hodor hodor hodor hodor, Someone kindly shut that halfwit up."
4051,Hodor,Theon,I will be as good a lord to you as Eddard Stark ever was.
4052,Theon,Torrhen,"Betray me, though, and youll wish you hadnt."
4053,Reek,Theon,"If Robb Stark can stave off the Lannisters,  he may reign as King of the Trident hereafter, but House Greyjoy holds the north now.Starks lords will fight you,That bloated pig at White Harbor for one, and  them Umbers and Karstarks too."
4054,Reek,Theon,Free me and Im yours.
4055,Reek,Theon,"Youre cleverer than you smell, but I could not suffer that stench.Well,I could wash some."
4056,Reek,Theon,Bend the knee.
4057,Mikken,Osha,Mlord Greyjoy!
4058,Mikken,Osha,I was brought here captive too.You were there  the day I was taken.
4059,Bran,Mikken,"I need fighters,not kitchen sluts.It was Robb Stark put me in the kitchens.For the best part of a year, Ive been left to scour kettles,  scrape grease, and warm the straw for this one."
4060,Bran,Mikken,"Ive had a bellyful of it.Put  a spear in my hand again.I got a spear for you right here,"
4061,Mikken,Osha,You keep that soft pink thing.
4062,Osha,Theon,Ill have me the wood and iron.
4063,Hodor,Theon,"Youll do,Keep the spear; Stygg can find another.Now bend  the knee and swear."
4064,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor,"
4065,Arya,Hot,"Theres ghosts, I know there is."
4066,Arya,Pia,Pia  saw something in the buttery last night.
4067,Amory,Hot,Can I  have a tart?
4068,Amory,Hot,You baked a whole tray.I need a whole tray.Ser Amory is partial to them.
4069,Amory,Hot,Lets spit on them.
4070,Arya,Hot,"Hell know.He will not,You cant taste spit.If he does, its me theyll whip."
4071,Arya,Hot,You shouldnt even be here.Its the  black of night.
4072,Amory,Hot,If Pinkeye wakes and finds you gone-Pinkeye never wakes.
4073,Arya,Hot,Not once hes passed out.
4074,Arya,Hot,"I bet we  could escape, and Pinkeye wouldnt even notice I was gone,I dont want to escape."
4075,Arya,Hot,"Here,  sprinkle some flour on the board."
4076,Arya,Hot,Whats that?What?    
4077,Harren,Tywin,Want to go see?
4078,Hot,Tywin,"Im making the morning bread,Anyhow I dont like it when its dark, I told you.Im going."
4079,Hot,Tywin,Can I have a tart?No.
4080,Amory,Vargo,"My lord cathellan,"
4081,Amory,Vargo,"Whats all this, Hoat?"
4082,Amory,Vargo,Captiths.
4083,Amory,Arya,"Thith ith their lord commander, Glover, and the one behind ith  Ther Aenyth Frey."
4084,Arya,Vargo,"Very well,Ser Cadwyn, take these men to the dungeons."
4085,Amory,Vargo,We were promised honorable treatment-Silenth!
4086,Amory,Vargo,"What Hoat promised you is nothing to me.Lord Tywin made me  the castellan of Harrenhal, and I shall do with you as I please."
4087,Amory,Arya,The great cell  under the Widows Tower ought to hold them all.Any who do not care to go are free to die here.
4088,Arya,Gendry,"You should be abed, girl."
4089,Arya,Gendry,What was all that noise?Vargo Floats come back with prisoners.
4090,Arya,Gendry,"The rest too,  mostly."
4091,Arya,Gendry,You have to help me get them  out.
4092,Arya,Gendry,And how do we do that?Ser Amory sent them down to the dungeon.
4093,Arya,Gendry,  
4094,Arya,Gendry,"Wed need to kill the guards.How are we supposed to do that?Maybe there wont be a lot of them.If theres two, thats too many for you and me."
4095,Arya,Gendry,"You  try this and Vargo Hoat will cut off your hands and feet, the way he does."
4096,Amory,Gendry,"Youre afraid.Leave me alone, girl.Gendry, theres a hundred northmen."
4097,Amory,Gendry,"We just have to get them out and we can take  over the castle and escape.Well, you cant get them out, no moren you could save Lommy."
4098,Amory,Gendry,"And if we did escape, where would we go?Winterfell,Id tell Mother how you helped me, and you could stay-Would mlady permit?"
4099,Gendry,Harren,You stop that!Why should I wager my feet for the chance to sweat in Winterfell in place of Harrenhal?
4100,Arya,Tywin,"Ill stay here.The queen will catch you, then.She didnt send gold cloaks after Ben Blackthumb!Likely it wasnt even me they wanted.It was too, you know it.Youre somebody.Im a prentice smith, and one day might be Ill make a master armorer ."
4101,Arya,Tywin,if I dont run off and lose my  feet or get myself killed.
4102,Arya,Tywin,"The next helm you make, put mules ears on it in place of bulls  horns!"
4103,Arya,Jaqen,"You should have saved him,He  prayed to you all the time."
4104,Arya,Jaqen,"I dont think you could even if you wanted  to.Gods are not mocked, girl."
4105,Arya,Jaqen,A man comes to hear a name.
4106,Arya,Jaqen,A man would have done.
4107,Arya,Rorge,How did you know I was here?A man sees.
4108,Arya,Rorge,A man knows.
4109,Biter,Rorge,Howd you make the dog kill Weese?
4110,Biter,Weasel,Is Jaqen Hghar your true name?Some men have many names.
4111,Biter,Weasel,Arya.
4112,Biter,Weasel,"Did Gendry tell?A man knows,My lady of Stark."
4113,Arya,Weasel,I need you to help me get those men out of the  dungeons.
4114,Arya,Jaqen,   he said quietly.
4115,Arya,Jaqen,I want you to save the northmen like I saved you.
4116,Arya,Jaqen,Three lives were snatched from a god.
4117,Arya,Jaqen,The gods are not mocked.
4118,Arya,Jaqen,I never mocked.
4119,Arya,Jaqen,The name .
4120,Arya,Jaqen,And youll kill him?
4121,Arya,Jaqen,A man has said.Anyone?
4122,Arya,Jaqen,"A man, a woman, a little baby, or Lord Tywin, or the High Septon, or your  father?A mans sire is long dead, but did he live, and did you know his name, he would die at your command.Swear it,Swear it by the gods.By all the gods of sea and air, and even him of fire, I swear it."
4123,Arya,Jaqen,"By the seven new gods and the old gods beyond count, I swear it."
4124,Arya,Jaqen,Even if I named the king  
4125,Arya,Jaqen,"A man does not fly like a bird, but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is  there, and a king dies."
4126,Arya,Jaqen,Is it Joffrey?
4127,Arya,Jaqen,Its Jaqen Hghar.
4128,Arya,Jaqen,A girl .
4129,Arya,Jaqen,"she makes a jest.You swore.The gods heard you swear.The gods did hear,"
4130,Arya,Jaqen,A girl will weep.A girl will lose her only friend.Youre not my friend.A friend would help me.
4131,Arya,Jaqen,Id never kill a friend.
4132,Arya,Jaqen,A girl might .
4133,Arya,Jaqen,"name another name then, if a friend did help?A girl might,If a friend did help."
4134,Harren,Jaqen,Come.Now?
4135,Harren,Jaqen,A man hears the whisper of sand in a glass.
4136,Harren,Jaqen,"Now, evil child."
4137,Arya,Jaqen,"The hungry gods will feast on blood tonight, if a man would do this thing,Sweet girl, kind  and gentle.Unsay one name and say another and cast this mad dream aside.I wont.Just so."
4138,Arya,Jaqen,"The thing will be done, but a girl must obey.A man has no time for  talk.A girl will obey,What should I do?A hundred men are hungry, they must be fed, the lord commands hot broth.A girl must run to the  kitchens and tell her pie boy.Broth  Where will you be?A girl will help make broth, and wait in the kitchens until a man comes for her."
4139,Arya,Hot,Run.
4140,Hot,Vargo,"What do you want, Weasel?"
4141,Hot,Vargo,"Broth,My lord wants broth."
4142,Hot,Pia,What do you think that is?
4143,Arya,Pia,Cant even let a man have a nights sleep.
4144,Arya,Pia,"Well, never you mind, run back and tell him a kettle cant be hurried,Im to wait here until its done.Then stay out of the way."
4145,Arya,Pia,"Wake up Pia and tell her shed best be nimble for once, if she wants to keep  both of her feet."
4146,Arya,Pia,"Here, help me with these,I cant.But you better hurry or Vargo Hoat will chop off your foot."
4147,Arya,Rorge,"Cook,Well take your bloody broth."
4148,Biter,Jaqen,"The bloody broth isnt bloody ready yet,It needs to simmer.  I said broth and I  said now."
4149,Biter,Jaqen,"Take your bloody broth, then, but if the goat asks why it tastes so thin, you tell  him."
4150,Arya,Jaqen,A weasel will help.
4151,Jaqen,Rorge,Whats this?
4152,Jaqen,Rorge,"A pot of boiling piss, want some?"
4153,Arya,Jaqen,"A prisoner must eat too.No one said nothing about-Its for them, not you."
4154,Arya,Rorge,"Bring it down, then."
4155,Arya,Jaqen,"A girl will stay out of the way,"
4156,Arya,Rorge,"Theres the ugliest serving wench I ever  saw,Whats in the kettle?Your cock and balls.You want to eat or not?"
4157,Jaqen,Rorge,"About bloody time they fed us.That onions I smell?So wheres the bread?Fuck, we need bowls, cups, spoons-No you dont."
4158,Arya,Rorge,A girl should be bloody too.This is her work.
4159,Jaqen,Rorge,"Well done,I am  Robett Glover.My lord."
4160,Harren,Rorge,"This of the soup, that was clever,I did not expect  that.Was it Lord Hoats idea?"
4161,Biter,Rorge,Who are you men?
4162,Biter,Rorge,You were not with Hoat  when he came to Lord Boltons encampment.Are you of the Brave Companions?
4163,Biter,Rorge,"We are now.This man has the honor to be Jaqen Hghar, once of the Free City of Lorath."
4164,Biter,Rorge,A lord will know which is Biter.
4165,Arya,Biter,"And here-Im Weasel,"
4166,Biter,Rorge,"Very well,Lets make an end to this bloody business."
4167,Arya,Jaqen,"A girl does not understand?Yes I do,"
4168,Arya,Jaqen,A goat has no loyalty.
4169,Arya,Jaqen,But first a man would hear a certain name unsaid.I take back the name.
4170,Arya,Jaqen,Do I still have a third death?A girl is greedy.
4171,Arya,Jaqen,"Here is  three and there is four and eight more lie dead below.The debt is paid.The debt is paid,"
4172,Arya,Jaqen,A god has his due.And now a man must die.
4173,Arya,Jaqen,Die?
4174,Arya,Jaqen,But I unsaid the name.You dont need to die now.I do.My time is done.
4175,Arya,Jaqen,Who are you?
4176,Arya,Jaqen,How did you do  that?Was it hard?
4177,Arya,Jaqen,"No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.Show me,I want to do it too.If you would learn, you must come with me."
4178,Arya,Jaqen,"Where?Far and away, across the narrow sea.I cant."
4179,Arya,Jaqen,"To Winterfell.Then we must part,for I have duties too."
4180,Arya,Jaqen,Here.What is it?A coin of great value.
4181,Arya,Jaqen,"Is it worth enough to buy a horse?It is not meant for the buying of horses.Then what good is it?As well ask what good is life, what good is death?if the day comes  when you would find me again, give that coin to any man from Braavos, and say these words to  him-valar morghulis.Valar morghulis,"
4182,Arya,Jaqen,"Please dont go, Jaqen.Jaqen is as dead as Arry,"
4183,Arya,Jaqen,"Say it again.Valar morghulis, "
4184,Amory,Arya,"Valar morghulis, "
4185,Arya,Harren,"Them Bloody Mummers killed some of Ser Amorys lot in their beds, and the  rest at table after they were good and drunk."
4186,Arya,Harren,Any foolery and Ill whip the skin off your back.
4187,Arya,Shagwell,What  did you die of?
4188,Arya,Shagwell,"Hot weasel soup,"
4189,Arya,Harren,On your knees for  the Lord of the Dreadfort!
4190,Harren,Vargo,"My lord, Harrenhal ith yourth."
4191,Arya,Shagwell,"My lord, my  lord,heres the weasel who made the soup!Let go,"
4192,Arya,Shagwell,"How old are you,  child?"
4193,Arya,Lommy,"Ten.Ten, my lord,Are you fond of animals?Some kinds.My lord."
4194,Lommy,Sansa,"But not lions, it would seem.Nor manticores."
4195,Lommy,Sansa,They tell me you are called Weasel.
4196,Lommy,Sansa,What name did your mother give you?
4197,Arya,Sansa,"Nymeria,Only she called me Nan for short.You will call me my lord when you speak to me, Nan,You are too young to be a  Brave Companion, I think, and of the wrong sex.Are you afraid of leeches, child?Theyre only leeches.My lord.My squire could take a lesson from you, it would seem."
4198,Amory,Arya,"For so long as I remain at Harrenhal, Nan,  you shall be my cupbearer, and serve me at table and in chambers."
4199,Amory,Nan,"Yes, your lord.I mean, my  lord."
4200,Amory,Nan,"Make her presentable,and make certain she knows how to pour wine without spilling it.Lord Hoat, see to those banners above the gatehouse."
4201,Drogo,Jorah,"Blood of my blood,"
4202,Jorah,Xaro,Let us go before it drinks us as well.
4203,Jorah,Xaro,"What power can they have if they live in that?Heed the wisdom of those who love you best,Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows."
4204,Aggo,Jhogo,They have  naught to give.
4205,Aggo,Jhogo,"Khaleesi, it is said that many go into the Palace of Dust, but few come  out.It is said,We are blood of your blood,sworn to live and die as you do. Daenerys said. Ser Jorah urged.  "
4206,Daenerys,Xaro,"Should she turn away now, the doors of wisdom  shall be closed to her forevermore.My pleasure barge awaits, even now,Turn away from this folly, most  stubborn of queens.I have flutists who will soothe your troubled soul with sweet music, and a small girl  whose tongue will make you sigh and melt."
4207,Daenerys,Jorah,"Your Grace, remember Mirri Maz Duur.I do,I remember that she had knowledge.And she was only a maegi."
4208,Daenerys,Jorah,"The child speaks as sagely as a crone.Take my arm, and let me lead you.I am no child."
4209,Chett,Jacelyn,
4210,Chett,Daenerys,"If you value your soul, take  care and do just as I tell you.I will do as you say,When you enter, you will find yourself in a room with four doors: the one you have come through and  three others."
4211,Chett,Daenerys,"Never go down, and never take any door but the first door to your right.The door to my right,I understand.And when I leave, the opposite?By no means,Leaving and coming, it is the same."
4212,Chett,Daenerys,"Answer or ignore  them as you choose, but enter no room until you reach the audience chamber.I understand.When you come to the chamber of the Undying, be patient."
4213,Chett,Daenerys,"Listen well, and write each word upon your  heart."
4214,Daenerys,Drogo,"Take and drink,Will it turn my lips blue?One flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes, so that you may  hear and see the truths that will be laid before you."
4215,Daenerys,Drogo,"Now you may enter,"
4216,Daenerys,Willem,"Little princess, there you are,Come,come to me, my lady, youre home now, youre safe now."
4217,Daenerys,Drogo,"Let him be king over charred  bones and cooked meat,Let him be the king of  ashes."
4218,Daenerys,Viserys,"Aegon,What better name for a king?Will you make a song for him?"
4219,Daenerys,Viserys,"He has a song,He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and  fire."
4220,Daenerys,Viserys,"There must be one more,The dragon has three heads."
4221,Chett,Daenerys,Can  it be that the Undying are done with you so soon?
4222,Chett,Daenerys,So soon?
4223,Chett,Daenerys,"Ive walked for hours, and still not found them.You have taken a wrong turning.Come, I will lead you."
4224,Chett,Daenerys,"Thats not the way,The Undying Ones will  not wait forever.Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moths wing to them,Stubborn child.You will be lost, and never found."
4225,Chett,Daenerys,"No,No, to me, come to me, to meeeeeee."
4226,Chett,Drogo,"Daenerys of House Targaryen, be  welcome."
4227,Chett,Drogo,"We are the Undying of Qarth.Long have we awaited you,"
4228,Daenerys,Drogo,"We knew you were to come to us,A thousand years ago we knew, and have  been waiting all this time.We sent the comet to show you the way.We have knowledge to share with you,"
4229,Daenerys,Drogo,"Now come and sit with us, and all your questions shall be answered."
4230,Daenerys,Drogo,"A willful beast,Shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind?Come, come."
4231,Chett,Jacelyn,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of House  Targaryen, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros."
4232,Chett,Jacelyn,"Grant me your counsel, and speak to me with the wisdom of those who  have conquered death."
4233,Chett,Daenerys,"I have come for the gift of truth,In the long hall, the things I saw ."
4234,Chett,Daenerys,What did they mean?
4235,Chett,Daenerys,Three?
4236,Chett,Viserys,I dont .
4237,Chett,Viserys,.
4238,Chett,Viserys,"I dont understand,"
4239,Chett,Viserys,Help me.Show me.
4240,Daenerys,Mirri,Mother!
4241,Daenerys,Mirri,"Mother, mother!"
4242,Chett,Daenerys,"Drogon, "
4243,Chett,Jacelyn,
4244,Shagga,Tyrion,The Halfman has no goats.Ill get some just for YOU.
4245,Moon,Tyrion,"Whatever you do, dont try and fight a battle,Strike at their camps and baggage train."
4246,Chett,Jacelyn,  Shagga laid a hand atop Tyrions head.
4247,Shagga,Tyrion,"Heed their counsel and theyll serve you well.Shagga will listen to the Halfmans pets,"
4248,Bronn,Tyrion,"Theyll kill for that knighthood, but dont ever think theyll  die for it."
4249,Cersei,Tyrion,"Theres few out-and-out traitors, though theres  some, even your spider hasnt found them all,But theres hundreds greener  than spring grass, men who joined for bread and ale and safety."
4250,Cersei,Robert,The first man to throw down his  spear and run will have a thousand more trodding on his heels.
4251,Bronn,Stannis,Assemble a hundred men and burn everything you see here between the  waters edge and the city walls.
4252,Bronn,Stannis,"I want  nothing left standing, do you understand?"
4253,Bronn,Tyrion,"Them as own all this wont like that  much.I never imagined they would.So be it; theyll have something else to curse the evil monkey demon for.Some may fight.See that they lose.What do we do with those that live here?Let them have a reasonable time to remove their property, and then move them out."
4254,Bronn,Tyrion,"Keep your men in line, damn it.Theyre sellswords, not septons,Next youll be telling me you want them sober.It couldnt hurt."
4255,Harren,Varys,"The gods give with one hand and take with the other,"
4256,Joffrey,Tyrion,"What if you should lose, my lord?"
4257,Joffrey,Tyrion,Then apply to King Stannis for your compensation.
4258,Cersei,Joffrey,"Ser Osmund is as loyal as he is brave,"
4259,Shae,Tyrion,"Better a ladys maid than a pot girl,Can I  take my belt of silver flowers and my gold collar with the black diamonds you said looked like my eyes?I wont wear them if you say I shouldnt."
4260,Shae,Tanda,"Choose two or three dresses, no more,Good wool, no silk, no samite,  and no fur.The rest Ill keep in my own chambers for when you visit me."
4261,Stannis,Tyrion,"I want the gods on our side,Tell them that Stannis has vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor.Is it true, my lord?"
4262,Stannis,Tyrion,It may be.
4263,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Tell them that any man  who thinks to give aid to the usurper betrays the gods as well as his rightful king.I shall, my lord.And I shall command them to pray for the health of the king and his Hand as well."
4264,Hallyne,Tyrion,"This cannot be true,Almost thirteen thousand jars?"
4265,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Im not  about to pay the kings gold for empty jars and pots of sewage sealed with wax, I warn you.No, no,"
4266,Hallyne,Tyrion,"He was so drunk he broke the seal and drank some.There was a prince who tried that once,I havent seen any dragons rising over the  city, so it would seem it didnt work this time either."
4267,Hallyne,Tyrion,"Three hundred  jars, you say?"
4268,Hallyne,Tyrion,"You are several thousand jars ahead of the best  estimate you gave me when last we met.Yes, yes, thats so."
4269,Hallyne,Tyrion,"We have been working very hard, my lord Hand, hmmm.That would doubtless explain why you are making so much more of the substance than before."
4270,Hallyne,Tyrion,Though it does raise the question of why you did  not begin working hard until now.
4271,Hallyne,Tyrion,"We were, my lord Hand, my brothers and I have been laboring day and night  from the first, I assure you.-the alchemist shifted uncomfortably-"
4272,Jacelyn,Tyrion,.
4273,Hallyne,Jacelyn,"Yes, you have secret spells; how splendid.What of them?They, hmmm, seem to be working better than they were."
4274,Hallyne,Jacelyn,"You dont suppose  there are any dragons about, do you? Not unless you found one under the Dragonpit.Why?Oh, pardon, I was just remembering something old Wisdom Pollitor told me once, when I was an  acolyte.Id asked him why so many of our spells seemed, well, not as effectual as the scrolls would have  us believe, and he said it was because magic had begun to go out of the world the day the last dragon  died.Sorry to disappoint you, but Ive seen no dragons."
4275,Hallyne,Jacelyn,"Should any of these fruits youre selling me turn out to be filled  with anything but wildfire, youll be seeing him as well."
4276,Gyles,Tyrion,How does  my nephew fare?
4277,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Prince Tornmen is hale and happy, my lord."
4278,Joffrey,Myrcella,"His brother, however, he does not seem to miss at all.You have made suitable arrangements for him, should the battle be lost?My men have their instructions.Which are?You commanded me to tell no one, my lord."
4279,Joffrey,Myrcella,Im pleased you remember.
4280,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Men are such faithless creatures,"
4281,Jacelyn,Tyrion,Whos the traitor today?
4282,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"So much villainy, it sings a sad song for our age.Did honor die with  our fathers?My father is not dead yet."
4283,Jacelyn,Tyrion,I know some of these names.
4284,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"Why should they conspire against us?It seems they believe that Lord Stannis must win, and wish to share his victory.They call themselves the  Antler Men, after the crowned stag.Someone should tell them that Stannis changed his sigil.Then they can be the Hot Hearts."
4285,Jacelyn,Tyrion,"I suppose this means I wont be getting that terrifying helm with the demon  horns,"
4286,Theon,Urzen,"The wolves are  quiet,Go see what theyre doing, and come straight back."
4287,Theon,Wex,"Make certain  Bran Stark and his little brother are in their beds, and be quick about it.Mlord?"
4288,Theon,Wex,"Go back to sleep, this does not concern you."
4289,Theon,Urzen,The wolves be gone.
4290,Eddard,Lorren,"Rouse the castle,Herd  them out into the yard, everyone, well see whos missing."
4291,Lorren,Stygg,"Wex, with me."
4292,Benfred,Mikken,"I bear  you no ill will,but you and your gods have no  place here now."
4293,Lorren,Urzen,"The Hunters Gate,Best come see."
4294,Drennan,Theon,Who had the guard here?
4295,Drennan,Theon,Drennan and Squint.
4296,Lorren,Palla,"If theyve let the boys escape, Ill have more than a  little skin off their back this time, I swear it.No need for that,"
4297,Lorren,Theon,"Squint was up on the wallwalk,  no?Aye,"
4298,Lorren,Theon,Id say Drennan was pulling down his breeches to stick it in the  woman when she stuck it in him.
4299,Drennan,Lorren,Someone find a pike and fish    the other fool out of the moat.
4300,Lorren,Theon,"The direwolves,Both of them, at a guess."
4301,Drennan,Squint,"Blood,"
4302,Squint,Urzen,They pushed the  corpse through the crenel into the moat so he wouldnt be found by another sentry.
4303,Theon,Urzen,"The other watch turrets are not far.   Theon said testily. said Black Lorren, Urzen said,   I am served by fools."
4304,Theon,Urzen,"You catch a glimpse of  teeth, start to level your spear, and they slam into you and open your belly, tearing through leather as if it  were cheesecloth."
4305,Theon,Urzen,"And now youre down on your back, your guts are  spilling out, and one of them has his teeth around your neck."
4306,Theon,Urzen,"Tell me, at what moment during all of this do you stop to blow your  fucking horn?"
4307,Lorren,Theon,"We must go after them,Not in the dark."
4308,Lorren,Theon,"Well wait for daylight.Until then, I had best go speak with my  loyal subjects."
4309,Reek,Theon,How  many are missing?Six.
4310,Osha,Reek,"Both Starks, that  bog boy and his sister, the halfwit from the stables, and your wildling woman."
4311,Asha,Reek,Has anyone had a look at the stables?Aggar says no horses are missing.Dancer is still in his stall?Dancer?
4312,Asha,Reek,Aggar says the horses are all there.Only the halfwit is missing.
4313,Rickon,Theon,"Bran and Rickon have  fled,Who knows where theyve gone?"
4314,Rickon,Theon,"They could not have escaped without help,Without food, clothing, weapons."
4315,Rickon,Theon,Ill have  the names of all those who aided them.All those who turned a blind eye.
4316,Rickon,Theon,"Come first light, I mean to bring them back."
4317,Rickon,Theon,I need  huntsmen.
4318,Rickon,Theon,Gage?
4319,Rickon,Theon,The wild is no place for a cripple.
4320,Rickon,Theon,"Nan, think how frightened he must be."
4321,Reek,Rickon,"I  might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure, but instead I  protected you.Is this the thanks you offer?"
4322,Reek,Theon,"Strip off their skins,Lord Bolton, he used to  say a naked man has few secrets, but a flayed mans got none."
4323,Reek,Theon,"There will be no flaying in the north so long as I rule in Winterfell,"
4324,Bran,Theon,"Joseth, saddle Smiler and a horse  for yourself.Murch, Gariss, Poxy Tym, youll come as well."
4325,Bran,Theon,"Aggar, Rednose, Gelmarr, Reek, Wex."
4326,Bran,Theon,"Farlen, Ill want hounds, and you to handle them."
4327,Bran,Theon,"And why would I care to hunt down my own trueborn  lords, and babes at that?"
4328,Bran,Theon,"I am your trueborn lord now, and the man who keeps Palla safe."
4329,Bran,Theon,"Aye, mlord."
4330,Bran,Theon,"Maester Luwin,I know nothing of hunting."
4331,Bran,Theon,Then its past time you learned.Let me come too.I want that wolfskin cloak.
4332,Theon,Walder,"Ive hunted lots of times before,Red deer and  elk, and even boar."
4333,Theon,Walder,"He rode on a boar hunt with his father, but they never let him near the boar."
4334,Lorren,Theon,"Come if you like, but if you cant keep up, dont think that Ill nurse  you along."
4335,Lorren,Theon,"Winterfell is yours in my absence.If we do not return, do with it as you will."
4336,Luwin,Theon,"Thus far  hunting seems indistinguishable from riding through the woods, my lord."
4337,Luwin,Theon,"There are similarities.But with hunting, theres blood at the end.Must it be so?"
4338,Meera,Theon,"These are your foster brothers  we seek.No Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me, but Bran and Rickon have more value to me living  than dead.The same is true of the Reeds."
4339,Meera,Theon,"Lord Howland can make your uncles occupation a visit to hell if he chooses, but so long as you  hold his heirs he must stay his hand."
4340,Hodor,Meera,"You may be right.We will spare them if  we can.And Hodor too, I hope."
4341,Hodor,Theon,"How many times has  he groomed your horse, soaped your saddle, scoured your mail?"
4342,Hodor,Theon,"if he does not fight us, we will let him live."
4343,Hodor,Theon,"But say  one word about sparing the wildling, and you can die with her.She swore me an oath, and pissed on it."
4344,Luwin,Theon,I make no apologies for oathbreakers.
4345,Luwin,Theon,I thank you  for your mercy.
4346,Osha,Theon,"Farlen, are you certain were on the right trail?"
4347,Osha,Wex,Could your dogs  be chasing the wrong wolves?My bitch knows the smell of Summer and Shaggy well enough.I hope so.For your sake.
4348,Theon,Wex,"They went in here, mlord, but I  cant see where they come out,"
4349,Theon,Wex,"They wont  have stayed long in this,Take half the dogs downstream, Ill go up-What is it?"
4350,Theon,Wex,"Pawprints, yes.So?"
4351,Theon,Wex,"A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud,More  so with the weight of a boy on his back."
4352,Theon,Wex,See for yourself.
4353,Bran,Theon,Osha must  have turned aside back of us.
4354,Bran,Theon,"She sent the wolves on by themselves, hoping  wed chase after them."
4355,Bran,Theon,"If you two have played me false-Theres been only the one trail, my lord, I swear it,And the direwolves would  never have parted from them boys.Not for long."
4356,Aggar,Rickon,"Gariss, Murch, take four dogs and double back, find where we lost  them."
4357,Walder,Wex,"Once we  find where they went, theyll lead us back to their masters."
4358,Reek,Theon,"The only thing those dogs are flt for is a bear baiting,Would that I had  a bear.The dogs are not at fault."
4359,Reek,Theon,"Running water dont hold no scents, mlord.The wolves had to come out of the stream somewhere.No doubt they did."
4360,Reek,Theon,"We keep on, well find the place, but which way?I never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles,A man might."
4361,Reek,Theon,But a wolf?
4362,Aggar,Theon,Well return to the brook.
4363,Aggar,Theon,"This time well go as far as we  must.We wont find them,Not so long as the frogeaters are with them."
4364,Luwin,Theon,"Their houses  move, even the castles like Greywater Watch."
4365,Luwin,Theon,"They might be out there right now, listening to everything we say."
4366,Luwin,Theon,"My dogs    would smell anything in them bushes.Be all over them before you could break wind, boy.Frogeaters dont smell like men,They have a boggy stink, like frogs and trees and  scummy water.Moss grows under their arms in place of hair, and they can live with nothing to eat but  mud and breathe swamp water."
4367,Luwin,Theon,The histories say the crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest in the days when the  greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck.It may be that they have secret  knowledge.
4368,Luwin,Theon,"The only children that concern me are Bran and Rickon,Back to the stream.Now."
4369,Chett,Jacelyn,"This is fruitless, my lord. said Maester Luwin."
4370,Asha,Reek,Mlord prince.
4371,Asha,Reek,Might be them Starks never came this way.
4372,Reek,Theon,Might be I know where.
4373,Reek,Theon,"Tell me.You know that old mill, sitting lonely on the Acorn Water?"
4374,Reek,Theon,Might be the Starks are hiding there.
4375,Reek,Theon,Why there?There are a dozen villages and holdfasts just as close.
4376,Reek,Theon,Why?
4377,Reek,Theon,"But theyre there, I have a  feeling."
4378,Reek,Theon,What are you  saying?  
4379,Reek,Theon,Have a look here.
4380,Reek,Theon,"Gelmarr,"
4381,Chett,Theon,Aggar.
4382,Chett,Theon,"I know where  Bran and Rickon are hiding now.Prince Theon,you will remember your promise?"
4383,Chett,Theon,Before they made  me angry.
4384,Dalbridge,Jon,"Watchers in the Skirling Pass,"
4385,Dalbridge,Ebben,"What is it Mance Rayder  fears, I wonder? If he knew theyd lit a fire, hed flay the poor bastards,Fire is life up here,but it can be death as well."
4386,Ebben,Stonesnake,"Theyll have a horn,A horn they must not blow.Thats a long cruel climb by night,"
4387,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"And a longer fall,Two men, I think.There are like to be two up there, sharing  the watch.Me."
4388,Jon,Qhorin,"And me,"
4389,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"The wolf will remain with us,White fur is seen too easily by moonlight."
4390,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"When its done, throw down a burning brand.Well come when we see it fall.No better time to start than now,"
4391,Jon,Stonesnake,"Stay,Ill be back for  you."
4392,Jon,Stonesnake,"The mountain is your mother,Cling to her, press your face up against her teats,  and she wont drop you."
4393,Jon,Stonesnake,"Straight up here,We want to get above them."
4394,Jon,Stonesnake,Follow me when the rope grows taut.
4395,Jon,Stonesnake,"A girl.A watcher,A wildling.Finish her."
4396,Arya,Stonesnake,Will you yield?
4397,Arya,Stonesnake,I yield.
4398,Jon,Stonesnake,"Youre our captive, then."
4399,Jon,Stonesnake,"Qhorin said nothing of taking captives,He never said not to."
4400,Jon,Stonesnake,Shes a spearwife.
4401,Jon,Stonesnake,She  was reaching for that when you grabbed her.Give her half a chance and shell bury it between your  eyes.I wont give her half a chance.
4402,Jon,Stonesnake,Do you have a name?Ygritte.
4403,Jon,Stonesnake,"You are my  captive, Ygritte.I gave you my name.Im Jon Snow."
4404,Jon,Stonesnake,"An evil name.A bastard name,My father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell."
4405,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"Its the captive supposed to tell  things, remember?"
4406,Stonesnake,Ygritte,Not that she will.Ive known wildlings  to bite off their own tongues before theyd answer a question.
4407,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"You ought to burn them you killed,Need a bigger fire for that, and big fires burn bright."
4408,Jon,Stonesnake,"Are there more wildlings close by, is that it?Burn them,or it might be youll need them swords again."
4409,Jon,Stonesnake,Maybe we should do as she says.There are other ways.
4410,Arya,Jon,Were you sent to watch for us?
4411,Jon,Stonesnake,"You, and others."
4412,Jon,Stonesnake,"What waits beyond the pass?The free folk.How many?Hundreds and thousands.More than you ever saw, crow."
4413,Stonesnake,Ygritte,Why come here?
4414,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"Whats in the Frostfangs that your king could want?You cant stay here, theres no food."
4415,Stonesnake,Ygritte,Do you mean to march on the Wall?When?
4416,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"Do you know anything of my uncle, Benjen Stark?"
4417,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"if she spits out her tongue, dont say I didnt warn you."
4418,Jon,Ygritte,"They wont trouble us,Its the dead theyve come for."
4419,Jon,Ygritte,"Theyll stay near the bodies till theyve eaten every last stringy shred o meat, and cracked the bones for  the marrow."
4420,Jon,Ygritte,Were they your kin?
4421,Jon,Ygritte,The two we killed?No more than you are.Me?
4422,Jon,Ygritte,What do you mean?You said you were the Bastard o Winterfell.I am.Who was your mother?Some woman.Most of them are.
4423,Jon,Ygritte,"And she never sung you the song o the winter rose?I never knew my mother.Or any such song.Bael the Bard made it,He was King-beyond-the--Wall a long time back.All the free  folk know his songs, but might be you dont sing them in the south.Winterfells not in the south,Yes it is.Everything below the Walls south to us."
4424,Jon,Ygritte,"I suppose its all in where youre standing.Aye,It always is.Tell me,"
4425,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"I want to hear this tale of yours.Might be you wont like it much.Ill hear it all the same.Brave black crow,Well, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael was a great  raider."
4426,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"A murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.Thats all in where youre standing too,The Stark in Winterfell wanted Baels head, but  never could take him, and the taste o failure galled him."
4427,Stonesnake,Ygritte,"North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Starks own table, and  played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone."
4428,Bran,Brandon,"Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor  precious."
4429,Brandon,Jon,"Her bed they found empty, but for the pale  blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain."
4430,Bran,Brandon,Which Brandon was this supposed to be?
4431,Brandon,Ygritte,   Ygritte said sharply.
4432,Brandon,Ygritte,Go on.Lord Brandon had no other children.
4433,Bran,Brandon,"He followed the sound and found his  daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a babe at her breast.Bael had brought her back?No."
4434,Brandon,Jon,"So there it is-you have Baels  blood in you, same as me.It never happened,"
4435,Brandon,Jon,"Might be it did, might be it didnt."
4436,Chett,Jon,Like yours.
4437,Chett,Jon,"The song ends when they find the babe, but there is a darker end to the story."
4438,Jon,Qhorin,"and killed him, for Bael would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword.So the son slew the father instead,Aye,"
4439,Jon,Qhorin,"One o his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak.Your Bael was a liar,No,but a bards truth is different than yours or mine."
4440,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"There were three,"
4441,Jon,Stonesnake,"We passed two,or what the cats had left of them."
4442,Jon,Qhorin,"She yielded,"
4443,Jon,Qhorin,Do you know who I am?Qhorin Halfhand.
4444,Dalbridge,Jon,"Tell me true.If I fell into the hands of your people and yielded myself, what would it win me?A slower death than elsewise."
4445,Dalbridge,Jon,"We have no food to feed her, nor can we spare a man to watch her.The way before us is perilous enough, lad,One shout when we need silence,  and every man of us is doomed."
4446,Ebben,Jon,A steel kiss will keep her quiet.
4447,Jon,Qhorin,"She yielded herself to me.Then you must do what needs be done,You are the blood of Winterfell and a  man of the Nights Watch."
4448,Jon,Qhorin,"Come, brothers."
4449,Jon,Qhorin,It will go easier  for him if we do not watch.
4450,Mance,Ygritte,"You never killed a woman before, did you?"
4451,Jon,Mance,"Them crows would never catch us.Im as much a crow as they are,"
4452,Jon,Mance,"Will you burn me, after?I cant.The smoke might be seen.Thats so."
4453,Jon,Mance,"Well, theres worse places to end up than the belly of a shadowcat."
4454,Jon,Mance,"Arent you afraid?Last night I was,But now the suns up."
4455,Jon,Ygritte,"Strike hard and true, crow, or Ill come back and haunt you."
4456,Jon,Ygritte,"Thats cold,Go on, be quick about it."
4457,Jon,Ygritte,"Do it,Bastard."
4458,Jon,Ygritte,I cant stay brave forever.
4459,Jon,Ygritte,"Go,"
4460,Jon,Ygritte,"Now,before my wits return."
4461,Dontos,Sansa,"Its only from the smoke,It looks as though half the  kingswood is burning.Lord Stannis wants to smoke out the Imps savages."
4462,Dontos,Stannis,They kill his  scouts and raid his baggage train.
4463,Chett,Jacelyn,the Spider pays in gold for any  little trifle.
4464,Dontos,Florian,Is it true Lord  Stannis burned the godswood at Storms End?
4465,Dontos,Florian,He made a great pyre of the trees as an offering to his new god.
4466,Dontos,Sansa,"Hes vowed to burn the Great Sept of  Baelor too, if he takes the city.Let him."
4467,Joffrey,Sansa,"I want it burned.Hush, child, the gods will hear you.Why should they?They never hear my prayers.Yes they do.They sent me to you, didnt they?"
4468,Dontos,Sansa,"They sent you, but what good  have you done?You promised you would take me home, but Im still here."
4469,Dontos,Sansa,"Ive spoken to a certain man I know, a good friend to me ."
4470,Dontos,Sansa,"He will hire a swift ship to take us to safety, when the time is right.The time is right now,"
4471,Dontos,Sansa,"I know  we could slip away if we tried.Child, child."
4472,Dontos,Sansa,"Out of the castle, yes, we could do that, but the city gates are  more heavily guarded than ever, and the Imp has even closed off the river."
4473,Dontos,Sansa,"When Stannis comes, hell have ten times as many men as Joffrey does, everyone says so."
4474,Dontos,Sansa,"The size of his host does not matter,  sweetling, so long as they are on the wrong side of the river.Stannis cannot cross without ships.He has ships.More than Joffrey.Its a long sail from Storms End, the fleet will need to come up Masseys Hook and through the Gullet  and across Blackwater Bay.Perhaps the good gods will send a storm to sweep them from the seas."
4475,Dontos,Sansa,"It is not easy for you, I know."
4476,Dontos,Sansa,"Have faith in your Florian, and try not to be afraid."
4477,Dontos,Sansa,"If I were still a knight, I should have to put on armor and man the walls with  the rest.I ought to kiss King Joffreys feet and thank him sweetly.If you thanked him for making you a fool, hed make you a knight again,"
4478,Dontos,Sansa,"My Jonquils a clever girl, isnt she?Joffrey and his mother say Im stupid.Let them."
4479,Dontos,Sansa,"Queen Cersei and the Imp and Lord Varys and their like,  they all watch each other keen as hawks, and pay this one and that one to spy out what the others are  doing, but no one ever troubles themselves about Lady Tandas daughter, do they?"
4480,Dontos,Sansa,"Gods preserve you, my little Jonquil."
4481,Dontos,Sansa,Give your Florian a little kiss now.A kiss for luck.
4482,Sandor,Sansa,"Let go of me,Let go.The little bird thinks she has wings, does she?Or do you mean to end up crippled like that brother of  yours?"
4483,Sandor,Sansa,I wasnt going to fall.
4484,Sandor,Sansa,"you startled me, thats all.You mean I scared you.And still do."
4485,Sandor,Sansa,"I thought I was alone, I She glanced away.The little bird still cant bear to look at me, can she?"
4486,Sandor,Sansa,"You were glad enough  to see my face when the mob had you, though.Remember?"
4487,Baelor,Sandor,I .
4488,Chett,Jacelyn, she said haltingly.
4489,Baelor,Eddard,you were so brave.Brave?
4490,Baelor,Eddard,"A dog doesnt need courage to chase off rats.They had me thirty to  one, and not a man of them dared face me."
4491,Baelor,Eddard,"Does it give you joy to scare people?No, it gives me joy to kill people."
4492,Baelor,Eddard,"Wrinkle up your face all you like, but spare me  this false piety."
4493,Baelor,Eddard,Dont tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a  man.That was his duty.He never liked it.Is that what he told you?
4494,Baelor,Eddard,Your father lied.Killing is the sweetest thing there  is.
4495,Baelor,Eddard,Heres your truth.
4496,Ilyn,Sansa,Do you  remember the dance he did when his head came off his shoulders?
4497,Ilyn,Sansa,Why are you always so hateful?
4498,Ilyn,Sansa,".Just as if I was one of those true knights you love so well, yes."
4499,Ilyn,Sansa,Knights are for killing.
4500,Sandor,Sansa,I killed my first man at twelve.
4501,Sandor,Sansa,Let them have their sers.
4502,Sandor,Sansa,"So long as I have this,theres no man on  earth I need fear."
4503,Sandor,Sansa,Not even the men across the river?
4504,Sandor,Sansa,All this burning.
4505,Sandor,Sansa,Only cowards  fight with fire.Lord Stannis is no coward.-  Robert never let a little thing like a river stop him.What will you do when he crosses?Fight.
4506,Sandor,Sansa,"Die, maybe.Arent you afraid?The gods might send you down to some terrible hell for all the evil youve done.What evil?"
4507,Sandor,Sansa,What gods?The gods who made us all.All?
4508,Sandor,Sansa,"Tell me, little bird, what kind of god makes a monster like the Imp, or a halfwit like  Lady Tandas daughter?If there are gods, they made sheep so wolves could eat mutton, and they made  the weak for the strong to play with.True knights protect the weak."
4509,Sandor,Sansa,"There are no true knights, no more than there are gods."
4510,Sandor,Sansa,"Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, dont ever believe  any different."
4511,Sandor,Sansa,Youre awful.Im honest.
4512,Sandor,Sansa,"Now fly away, little bird, Im sick of you peeping at me."
4513,Dontos,Loras,"No,no, please, dont, dont,"
4514,Chett,Jacelyn,"No, please,please, no."
4515,Cersei,Sansa,"Its not as pretty as your own things, but it will serve,Your shoes werent burned, so at least you wont need to go barefoot  to the queen."
4516,Cersei,Sansa,"You may sit,Are you hungry?"
4517,Stannis,Tyrion,"No, thank you, Your Grace.I dont blame you."
4518,Catelyn,Sansa,What did you hope to accomplish? 
4519,Catelyn,Sansa,The blood frightened me.The blood is the seal of your womanhood.
4520,Catelyn,Sansa,"Youve had your  first flowering, no more."
4521,Cersei,Sansa,"My lady mother told me, but I ."
4522,Cersei,Sansa,I thought it would be different.Different how?I dont know.
4523,Cersei,Sansa,"less messy, and more magical."
4524,Cersei,Sansa,"Wait until you birth a child, Sansa."
4525,Cersei,Joffrey,and the parts that look like magic often turn out to be messiest of  all.
4526,Cersei,Joffrey,"So now you are a woman.Do you have the least idea of what that means?It means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,and to bear children for the king."
4527,Joffrey,Sansa,"A prospect that no longer entices you as it once did, I can see."
4528,Robert,Sansa,I screamed so loudly that I fancied Robert might hear me  in the kingswood.His Grace was not with you?Robert?
4529,Jaime,Pycelle,"Not that I wanted him to stay, mind you."
4530,Jaime,Pycelle,"Joffrey will show you no such devotion, I fear."
4531,Joffrey,Sansa,"You may  never love the king, but youll love his children.I love His Grace with all my heart,"
4532,Joffrey,Sansa,"You had best learn some new lies, and quickly.Lord Stannis will not like that one, I  promise you.The new High Septon said that the gods will never permit Lord Stannis to win, since Joffrey is the  rightful king."
4533,Joffrey,Robert,Roberts trueborn son and heir.
4534,Cersei,Tyrion,"Do you want to be loved, Sansa?Everyone wants to be loved.I see flowering hasnt made you any brighter,Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly  wisdom with you on this very special day."
4535,Cersei,Tyrion,"A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the  same."
4536,Jon,Qhorin,"Shadows are friends to men in black,"
4537,Jon,Qhorin,"My lord,you never asked me how it  went."
4538,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.She told you true.She even claimed we were kin."
4539,Jon,Mance,"Aye, and for their women as well.You knew him?We all knew him."
4540,Jon,Qhorin,"Why did he desert?For a wench, some say.For a crown, others would have it."
4541,Jon,Qhorin,"He liked women, Mance did, and he was not a man whose knees bent easily,  thats true."
4542,Small,Thoren,"When he left the Shadow  Tower he was only going home again.Was he a good ranger?He was the best of us,"
4543,Jon,Mance,"He never learned how to obey.No more than me,"
4544,Jon,Qhorin,So you let her go?
4545,Jon,Qhorin,You know?Now.Tell me why you spared her.
4546,Qhorin,Ygritte,My father never used a headsman.
4547,Qhorin,Ygritte,.
4548,Qhorin,Ygritte,"I know she was an enemy, but there was  no evil in her.No more than in the other two.It was their lives or ours Jon said.If they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn ."
4549,Qhorin,Ygritte,".The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough.Stonesnake has the horn now, though, and we took Ygrittes knife and axe."
4550,Qhorin,Ygritte,".And not like to be a threat,If I had needed her dead, I would have left her with  Ebben, or done the thing myself.Then why did you command it of me?I did not command it.I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide what that would  be."
4551,Dalbridge,Qhorin,"When I want a mountain scaled, I call  on Stonesnake."
4552,Ebben,Jon,I know more of you now than I did this morning.And if I had slain her?
4553,Ebben,Jon,"She would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before."
4554,Ebben,Jon,You will need your strength.
4555,Ebben,Jon,"Ghost,Here.To me."
4556,Chett,Jon,"Just dont try and bring down a cat,"
4557,Ebben,Jon,Ghost!
4558,Ebben,Jon,"Ghost, to me!"
4559,Ebben,Jon,Quiet!
4560,Dalbridge,Jon,"Whats  wrong with you, boy?A dream,I was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen  river, and something attacked me."
4561,Dalbridge,Qhorin,.
4562,Dalbridge,Qhorin,Its always pretty women in my dreams.Would that I dreamed more often.
4563,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"A frozen river, you say?The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier,There was a tree with my brothers face."
4564,Jon,Stonesnake,And giants riding mammoths.
4565,Jon,Qhorin,"Tell me all that you remember, from first to last,"
4566,Jon,Qhorin,"It was only a dream.A wolf dream,Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering  at the source of the Milkwater."
4567,Jon,Qhorin,Tell me.
4568,Dalbridge,Ebben,Skinchanger?
4569,Benjen,Dalbridge,The cold winds are rising.
4570,Dalbridge,Ebben,Why should we balk at wargs and giants?Does this mean my dreams are true as well?
4571,Dalbridge,Ebben,"Lord Snow can keep his  mammoths, I want my women.Man and boy Ive served the Watch, and ranged as far as any,Ive seen the bones of    giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more.I want to see them with my own eyes.Be careful they dont see you, Ebben,"
4572,Dalbridge,Jon,"Qhorin,There.Look."
4573,Ebben,Qhorin,The birds well out of  bowshot.I dont like it watching us.
4574,Ebben,Qhorin,"Nor me, but you wont stop it.Only waste a good arrow."
4575,Jon,Qhorin,"We press on,"
4576,Qhorin,Stonesnake,How bad?
4577,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"The wolf is strong,Ebben, water."
4578,Qhorin,Stonesnake,"Hold him still, Jon."
4579,Qhorin,Stonesnake,Do we press on?
4580,Jon,Qhorin,"Back, not on.Back?"
4581,Jon,Qhorin,Eagles have sharper eyes than men.
4582,Jon,Qhorin,So now we run.
4583,Jon,Qhorin,"Ghost, come,"
4584,Ebben,Qhorin,"No fire,"
4585,Dalbridge,Qhorin,"We are not far from the place the wildlings died,From there,  one man could hold a hundred.The right man."
4586,Dalbridge,Qhorin,"Leave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers."
4587,Dalbridge,Qhorin,"And see my garron has an apple when youre home.Hes earned it, poor beastie."
4588,Jon,Qhorin,If the eagle flies down for a look at you .
4589,Dalbridge,Jon,..
4590,Dalbridge,Jon,hell sprout some new feathers.
4591,Jon,Qhorin,Listen.
4592,Jon,Qhorin,"And now they come,"
4593,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord,You had  best read this at once."
4594,Tyrion,Varys,A report from the north.Good news or bad?
4595,Tyrion,Varys,That is not for me to judge.
4596,Tyrion,Varys,"Gods be good,Both of them?I fear so, my lord."
4597,Tyrion,Varys,And them so young and innocent.
4598,Tyrion,Varys,Have you told anyone else?
4599,Tyrion,Varys,"Not as yet, though of course I must."
4600,Cersei,Tyrion,Ill tell my sister.
4601,Cersei,Tyrion,"I trust youre pleased,You wanted the Stark boy dead, I believe."
4602,Cersei,Tyrion,"It was Jaime who threw him from that window, not me."
4603,Cersei,Tyrion,"It was a stupid thing to do, and dangerous besides, but when did our sweet  brother ever stop to think?The boy saw you,He was a child.I could have frightened him into silence."
4604,Jaime,Tyrion,"Why  must I suffer accusations every time some Stark stubs his toe?This was Greyjoys work, I had nothing to  do with it.Let us hope Lady Catelyn believes that."
4605,Jaime,Tyrion,She wouldnt-
4606,Cersei,Jaime,What would you do if Joffrey and Tommen were murdered?I still hold Sansa!
4607,Cersei,Jaime,"We still hold Sansa,and we had best take good care of her."
4608,Petyr,Tyrion,Weve had no word from Bitterbridge?
4609,Petyr,Tyrion,"None.Ive never trusted Petyr.For enough coin, hed go over to Stannis in a heartbeat.Stannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men."
4610,Petyr,Tyrion,No.We have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig.A token of her love?A bribe.
4611,Cersei,Tyrion,"I suspect she fears youll arrest her on the road, as you did Lord Gyles.Does she plan to make off with the heir to the throne?"
4612,Cersei,Tyrion,Id sooner she remain.
4613,Cersei,Tyrion,"As many men as she has.If we need men so badly, why did you send away your savages?"
4614,Cersei,Tyrion,"It was the best use I could have made of them,Theyre fierce warriors, but not  soldiers."
4615,Cersei,Tyrion,Theyve already done us more good  in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city walls.
4616,Cersei,Robert,"Why are we plagued with so many treasons?What injury has House  Lannister ever done these wretches?None,"
4617,Cersei,Robert,which makes them fools as well as  traitors.Are you certain youve found them all?Varys says so.
4618,Cersei,Robert,You put too much trust in that  eunuch.He serves me well.Or so hed have you believe.
4619,Robert,Varys,.
4620,Robert,Varys,He says you mean to take the Hound from Joffrey.
4621,Robert,Varys,"I need Clegane for more important duties.Nothing is more important than the life of the king.The life of the king is not at risk.Joffrey will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him, and Meryn Trant as  well."
4622,Robert,Varys,"I need Balon Swann and the Hound to lead sorties, to make  certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater.Jaime would lead the sorties himself.From Riverrun?Thats quite a sortie.Joffreys only a boy.A boy who wants to be part of this battle, and for once hes showing some sense."
4623,Joffrey,Varys,"Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares  their peril than one who hides behind his mothers skirts.Hes thirteen, Tyrion.Remember Jaime at thirteen?"
4624,Gyles,Joffrey,"If the city looks  to be in the least danger of falling, Ill have him escorted back to the Red Keep at once."
4625,Gyles,Joffrey,Will the city  fall?No.
4626,Cersei,Gyles,"Youve lied to me before, Tyrion.Always with good reason, sweet sister."
4627,Cersei,Gyles,Ive decided to  release Lord Gyles.
4628,Cersei,Gyles,You can have Ser Boros Blount back  as well.
4629,Cersei,Gyles,"Ser Boros can rot at Rosby,but Tommen-Hes safer under Lord Jacelyns protection than he would ever have been with Lord  Gyles."
4630,Cersei,Tyrion,"I hope you like  blackberry tarts.I love all sorts of tarts.Oh, Ive known that a long while.Do you know why Varys is so dangerous? Are we playing at riddles now?No.He doesnt have a cock.Neither do you."
4631,Cersei,Tyrion,Perhaps Im dangerous too.
4632,Cersei,Tyrion,That worm  between your legs does half your thinking.
4633,Cersei,Tyrion,"Yes, and just now my worm is  thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave.Are you unwell, brother?"
4634,Cersei,Tyrion,Suddenly you appear somewhat flustered.Flustered?
4635,Shae,Tyrion,"Youve never shown much interest in my cock before.Its not your cock that interests me, so much as what you stick it in."
4636,Shae,Tyrion,especially things that people dont  want me to know.What are you trying to say?Only this-I have your little whore.
4637,Shae,Tyrion,"I thought men were more to  your taste.Youre such a droll little fellow.Tell me, have you married this one yet?Father will be ever so relieved."
4638,Myrcella,Tommen,"Why should you  care who I choose to warm my bed?A Lannister always pays his debts,Youve been scheming against me since the day you  came to Kings Landing."
4639,Joffrey,Tommen,You  want him dead so you can rule through Tommen.
4640,Joffrey,Stannis,"This is madness, Cersei."
4641,Joffrey,Stannis,"You  need me.For what?Your great prowess in battle?Bronns sellswords will never fight without me,Oh, I think they will."
4642,Shae,Stannis,"I wont say I havent thought of slitting your throat from time to time, but Jaime would never  forgive me if I did.And the whore?"
4643,Shae,Tyrion,"Shell be treated gently enough, so long as no harm comes to my sons.If Joffrey should be killed, however,  or if Tommen should fall into the hands of our enemies, your little cunt will die more painfully than you can  possibly imagine.The boys are safe,Gods  be good, Cersei, theyre my own blood!What sort of man do you take me for?A small and twisted one."
4644,Cersei,Osmund,"For all I know, youve killed her already,Would you like to see her?I thought you might."
4645,Osmund,Osney,Bring in my brothers whore.
4646,Cersei,Osney,You said she wouldnt be hurt.She fought.
4647,Cersei,Tyrion,"Got claws like a shadowcat, this one.Bruises heal,The whore will live.So long as Joffrey does."
4648,Bronn,Cersei,"You swear youll release her after the battle?If you release Tommen, yes."
4649,Bronn,Cersei,"Keep her then, but keep her safe."
4650,Bronn,Cersei,"well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways."
4651,Cersei,Tyrion,"Whatever happens to her happens to Tornmen as well, and  that includes the beatings and rapes."
4652,Cersei,Tyrion,You would not dare.
4653,Osfryd,Tyrion,Dare?Ill do it  myself.
4654,Osfryd,Tyrion,"One more step and Ill break her arm,"
4655,Osfryd,Tyrion,"You remember when I said youd never hit me again, Cersei?"
4656,Osfryd,Tyrion,Untie her and remove that gag.
4657,Alayaya,Tyrion,"Sweetling,you must be  brave."
4658,Alayaya,Tyrion,"I have  never liked you, Cersei, but you were my own sister, so I never did you harm."
4659,Cersei,Tyrion,"A day will come when you think yourself safe  and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and youll know the debt is paid."
4660,Cersei,Tyrion,Get out!
4661,Cersei,Tyrion,Get out of my sight!
4662,Cersei,Tyrion,"Good night, then.And pleasant dreams."
4663,Shae,Tyrion,What are you doing here?
4664,Joffrey,Tyrion,I wanted some hands on my titties .
4665,Joffrey,Tyrion,but these little gold ones are  cold.
4666,Alayaya,Joffrey,The Lady Lollys-
4667,Alayaya,Tyrion,"The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in it, and I have to clean  her."
4668,Alayaya,Tyrion,"All they did was fuck her.Her mother says shes sick.She has a baby in her belly, thats all."
4669,Shae,Tyrion,How did you enter?Show me the  hidden door.
4670,Shae,Tyrion,Lord Varys made me wear a hood.
4671,Shae,Tyrion,"It was all tiles, you know, the kind that make a  picture?A mosaic?"
4672,Shae,Tyrion,They were colored red and black.
4673,Shae,Tyrion,"I had to stoop, and I think Lord Varys  was crawling."
4674,Shae,Tyrion,Doesnt mlord want to bed me?
4675,Shae,Tyrion,In a moment.
4676,Cersei,Shae,"Your shoulders feel as hard as rocks,Hurry, I want to feel you inside me."
4677,Cersei,Shae,Whats wrong?
4678,Cersei,Shae,"Just go to sleep, sweetling,"
4679,Brienne,Catelyn,"Brienne, I am no fit company."
4680,Brienne,Catelyn,"Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymunds harping.I am not made for revels, my lady."
4681,Brienne,Catelyn,"If you command it, I ."
4682,Brienne,Catelyn,.
4683,Brienne,Catelyn,I only thought you might enjoy happier company than mine.Im well content.
4684,Brienne,Catelyn,There was another bird this morning.
4685,Brienne,Catelyn,The maester woke me at  once.
4686,Brienne,Catelyn,Not kind at all.
4687,Brienne,Catelyn,Is it news of Kings Landing?
4688,Brienne,Catelyn,"Would that it was.The bird came from Castle Cerwyn, from Ser Rodrik, my castellan."
4689,Brienne,Catelyn,"He has gathered what power he could and is marching on Winterfell, to take the castle  back."
4690,Brienne,Catelyn,But he said .
4691,Brienne,Catelyn,".My lady, what is it?Is it some news of your sons?"
4692,Brienne,Catelyn,I have no sons but Robb.
4693,Brienne,Theon,"My lady?Bran and Rickon tried to escape, but were taken at a mill on the Acorn Water."
4694,Brienne,Theon,"Theon Greyjoy, who ate at my table since he was a boy  of ten."
4695,Catelyn,Rickon,I .
4696,Catelyn,Rickon,theyre with the gods now.Are they?
4697,Catelyn,Rickon,What god would let this happen?
4698,Bran,Brienne,"Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again."
4699,Bran,Brienne,These scars .
4700,Bran,Brienne,"He would have died then, and  me with him, but Brans wolf tore out the mans throat."
4701,Bran,Robb,I suppose  Theon killed the wolves too.
4702,Brienne,Robb,But my daughters have no wolves now.
4703,Brienne,Robb,Your daughters .
4704,Brienne,Robb,".Sansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please."
4705,Arya,Eddard,"And Arya, well ."
4706,Jaime,Theon,I think she must be dead too.
4707,Jaime,Theon,"I want them all dead, Brienne."
4708,Brienne,Cersei,.The queen .
4709,Chett,Jacelyn, Brienne said awkwardly.
4710,Catelyn,Robb,.Send my daughters back unharmed?
4711,Catelyn,Robb,"There is a sweet innocence about you,    child."
4712,Brienne,Eddard,"But I would, oh, yes."
4713,Brienne,Cleos,Ive sent him wine.Wine?
4714,Brienne,Cleos,Robb?
4715,Brienne,Cleos,Theon Greyjoy?The Kingslayer.
4716,Catelyn,Jaime,"I would like you to come with me.I am yours to command, my lady.Good."
4717,Catelyn,Jaime,"Stay, finish your meal in peace."
4718,Catelyn,Hoster,"At midnight.So late, my lady?The dungeons are windowless.One hour is much like another down there, and for me, all hours are  midnight."
4719,Catelyn,Hoster,Tully!A cup!
4720,Hoster,Vyman,"He had a cup of drearnwine not so long ago, my lady,For the pain.He will not know you are here.It makes no matter,"
4721,Bran,Rickon,"My lady, is there aught I might do for you?A sleeping draught, perhaps?Thank you, Maester, but no."
4722,Rickon,Vyman,"Go and join the celebration, I will sit with my father for a time.As you will, my lady."
4723,Hoster,Vyman,"I have no one to talk with, Father,I pray, but the gods do not answer."
4724,Lysa,Petyr,Last night I dreamed of that  time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard.
4725,Petyr,Robb,"But theres no one to find me now, is there?"
4726,Petyr,Robb,I keep remembering the Stark words.
4727,Catelyn,Rickon,.
4728,Catelyn,Rickon,"I want,"
4729,Brienne,Catelyn,"I  loved a maid as red as autumn,with sunset in her hair."
4730,Brienne,Catelyn,"MY lady,Midnight has come."
4731,Brienne,Catelyn,"Begging  your forgiveness, mlady, but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from  him, with his seal upon it.Lord Edmure?Has my father died, and no one told me?"
4732,Brienne,Catelyn,"No, mlady, not as I knows.You will open the cell, or you will come with me to Lord Hosters solar and tell him why you saw fit to  defy me."
4733,Brienne,Catelyn,As mlady says.
4734,Brienne,Catelyn,"Go back to your ale and leave us,"
4735,Brienne,Catelyn,"Brienne, see that I am not disturbed."
4736,Brienne,Catelyn,My lady will call if she has need of me.
4737,Chett,Jaime,"Lady Stark,I fear I am in no condition to receive you.Look at me, ser.The light hurts my eyes.A moment, if you would."
4738,Catelyn,Jaime,I see you had no taste for the wine I sent you.Such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect.I can have your head off anytime I want.Why would I need to poison you?Death by poison can seem natural.Harder to claim that my head simply fell off.
4739,Catelyn,Chett,"Id invite you to sit, but your  brother has neglected to provide me a chair.I can stand well enough.Can you?"
4740,Catelyn,Chett,Though perhaps its just the light in here.
4741,Catelyn,Chett,"Are my bracelets heavy enough for you, or did you come to add a few  more?Ill rattle them prettily if you like.You brought this on yourself,We granted you the comfort of a tower cell befitting  your birth and station.You repaid us by trying to escape.A cell is a cell."
4742,Catelyn,Jaime,One day perhaps Ill  show them to you.
4743,Catelyn,Jaime,"A man chained hand and foot should keep a more  courteous tongue in his mouth, ser.I did not come here to be threatened.No?"
4744,Catelyn,Jaime,Pour us some of that wine and slip  out of that gown and well see if Im up to it.
4745,Catelyn,Jaime,"If you  said that in my sons hearing, he would kill you for it.Only so long as I was wearing these."
4746,Catelyn,Jaime,"We both know the boy  is afraid to face me in single combat.My son may be young, but if you take him for a fool, you are sadly mistaken ."
4747,Catelyn,Jaime,"and it seems to me    that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back.Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers skirts as well? I grow weary of this, ser.There are things I must know.Why should I tell you anything?To save your life.You think I fear death?"
4748,Catelyn,Jaime,"You should.Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells, if the  gods are just.What gods are those, Lady Catelyn?"
4749,Catelyn,Jaime,How well did they serve him  when my sister took his head off?
4750,Catelyn,Jaime,"If there are gods, why is the world so full of  pain and injustice?Because of men like you.There are no men like me.Theres only me."
4751,Cersei,Jaime,"If you will not speak with  me, so be it.Drink the wine or piss in it, ser, it makes no matter to me.Lady Stark."
4752,Cersei,Jaime,"Things go to rust in this  damp,Even a mans courtesies."
4753,Cersei,Jaime,for a price.
4754,Cersei,Jaime,"Captives do not set prices.Oh, youll find mine modest enough."
4755,Catelyn,Cersei,"Answer my  questions and Ill answer yours.Truthfully? Oh, its truth you want?"
4756,Catelyn,Cersei,"Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth, but  seldom like the taste when its served up.I am strong enough to hear anything you care to say.As you will, then."
4757,Catelyn,Jaime,My throat is raw.
4758,Catelyn,Jaime,"Sour and vile,but it will do."
4759,Catelyn,Jaime,"Your first question, Lady Catelyn?"
4760,Catelyn,Jaime,Are you Joffreys father?You would never ask unless you knew the answer.I want it from your own lips.
4761,Catelyn,Jaime,"Joffrey is mine.As are the rest of Cerseis brood, I suppose.You admit to being your sisters lover?Ive always loved my sister, and you owe me two answers.Do all my kin still live?Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross, I am told."
4762,Cersei,Jaime,"Uncle Dolt, my sister called him."
4763,Cersei,Tyrion,"As well  as my lord father.They live, all three."
4764,Catelyn,Jaime,Ask your next.
4765,Catelyn,Jaime,How did my son  Bran come to fall?I flung him from a window.
4766,Catelyn,Jaime,"You were a knight, sworn to  defend the weak and innocent.He was weak enough, but perhaps not so innocent."
4767,Catelyn,Jaime,"Bran would not spy.Then blame those precious gods of yours, who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse  of something he was never meant to see.Blame the gods?"
4768,Catelyn,Jaime,Yours was the hand that threw him.You meant for him to die.
4769,Catelyn,Jaime,"I seldom fling children from towers to improve their health.Yes, I meant for  him to die.And when he did not, you knew your danger was worse than ever, so you gave your catspaw a bag of  silver to make certain Bran would never wake.Did I now?"
4770,Catelyn,Jaime,"I wont deny we talked of it, but you were  with the boy day and night, your  maester and Lord Eddard attended him frequently, and there were guards, even those damned  direwolves ."
4771,Catelyn,Jaime,"And why bother, when  the boy seemed like to die of his own accord?If you lie to me, this session is at an end."
4772,Catelyn,Jaime,The man who came to slit Brans throat gave me these scars.You swear you had no part in  sending him? On my honor as a Lannister.Your honor as a Lannister is worth less than this.
4773,Catelyn,Jaime,"I may indeed have shit for  honor, I wont deny it, but I have never yet hired anyone to do my killing.Believe what you will, Lady  Stark, but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself."
4774,Catelyn,Jaime,"If you did not send the killer, your sister did.If so, Id know.Cersei keeps no secrets from me.Then it was the Imp.Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran.He wasnt climbing around outside of anyones window, spying.Then why did the assassin have his dagger?What dagger was this?It was so long,plain, but finely made, with a blade of Valyrian steel  and a dragonbone hilt."
4775,Catelyn,Loras,This wine seems to be improving as I  drink it.
4776,Catelyn,Loras,How?Wagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers.
4777,Catelyn,Loras,No .
4778,Catelyn,Loras,"was it the other way?Tyrion always backed me in the lists,"
4779,Moon,Tyrion,And when was he not drunk?
4780,Jaime,Tyrion,Are you trying to deceive me?
4781,Jaime,Tyrion,"Ive admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window, what would it gain me to lie about this  knife?"
4782,Jaime,Tyrion,"Believe what you will, Im past caring what people say of  me."
4783,Jaime,Tyrion,"Have Roberts brothers taken the field?They have.Now theres a niggardly response.Give me more than that, or your next answer will be as poor.Stannis marches against Kings Landing,Renly is dead, murdered at Bitterbridge  by his brother, through some black art I do not understand.A pity,I rather liked Renly, though Stannis is quite another tale.What side have the Tyrells  taken?Renly, at first.Now, I could not say.Your boy must be feeling lonely.Robb was sixteen a few days past ."
4784,Catelyn,Jaime,"The  last word we had from him, he had taken the Crag from the Westerlings.He hasnt faced my father yet, has he?When he does, hell defeat him.As he did you.He took me unawares.A cravens trick.You dare talk of tricks?Your brother Tyrion sent us cutthroats in envoys garb, under a peace banner.If it were one of your sons in this cell, wouldnt his brothers do as much for him?"
4785,Catelyn,Jaime,"Whats a brothers life when honor is at stake, eh?"
4786,Catelyn,Rickard,Tyrion  is clever enough to realize that your son will never consent to ransom me.
4787,Catelyn,Rickard,Robbs bannermen would sooner see you dead.
4788,Jaime,Rickard,"You slew two of his sons in the Whispering Wood.The two with the white sunburst, were they?"
4789,Jaime,Rickard,"If truth be told, it was your son that I  was trying to slay."
4790,Jaime,Rickard,"Any other  knight would have done the same.How can you still count yourself a knight, when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore?"
4791,Jaime,Rickard,So many vows .
4792,Jaime,Rickard,"No matter what you do, youre forsaking one vow or the other."
4793,Eddard,Jaime,"I was the youngest man ever to wear the white cloak.And the youngest to betray all it stood for, Kingslayer.Kingslayer, And such a king he was!"
4794,Eddard,Jaime,"To Aerys  Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
4795,Eddard,Jaime,"Those are the Lannister colors, red and gold."
4796,Eddard,Jaime,"Only a man like you would be proud of such an act.I told you, there are no men like me."
4797,Eddard,Jaime,"Or his brothers? They strangled Brandon while his father watched, and then killed Lord Rickard as well."
4798,Eddard,Jaime,"Killed, yes, but how?The cord or the axe, I suppose."
4799,Eddard,Jaime,No doubt Eddard wished to spare you.
4800,Jaime,Lyanna,Ask.Dead is dead.
4801,Jaime,Lyanna,"Brandon was different from his brother, wasnt he?"
4802,Jaime,Lyanna,More like me.Brandon was nothing like you.If you say so.  
4803,Brandon,Lyanna,.
4804,Brandon,Lyanna,.
4805,Brandon,Lyanna,It was a rash thing to  do.
4806,Aerys,Jaime,"He rode into the Red Keep with a few companions, shouting for  Prince Rhaegar to come out and die."
4807,Aerys,Catelyn,"The others were lords sons too, it seems to me.Ethan Glover was Brandons squire,He was the only one to survive.The others were  Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce, and Elbert Arryn, Jon Arryns nephew and heir."
4808,Catelyn,Rickard,"Aerys accused them of treason and summoned their  fathers to court to answer the charge, with the sons as hostages."
4809,Catelyn,Rickard,Fathers and sons both.There were trials.
4810,Aerys,Rickard,"When the fire was blazing, Brandon was brought in."
4811,Aerys,Brandon,"The pyromancers roasted Lord Rickard slowly, banking and fanning that fire carefully to get a nice even  heat."
4812,Brandon,Cersei,"As for Lord Rickard, the steel of his breastplate turned cherry-red before the end, and his gold melted  off his spurs and dripped down into the fire."
4813,Catelyn,Gerold,"That was the White Bull, loyal to the  end and a better man than me, all agree.Aerys ."
4814,Catelyn,Gerold,.
4815,Catelyn,Robert,"Aerys was mad, the whole realm knew it, but if you would have me believe you slew him  to avenge Brandon Stark ."
4816,Catelyn,Robert,.I made no such claim.
4817,Jaime,Robert,"He was never unfaithful to Robert, was he?"
4818,Jaime,Petyr,"Come, Lady  Stark, dont you find this all terribly amusing?I find nothing about you amusing, Kingslayer.That name again."
4819,Eddard,Petyr,"Besides, youre not half so lovely as my sister."
4820,Eddard,Petyr,Ive never lain with  any woman but Cersei.
4821,Catelyn,Eddard,What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
4822,Catelyn,Jaime,"Brienne.No, that wasnt it."
4823,Brienne,Jaime,"Snow, that was the one."
4824,Brienne,Catelyn,like the pretty cloaks they give us in the  Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.
4825,Brienne,Catelyn,"You called, my lady?Give me your sword."
4826,Reek,Theon,What?
4827,Reek,Theon,What do you want?
4828,Reek,Theon,"Why? My lord prince,your sister has come to Winterfell."
4829,Asha,Theon,Where is she?Lorren took her and her men to the Great Hall to break their fast.Will you see her now?Yes.
4830,Asha,Theon,"Wex, hot water."
4831,Asha,Theon,Close the shutters.
4832,Chett,Theon,"This was never what I wanted,They gave me no choice."
4833,Chett,Theon,Mlord Eddard always did his own killings.
4834,Eddard,Theon,"They fear  no foe in open battle,but it is another thing to dwell among enemies, never  knowing if the washerwoman means to kiss you or kill you, or whether the serving boy is filling your cup  with ale or bale."
4835,Asha,Theon,"This is my seat, no man will drive me from it.No,  nor woman either!"
4836,Reek,Theon,Where are the rest?
4837,Asha,Theon,"This is the whole o the company, mlord prince.The whole-how many men did she bring?Twenty, by my count."
4838,Asha,Theon,"Why, tis the Prince of Winterfell."
4839,Asha,Theon,Or is it Prince of Fools?Envy ill becomes a maid.
4840,Asha,Theon,"Envy, Theon?What else would you call it?"
4841,Asha,Theon,"You needed a thousand  and a moons turn to take Deepwood Motte.Well, Im no great warrior like you, brother,I saw the heads above your gates.Tell me true, which one gave you the fiercest  fight, the cripple or the babe?"
4842,Luwin,Theon,"No,Not the crypts.But why, my lord?"
4843,Bran,Theon,  
4844,Asha,Bran,"I treated Bran and Rickon generously,They brought their fate on themselves.As do we all, little brother."
4845,Asha,Bran,"How do you expect me to hold Winterfell if you bring me only twenty  men?Ten,The others return with me."
4846,Asha,Bran,There are direwolves prowling the dark.
4847,Asha,Theon,"Come, let us go somewhere we can speak more  privily."
4848,Asha,Rodrik,"Dagmers lost the fight at Torrhens Square-The old castellan broke his shield wall, yes,What did you expect?"
4849,Dagmer,Theon,Hes leading the survivors back toward the Stony Shore.
4850,Dagmer,Theon,The victory has given Leobald  Tallhart the courage to come out from behind his walls and join Ser Rodrik.
4851,Dagmer,Theon,"Ill have an army at my gates before the moon turns,  and you bring me only ten men?I need not have brought you any.I commanded you-Father commanded me to take Deepwood Motte,He said nothing of me having to  rescue my little brother.Bugger Deepwood,Its a wooden pisspot on a hill.Winterfell is the heart of the land, but how  am I to hold it without a garrison? You might have thought of that before you took it."
4852,Dagmer,Theon,"If only youd  had the good sense to raze the castle and carry the two little princelings back to Pyke as hostages, you  might have won the war in a stroke.Youd like that, wouldnt you?To see my prize reduced to ruins and ashes.Your prize will be the doom of you."
4853,Asha,Theon,You made certain of that when you mounted those heads  on your gatehouse.
4854,Asha,Theon,How could you be such a bloody fool?
4855,Asha,Theon,.They defied me!
4856,Asha,Theon,"And it was blood for blood besides, two sons of Eddard  Stark to pay for Rodrik and Maron."
4857,Asha,Theon,"Ive laid my brothers ghosts to rest.Our brothers,Did you bring their ghosts from Pyke, brother?And here I thought they haunted only Father.When has a maid ever understood a mans need for revenge?"
4858,Asha,Theon,"This Ser Rodrik may well feel the same manly need, did you think of that?"
4859,Asha,Theon,to the torch and fall back while you still can.No.
4860,Asha,Theon,I took this castle and I mean to hold it.
4861,Asha,Theon,"Then hold it you shall,for the rest of your life."
4862,Bran,Theon,"I say it tastes like folly, but what would a shy maid know of such things?"
4863,Bran,Theon,"You ought to know, thats the ugliest crown Ive ever laid eyes on.Did you  make it yourself?"
4864,Reek,Theon,"Gone, has she?"
4865,Asha,Theon,"Mlord prince, if youll pardon me saying, its not right for her to abandon you.And ten men, that wont  be near enough.I am well aware of that,"
4866,Asha,Reek,"Well, might be I could help you,Give me a horse and bag o coin, and I could find you  some good fellows."
4867,Reek,Theon,"How many?A hundred, might be."
4868,Reek,Theon,Maybe more.
4869,Reek,Theon,"I was born up  north here.I know many a man, and many a man knows Reek."
4870,Reek,Theon,"Do as you say and youll not find me ungrateful.You can name your own reward.Well, mlord, I havent had no woman since I was with Lord Ramsay,Ive had my eye on  that Palla, and I hear shes already been had, so ."
4871,Reek,Theon,.
4872,Reek,Theon,Two hundred men and shes yours.But a man less    and you can go back to fucking pigs.
4873,Luwin,Theon,"A dream,that was all it was."
4874,Asha,Theon,Get out.
4875,Mandon,Tyrion,"Lady Sansa,surely my sister has asked you to  join the other highborn ladies in Maegors?She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.I mean to visit the sept as well, to pray.I wont ask for whom."
4876,Lollys,Tanda,"I dont want to, I dont want to, I dont  want to.The battle is begun,I dont want to, I dont want to."
4877,Sansa,Tanda,May I be of help?
4878,Lollys,Tanda,"No, my lady, but we thank you kindly.You must forgive my daughter,  she has not been well.I dont want to."
4879,Lollys,Sansa,"Please, please, I dont want to."
4880,Lollys,Sansa,"Well all be thrice protected inside, and theres to be food and drink and  song as well."
4881,Lollys,Sansa,"I  dont want to.You have to,and that is the end of it."
4882,Sansa,Tanda,"Shes been sick,"
4883,Ilyn,Osfryd,What is he doing here?
4884,Ilyn,Osfryd,Her Grace expects shell have need of him before the nights done. 
4885,Cersei,Ilyn,"All rise for Her Grace, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm,"
4886,Osfryd,Sansa,"Be seated,and be welcome."
4887,Cersei,Sansa,"You look pale, Sansa,Is your red flower still blooming?IYes.How apt.The men will bleed out there, and you in here."
4888,Cersei,Sansa,Why is Ser Ilyn here?
4889,Cersei,Sansa,"To deal with treason, and to defend us if need be.He was a  knight before he was a headsman."
4890,Sandor,Sansa,"When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad  of him."
4891,Osfryd,Sandor,Wont your guards protect us?And who will protect us from my guards?
4892,Osfryd,Sandor,Loyal sellswords  are rare as virgin whores.
4893,Aemon,Sansa,"All you know of life you learned from singers, and  theres such a dearth of good sacking songs.True knights would never harm women and children."
4894,Aemon,Sansa,True knights.
4895,Aemon,Sansa,No doubt youre right.
4896,Aemon,Beth,Im sure it wont be very long now.
4897,Beth,Davos,"Bring down the sail,Lower mast.Oarsmen to your oars."
4898,Chett,Davos,"Out oars,Form line."
4899,Chett,Davos,"Slow cruise,"
4900,Alla,Allar,"A  place of honor,A place of peril,"
4901,Joffrey,Stannis,the boys toys
4902,Davos,Stannis,"A small spoon of victory is just the  thing to settle the stomach before battle,It makes the men hungry for a  larger helping."
4903,Alla,Davos,"Keep line,"
4904,Davos,Salladhor,"Fast cruise,"
4905,Alla,Davos,"Battle speed,"
4906,Alla,Davos,Captain ser.
4907,Alla,Davos,Your helm.
4908,Chett,Jacelyn,"Your Grace, if the  sorceress is with us, afterward men will say it was her victory, not yours."
4909,Alys,Davos,"Loose,"
4910,Beth,Davos,Ramming speed!
4911,Beth,Davos,"Back water,"
4912,Alys,Davos,Wildfire!
4913,Alys,Davos,"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off,"
4914,Beth,Davos,"Hard to starboard,"
4915,Beth,Davos,Board her!
4916,Beth,Davos,"Captain ser, the Hart is ours."
4917,Davos,Stannis,Captain ser!
4918,Chett,Davos,"No, No, NOOOOOOOO!"
4919,Beth,Davos,"Back water,Away.Get us off her, back water, back water!"
4920,Joffrey,Varys,My ships.
4921,Joffrey,Varys,"My Kingslanders  burning, Queen Cersei, Loyal Man.Look, thats Seaflower, there."
4922,Stannis,Tyrion,"It could  not be helped,Our fleet was doomed in any case."
4923,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Tell Lord Jacelyn weve got enemy on the riverfront,Bring my compliments to Ser Arneld  and ask him to swing the Whores thirty degrees west."
4924,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Mother promised I could have the Whores,"
4925,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Keep that closed, Your Grace; your sweet person is precious to us all."
4926,Joffrey,Stannis,The Whores are yours.
4927,Joffrey,Meryn,"Be quick about it, Your Grace,Well want the trebuchets throwing stones again soon enough.Even wildfire does not burn  forever."
4928,Osmund,Tyrion,"Whatever happens, keep him safe and keep him there, is that understood?As you command."
4929,Alayaya,Joffrey,"Iimy lord, hurry!"
4930,Joffrey,Podrick,"Theyve landed men on the tourney grounds, hundreds!Theyre bringing a ram up to the  Kings Gate."
4931,Sandor,Tyrion,"Form up,"
4932,Sandor,Tyrion,Who  commands here?Youre going out.No.
4933,Sandor,Tyrion,Yes.
4934,Sandor,Tyrion,Bugger that.And you.
4935,Sandor,Tyrion,We been out.
4936,Sandor,Tyrion,  
4937,Sandor,Tyrion,"You too, dog."
4938,Sandor,Tyrion,"Theyve  taken a ram to the gate, you can hear them, we need to disperse them-Open the gates."
4939,Mandon,Tyrion,Ive lost half my men.
4940,Mandon,Tyrion,Im not taking more into that fire.
4941,Mandon,Tyrion,The Kings Hand  commands you.Bugger the Kings Hand.
4942,Mandon,Tyrion,Someone bring me a drink.
4943,Mandon,Tyrion,Water?
4944,Mandon,Tyrion,Bring me wine.
4945,Mandon,Tyrion,"Very well, Ill  lead the sortie."
4946,Mandon,Tyrion,You?
4947,Mandon,Tyrion,Me.
4948,Mandon,Sandor,"Pod, my  helm."
4949,Mandon,Tyrion,Form up!
4950,Stannis,Tyrion,"They say Im half a man,What does that make the lot of you?"
4951,Stannis,Tyrion,"You wont hear me shout out Joffreys name,You  wont hear me yell for Casterly Rock either."
4952,Stannis,Tyrion,So come with me and kill the son of a bitch!
4953,Osfryd,Sansa,The fleets are locked in battle.
4954,Cersei,Sansa,"Baelors Sept is jammed full, everyone praying.And my son?The king went to Baelors to get the High Septons blessing.Now hes walking the walls with the Hand,  telling the men to be brave, lifting their spirits as it were."
4955,Lancel,Sansa,"Tears,The womans weapon, my lady mother used to call them."
4956,Joffrey,Sansa,"And that tells us all you need to know, doesnt it?Men must be very brave, though,To ride out and face swords and axes, everyone trying  to kill you ."
4957,Joffrey,Sansa,.Jaime told me once that he only feels truly alive in battle and in bed.
4958,Joffrey,Sansa,"I would sooner face any number of swords than sit helpless like this,  pretending to enjoy the company of this flock of frightened hens.You asked them here, Your Grace.Certain things are expected of a queen."
4959,Cersei,Joffrey,Best  learn.
4960,Cersei,Joffrey,"Of themselves the  hens are nothing, but their cocks are important for one reason or another, and some may survive this  battle."
4961,Cersei,Stannis,"if my wretched dwarf of a brother should  somehow manage to prevail, they will return to their husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I  was, how my courage inspired them and lifted their spirits, how I never doubted our victory even for a  moment.And if the castle should fall?Youd like that, wouldnt you?"
4962,Cersei,Stannis,"If Im not betrayed by my own guards,  I may be able to hold here for a time."
4963,Sansa,Stannis,"And you should never rule out mutilation, torture, and murder at times like these."
4964,Sansa,Stannis,"These are women, unarmed, and gently born.Their birth protects them,"
4965,Sansa,Stannis,"Me?Try not to sound so like a mouse, Sansa."
4966,Sansa,Stannis,And betrothed to  my firstborn.
4967,Sansa,Stannis,"Were it anyone else outside the gates, I might hope to  beguile him."
4968,Sansa,Stannis,Id have a better chance of seducing his horse.
4969,Sansa,Stannis,"Have I shocked you, my lady?"
4970,Sansa,Stannis,You little fool.
4971,Osmund,Sansa,Both kinds of swords.
4972,Osmund,Osney,"The hulks have gone up, YGrace."
4973,Osmund,Osney,"A hundred ships burning, maybe more.And my son?Hes at the Mud Gate with the Hand and the Kingsguard, YGrace."
4974,Cersei,Osfryd,"All agree, hes a right brave  boy.Hed best remain a right live boy."
4975,Cersei,Osfryd,"Yes?YGrace,the boys caught a groom and two maidservants  trying to sneak out a postern with three of the kings horses.The nights first traitors,but not the last, I fear."
4976,Osfryd,Sansa,"Another lesson  you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son."
4977,Lollys,Sansa,"The only way to keep your people loyal is to  make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.I will remember, Your Grace,"
4978,Gyles,Osfryd,"The gods must have been mad to  waste manhood on the likes of him, and I must have been mad to demand his release."
4979,Gyles,Osfryd,"Theres folks gathering in the square, YGrace,  asking to take refuge in the castle.Not a mob, rich merchants and the like.Command them to return to their homes,If they wont go, have our crossbowmen kill  a few.No sorties; I wont have the gates opened for any reason.As you command."
4980,Jaime,Osfryd,Would that I could take a sword to their necks myself.
4981,Jaime,Osfryd,"When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father  could not tell us apart."
4982,Cersei,Sansa,"Jaimes lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood.But you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms,When it comes to swords, a queen is only a woman after all."
4983,Cersei,Osney,No more.I must keep a clear head.
4984,Osmund,Osney,"YGrace,Stannis has  landed men on the tourney grounds, and theres more coming across."
4985,Cersei,Osmund,"The Imps gone out to drive them off.That will fill them with fear,He hasnt taken Joffrey, I hope.No, YGrace, the kings with my brother at the Whores, flinging Antler Men into the river.With the Mud Gate under assault?"
4986,Cersei,Osmund,Fetch him back to the castle.The Imp said-Its what I said that ought concern you.
4987,Cersei,Osmund,"Your brother will do as hes told, or  Ill see to it that he leads the next sortie himself, and youll go with him."
4988,Aemon,Sansa,"Very good, dear."
4989,Dontos,Sansa,You want to practice those tears.Youll need them for  King Stannis.
4990,Dontos,Sansa,"Your Grace?Oh, spare me your hollow courtesies."
4991,Dontos,Sansa,I know all about your little treasons  in the godswood.The godswood?
4992,Dontos,Florian,Ive done no treasons.I only visit the  godswood to pray.For Stannis.
4993,Florian,Sansa,"What would you call that, if not treason?I pray for Joffrey,Why, because he treats you so sweetly?"
4994,Cersei,Sansa,"Drink,Perhaps it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change."
4995,Cersei,Sansa,"You can do better than that,Drain the cup, Sansa.Your queen commands you."
4996,Cersei,Sansa,More?
4997,Cersei,Sansa,No.Please.
4998,Cersei,Sansa,"When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you."
4999,Cersei,Sansa,Would you like to know why hes really here?
5000,Cersei,Ilyn,"Tell Lady Sansa why I  keep you by us,"
5001,Ilyn,Sansa,"Hes here for us, he says,Stannis may take the city and he may take the throne, but I  will not suffer him to judge me.I do not mean for him to have us alive.us?You heard me."
5002,Ilyn,Sansa,"The Starks  will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you."
5003,Mandon,Tyrion,"Wedge,"
5004,Podrick,Tyrion,"Youre too young,Go  back.Im your squire, my lord."
5005,Podrick,Tyrion,"With me, then.Stay close."
5006,Chett,Tyrion,"Lances,"
5007,Mandon,Tyrion,Kings Landing!
5008,Lancel,Mandon,"Well ride  for the Mud Gate,The Mud Gate!"
5009,Lancel,Mandon,Kings Landing!Halfman!
5010,Jaime,Tyrion,Lannister!
5011,Chett,Jacelyn,Halfman!
5012,Jaime,Tyrion,"You dont feel  your wounds then, or the ache in your back from the weight of the armor, or the sweat running down into    your eyes.You stop feeling, you stop thinking, you stop being you, there is only the fight, the foe, this  man and then the next and the next and the next, and you know they are afraid and tired but youre not,  youre alive, and death is all around you but their swords move so slowly, you can dance through them  laughing."
5013,Stannis,Tyrion,"I yield, ser,Yield."
5014,Stannis,Tyrion,"My  pledge, here, here."
5015,Mandon,Tyrion,"Yield,"
5016,Balon,Tyrion,"My lord, look."
5017,Squint,Tyrion,What?
5018,Balon,Mandon,"Those are brave men,Lets go kill them."
5019,Stannis,Tyrion,"Here!Here,  Im here, help me!"
5020,Mandon,Yellow,MY LORD!
5021,Mandon,Yellow,MY LORD This is a filler string intended to act as a buffer between chapters to help prevent characters from leaking over into the previous chapter thereby really messing up the distance metrics.!
5022,Mandon,Tyrion,Jaime?
5023,Lancel,Tyrion,"Be still, my lord, youre hurt bad."
5024,Lancel,Mandon,"Tell my brother, ser."
5025,Lancel,Mandon,Your brothers likely dead.
5026,Cersei,Mandon,"He was on the  bridge of boats when it broke apart, we think."
5027,Chett,Jacelyn,  Osney Kettleblack pushed past him.
5028,Joffrey,Sansa,"Theres mobs at the Iron Gate and the Gate of the Gods fighting to get out, and  Flea Bottoms one great drunken riot."
5029,Lancel,Osfryd,Raise the drawbridge and bar the doors.No  one enters or leaves Maegors without my leave.What about them women who went to pray?They chose to leave my protection.
5030,Lancel,Osfryd,Wheres my  son?The castle gatehouse.
5031,Lancel,Osfryd,"Theres a mob howling outside, half  of them gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate.Bring him inside Maegors nowNo!"
5032,Chett,Jacelyn,"Well have the Mud Gate all over again.Let him stay where he is, hes the king-Hes my son."
5033,Cersei,Osfryd,"You claim to be a Lannister as well, cousin, prove it."
5034,Cersei,Osfryd,Now means today.
5035,Cersei,Joffrey,"Cersei,if we lose the castle, Joffrey will be killed in any case, you  know that.Let him stay, Ill keep him by me, I swear-Get out of my way."
5036,Ilyn,Sansa,"Oh, gods,Were lost, the battles lost, shes running."
5037,Ilyn,Sansa,"Dont be afraid,The queen  has raised the drawbridge."
5038,Moon,Sansa,.Whats happened?
5039,Moon,Sansa,"What did  Osney tell her?Is the king hurt, has the city fallen?Tell us,"
5040,Moon,Sansa,Joffreys come back to the castle.
5041,Moon,Sansa,The queen will be back soon.
5042,Moon,Sansa,"Moon Boy, make us laugh."
5043,Lancel,Sansa,"Madness,Gods, the Imp was right, was right ."
5044,Lancel,Sansa,".Help him,"
5045,Lancel,Sansa,Take him to Maester Frenken.
5046,Dontos,Sansa,"Go back to  your bedchamber, sweet Jonquil,Lock yourself in, youll be safer there.Ill come for you  when the battles done."
5047,Chett,Sansa,"Lady,"
5048,Sandor,Sansa,Little bird.I knew youd come.
5049,Chett,Sandor,If you scream Ill kill you.Believe that.
5050,Chett,Sandor,"Dont you want to  ask whos winning the battle, little bird?Who?"
5051,Sandor,Sansa,I only know whos lost.Me.
5052,Sandor,Sansa,What  have you lost?All.
5053,Sandor,Sansa,Bloody dwarf.
5054,Sandor,Sansa,"Years ago.Hes dead, they say.Dead?"
5055,Sandor,Sansa,I dont want him dead.
5056,Sandor,Sansa,I want him burned.
5057,Sandor,Sansa,Im going.Going?
5058,Sandor,Sansa,"The little bird repeats whatever she hears.Going, yes.Where will you go?Away from here."
5059,Sandor,Sansa,"North somewhere, anywhere.You wont get out,The queens closed up Maegors, and the city gates are shut as well.Not to me."
5060,Chett,Sansa,And I have this.
5061,Chett,Sansa,The man who  tries to stop me is a dead man.Unless hes on fire.
5062,Chett,Sansa,"Why did you come here?You promised me a song, little bird.Have you forgotten?"
5063,Chett,Sansa,"I cant,Let me go, youre scaring me.Everything scares you."
5064,Chett,Sansa,Look at me.
5065,Chett,Sansa,"I could keep you safe,Theyre all afraid of me.No one would hurt you again, or Id kill  them."
5066,Florian,Sansa,"Still cant bear to look, can  you?"
5067,Florian,Jon,"Ill have that song.Florian and Jonquil, you said."
5068,Florian,Jon,"Sing, little bird.Sing for your little life."
5069,Chett,Sansa,"Little bird,"
5070,Sansa,Stannis,What is it?
5071,Sansa,Stannis,Whats happened?Tell me! Its done!
5072,Dontos,Sansa,"It means youre safe, dont you see?Tell me whats happened!"
5073,Dontos,Stannis,They came up through the  ashes while the river was burning.
5074,Renly,Stannis,  
5075,Renly,Stannis,It was Lord Renly!
5076,Renly,Sansa,to be a knight!
5077,Daenerys,Irri,"Take it away,The docks are no place for ladys finery."
5078,Drogo,Jhiqui,"I have won no victories,"
5079,Drogo,Jhiqui,You burned the maegi in their house of dust and sent their souls to hell.
5080,Daenerys,Xaro,"Was it not you who told me warlocks were no more than old  soldiers, vainly boasting of forgotten deeds and lost prowess?"
5081,Daenerys,Xaro,"And so it was, then."
5082,Chett,Xaro,A man must  wonder.
5083,Chett,Xaro,These are strange times in Qarth.
5084,Chett,Xaro,"it grieves me  to say so, yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely, and sooner rather than later."
5085,Chett,Xaro,"You need not go alone, though."
5086,Chett,Xaro,"Give me a son, my sweet song of  joy!"
5087,Chett,Xaro,"I will not wed you, Xaro."
5088,Chett,Xaro,Then go.But where?Somewhere far from here.
5089,Daenerys,Xaro,"An army, is it?"
5090,Daenerys,Xaro,"A kettle of gold?A galley, perhaps?"
5091,Daenerys,Xaro,"A ship, yes."
5092,Daenerys,Xaro,"I am a trader, Khaleesi."
5093,Daenerys,Xaro,"You need only say that one sweet word.No,Alas,that was not the word I meant.Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children?Whyever not?"
5094,Daenerys,Xaro,Mothers sell their children every day.Not the Mother of Dragons.Not even for twenty ships?Not for a hundred.
5095,Daenerys,Xaro,I do not have a hundred.
5096,Daenerys,Xaro,You will still have two and thirty ships as well.
5097,Daenerys,Xaro,"How many ships do you own, Xaro? Eighty-three, if one does not count my pleasure barge.And your colleagues in the Thirteen?Among us all, perhaps a thousand.And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood?Their trifling fleets are of no account.Even so,tell me.Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers.No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood.And the Asshaii, the Braavosi, the Summer islanders, the Ibbenese, and all the other peoples who sail  the great salt sea, how many ships do they have?All together?Many and more,What does this matter?I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world."
5098,Daenerys,Xaro,it  seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair.
5099,Daenerys,Xaro,Did I not warn you not to  enter the Palace of Dust?
5100,Daenerys,Xaro,Pah.
5101,Daenerys,Jorah,"The dragon has three heads,Do  you know what that means, Jorah?Your Grace?The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon, red on black.I know that.But there are no three-headed dragons.The three heads were Aegon and his sisters.Visenya and Rhaenys,I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son  Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys.Blue lips speak only lies, isnt that what Xaro told you?"
5102,Daenerys,Jorah,"All they wanted was to suck the life from you, you know that now.Perhaps,Yet the things I saw    "
5103,Daenerys,Jorah,"What is a mummers dragon, pray?A cloth dragon on poles,Mummers use them in their follies, to give the heroes  something to fight."
5104,Daenerys,Jorah,"His is the song of ice and fire, my brother said."
5105,Jorah,Viserys,He had a harp with silver strings.
5106,Jorah,Viserys,"Prince Rhaegar played such a harp,You saw him?"
5107,Daenerys,Jorah,"There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast.My brother said the babe was the  prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon.Prince Aegon was Rhaegars heir by Elia of Dorne,But if he was this prince that was  promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a  wall.I remember,They murdered Rhaegars daughter as well, the little princess."
5108,Aegon,Aggo,"What  is the song of ice and fire?Its no song Ive ever heard.I went to the warlocks hoping for answers, but instead theyve left me with a hundred new questions."
5109,Aggo,Jhogo,"Make way,I smell it, Khaleesi,The poison water."
5110,Daenerys,Jorah,"Aggo, Jhogo, you will guard the horses while Ser Jorah and I speak to the  captains.As you say, Khaleesi.We will watch you as you go."
5111,Daenerys,Jorah,"You require passage for a hundred Dothraki, all their horses, yourself and this knight, and three  dragons?"
5112,Daenerys,Jorah,"Aye, and Im  Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night."
5113,Daenerys,Xaro,"Ill have no such godless  savages in my Belly, Ill not."
5114,Jorah,Mag,Your  Grace.
5115,Jorah,Mag,"No, do not turn."
5116,Daenerys,Jorah,"This is a noble work, my queen,See how  it shines in the sun?"
5117,Daenerys,Jorah,"I see a fat brown man and an older man with a staff.Which is it?Both of them,They have been following us since we left Quicksilver."
5118,Daenerys,Jorah,"A most excellent brass, great lady,Bright as the  sun!And for the Mother of Dragons, only thirty honors."
5119,Daenerys,Jorah,Where are my guards?
5120,Daenerys,Jorah,This man is trying  to rob me!
5121,Daenerys,Jorah,"They may not mean  me ill. Men have looked at women since time began, perhaps it is no more than that."
5122,Daenerys,Jorah,Thirty?
5123,Daenerys,Jorah,"The price is twenty  honors.All the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors,"
5124,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ten, Khaleesi, because you are so lovely."
5125,Chett,Daenerys,Only brass this fine could capture  such beauty.It might serve to carry nightsoil.
5126,Chett,Daenerys,But pay for it?
5127,Chett,Daenerys,"Worms have crawled up your nose and eaten your wits.Eight honors,My wives will beat me and call me fool, but I am a helpless child in your  hands.Come, eight, that is less than it is worth.What do I need with dull brass when Xaro Xhoan Daxos feeds me off plates of gold?"
5128,Aggo,Jhogo,"The old man does not wear a sword,"
5129,Aggo,Jorah,"Five honors, for five it is yours, it was meant for you.A hardwood staff can crack a skull as well as any mace.Four!I know you want it!"
5130,Daenerys,Jorah,"Do they follow?Lift that up a little higher,Yes.The old man pretends to linger at a  potters stall, but the brown one has eyes only for you.Two honors!"
5131,Daenerys,Jorah,Two!
5132,Daenerys,Jorah,"Pay him before he kills himself,"
5133,Daenerys,Jorah,"Mother of Dragons, for you."
5134,Daenerys,Jorah,You are too generous.
5135,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am so sorry,"
5136,Aggo,Jorah,"Your Grace, a thousand pardons."
5137,Aggo,Jorah,Its dead.Did I break your hand?
5138,Aggo,Jhogo,"I dont think so.I had to knock it away,"
5139,Daenerys,Jorah,"Khaleesi, we saw him strike you.Would you see the color of his blood? Release him."
5140,Daenerys,Jorah,"Look at the bottom of his staff, blood of my blood."
5141,Daenerys,Jorah,Put down your steel!Stop it!Your Grace?
5142,Daenerys,Jorah,These men attacked you.They were defending me.
5143,Daenerys,Jorah,"It was the other  one, the Qartheen."
5144,Daenerys,Jorah,He was a Sorrowful Man.
5145,Daenerys,Jhogo,This man knocked it out of my hand.
5146,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Were you stung?No, good lady,or else I would be dead."
5147,Aggo,Jhogo,"Who is it that I owe my life to?You owe me nothing, Your Grace.I am called Arstan, though Belwas named me Whitebeard on the  voyage here."
5148,Aggo,Belwas,And who is Belwas?
5149,Belwas,Daenerys,I am Belwas.
5150,Belwas,Daenerys,Never did I lose.
5151,Belwas,Daenerys,"I  let each man cut me once, before I kill him.Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas  has slain."
5152,Belwas,Daenerys,"And why are you  here, Strong Belwas?From Meereen I am sold to Qohor, and then to Pentos and the fat man with sweet stink in his hair.He  it was who send Strong Belwas back across the sea, and old Whitebeard to serve him.Illyrio?"
5153,Belwas,Daenerys,"You were sent by Magister Illyrio?We were, Your Grace,The Magister begs your kind indulgence for sending  us in his stead, but he cannot sit a horse as he did in his youth, and sea travel upsets his digestion."
5154,Daenerys,Jorah,I regret if  we caused you alarm.
5155,Daenerys,Jorah,.Regal?
5156,Daenerys,Jorah,"You speak  the Common Tongue well, Arstan.Are you of Westeros?I am."
5157,Daenerys,Jorah,As a boy I squired for a knight of Lord  Swanns household.
5158,Belwas,Jorah,"Now I  squire for Belwas.A bit old for such, arent you?"
5159,Belwas,Jorah,"Not too old to serve my liege, Lord Mormont.You know me as well?I saw you fight a time or two."
5160,Daenerys,Jorah,"You do not recall, Lord Mormont?"
5161,Daenerys,Jorah,"Your face seems familiar, but there were hundreds at Lannisport and thousands on  Pyke."
5162,Arstan,Daenerys,I am but a knight.A knight of my Queensguard.
5163,Arstan,Daenerys,And my true friend and good counselor.
5164,Belwas,Jorah,"Rise, Arstan Whitebeard."
5165,Belwas,Jhogo,"They crossed the red waste with me, and saw my dragons born.Horse boys."
5166,Aggo,Belwas,Belwas has killed many horse boys in the fighting pits.They  jingle when they die.
5167,Aggo,Belwas,"Never have I killed a fat brown man.Belwas will be the first.Sheath your steel, blood of my blood,this man comes to serve me."
5168,Arstan,Daenerys,"Now tell me, what would Magister  Illyrio have of me, that he would send you all the way from Pentos?He would have dragons,and the girl who makes them. said Arstan."
5169,Daenerys,Robert,"When we set sail from Pentos there were four kings in the land, and no justice to be had."
5170,Belwas,Daenerys,"I have three dragons,and more  than a hundred in my khalasar, with all their goods and horses.it is no matter,We take all.The fat man hires three ships for his little silverhair  queen.it is so, Your Grace,The great cog Saduleon is berthed at the end of the  quay, and the galleys Summer Sun and fosos Prank are anchored beyond the breakwater."
5171,Arstan,Daenerys,"I shall tell my people to make ready to depart at  once.But the ships that bring me home must bear different names.As you wish,What names would you prefer?Vhagar, Meraxes."
5172,Arstan,Daenerys,I want every man who sees them to know the dragons are returned.
5173,Amabel,Arya,"You did that on purpose,What do you want?"
5174,Harra,Pia,See there?
5175,Amabel,Pia,When this northman falls youll be where she is.Let me go.
5176,Amabel,Tywin,"He will fall too, Harrenhal pulls them all down in the end."
5177,Harra,Tywin,And dont think he wont know  what you did!
5178,Arya,Harra,I may have a turn at you myself.
5179,Chett,Jacelyn,
5180,Amabel,Arya,"Dont ever touch me,or Ill kill you."
5181,Amabel,Arya,"You  think youre safe with that little bloody man on your teat, but youre not!"
5182,Amabel,Arya,See  what happens when they get here.
5183,Arya,Gendry,Admiring your work?
5184,Amory,Arya,"Its Steelshanks Waltons  work,And the Mummers, and Lord Bolton.And who gave us all them?You and your weasel soup."
5185,Amory,Arya,It was just hot broth.You hated Ser Amory too.I hate this lot worse.
5186,Amory,Harren,"Septon Utt likes little boys, Qyburn  does black magic, and your friend Biter eats people."
5187,Arya,Shagwell,A riddle!
5188,Arya,Shagwell,"If  Lord Boltons goat eats the men who fed Lord Lannisters goat, how many goats are there?One,Now theres a weasel clever as a goat!"
5189,Arya,Elmar,"Nan,Put down that pail and come help me."
5190,Elmar,Roose,Do you think its clean enough?
5191,Elmar,Roose,You need to shake out the sand.
5192,Elmar,Roose,See?
5193,Elmar,Roose,Youd best do it again.You do it.
5194,Arya,Elmar,I have to bring  mlord water for his basin.
5195,Arya,Elmar,Not the regular black leeches but the  big pale ones.
5196,Arya,Qyburn,"I forgot, youre too skinny to push such a heavy barrel.I forgot, youre stupid."
5197,Arya,Qyburn,Maybe you should get leeched too.Theres leeches in  the Neck as big as pigs.
5198,Aenys,Arya,We must not allow Lord Tywin to trap us here at Harrenhal Ser Aenys Frey was saying as Arya filled  the washbasin.
5199,Aenys,Harren,"The castle is so large it requires an army to hold it, and once  surrounded we cannot feed an army."
5200,Jared,Roose,"We live on forage, and if the Lannisters deny that to us, we will be down to  rats and shoe leather in a moons turn.I do not mean to be besieged here."
5201,Arya,Jared,"What, then?"
5202,Arya,Jared,Is Edmure Tully so drunk on his victory that he thinks to give Lord Tywin battle in the  open field?
5203,Aenys,Qyburn,"Lord Tywin is many leagues from here,He has many matters yet to settle at Kings  Landing.He will not march on Harrenhal for some time."
5204,Aenys,Qyburn,"You do not know the Lannisters as we do, my lord.King  Stannis thought that Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away as well, and it undid him."
5205,Aenys,Hosteen,"I am not a man to be undone,  ser.Even if Riverrun marshals all its strength and the Young Wolf wins back from the west, how can we  hope to match the numbers Lord Tywin can send against us?"
5206,Harys,Hosteen,"Highgarden has joined itself to Joffreys cause, I  remind you!I had not forgotten.I have been Lord Tywins captive once,I have no wish to enjoy Lannister hospitality again."
5207,Harys,Hosteen,"If Lord Tywin could defeat  a seasoned man like Stannis Baratheon, what chance will our boy king have against him?"
5208,Hosteen,Roose,"Someone must have the courage to say it,The war is lost.King Robb must be  made to see that."
5209,Hosteen,Roose,"His Grace has defeated the Lannisters every time he has  faced them in battle.He has lost the north,He has lost Winterfell!"
5210,Arya,Hosteen,.
5211,Hosteen,Walder,"Had Stannis won, all might have been different,"
5212,Hosteen,Walder,"Stannis lost,Wishing it were otherwise will not make it so."
5213,Robb,Roose,"He must put off his crown and bend the knee, little as he may like it.And who will tell him so?"
5214,Robb,Roose,It is a fine thing to have so many valiant brothers in  such troubled times.I shall think on all youve said.
5215,Arya,Walton,"I am bled sufficiently.Nan, you may  remove the leeches.At once, my lord."
5216,Qyburn,Walda,There is a letter from your lady wife.
5217,Arya,Walda,"You may read it,"
5218,Arya,Walda,"I pray for  you morn, noon, and night, my sweet lord,and count the days until you share my bed again."
5219,Arya,Helman,"I will send a letter of  my own,To the Lady Walda?To Ser Helman Tallhart."
5220,Arya,Helman,"Tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch, by command of the king."
5221,Arya,Joffrey,"Let them  take their vengeance on Duskendale.I shall prepare the message for your seal, my lord."
5222,Qyburn,Roose,"I will hunt today,Is it safe, my lord?"
5223,Qyburn,Roose,"Only three days past, Septon Utts men were attacked by wolves.They came right into his camp, not five yards from the fire, and killed two horses.It is wolves I mean to hunt.I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling."
5224,Qyburn,Roose,"Its said that direwolves once roamed the north in great packs  of a hundred or more, and feared neither man nor mammoth, but that was long ago and in another land.It  is queer to see the common wolves of the south so bold.Terrible times breed terrible things, my lord."
5225,Arya,Qyburn,"Are these times so terrible,  Maester?Summer is gone and there are four kings in the realm.One king may be terrible, but four?"
5226,Arya,Qyburn,"Nan, my fur cloak."
5227,Arya,Qyburn,"My  chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return,And tend to Lady  Waldas letter.As you say, my lord."
5228,Arya,Weese,"Ser  Gregor,Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."
5229,Arya,Weese,"The Tickler,the Hound,Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei.Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey."
5230,Arya,Robb,"Valar morghulis, "
5231,Arya,Nan,"Cubs still have that soft fur,  my lord,Make you a nice warm pair of gloves."
5232,Arya,Nan,"As the Starks are wont to  remind us, winter is coming.Have it done."
5233,Hot,Nan,"Barley bread, butter, and boar.At once, my lord."
5234,Arya,Hot,"My lord wants his supper, and hot spice wine to wash it  down,and he doesnt want it cold."
5235,Arya,Hot,"I can do it,I dont need you to show me how to spice wine."
5236,Arya,Roose,"Hope thats not weasel soup,"
5237,Chett,Roose,"Light some candles,It grows gloomy in here."
5238,Harren,Vargo,"I  will have no further need of you tonight,"
5239,Harren,Vargo,"My lord,will you  take me with you when you leave Harrenhal? "
5240,Harren,Vargo,"Did I give you leave to question me, Nan?No, my lord."
5241,Harren,Vargo,"You should not have spoken, then.Should you?No.My lord."
5242,Harren,Vargo,"I will answer you, just this once."
5243,Harren,Vargo,"You will remain here, with him.But I dont-"
5244,Harren,Vargo,"I am not in the habit of being questioned by servants, Nan.Must I have your tongue  out?"
5245,Arya,Vargo,"No, my lord.Then Ill hear no more from you?No, my lord.Go, then.I shall forget this insolence."
5246,Chett,Jacelyn,Storm coming.
5247,Arya,Elmar,Whats wrong?
5248,Arya,Elmar,"My princess,Weve been dishonored, Aenys says."
5249,Arya,Elmar,"My  lord father says Ill need to marry someone else, or be a septon."
5250,Arya,Elmar,"My brothers might be dead,"
5251,Arya,Elmar,No one cares about a serving girls brothers.
5252,Arya,Elmar,I hope your princess dies 
5253,Arya,Harren,"Tell me what to  do, you gods,"
5254,Bran,Rickon,"When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives,But there is no pack,"
5255,Jon,Sansa,"Im not even me now, Im  Nan.You are Arya of Winterfell, daughter of the north."
5256,Arya,Jon,You have the wolf  blood in you.The wolf blood.
5257,Arya,Jon,Ill be as strong as Robb.I said I would.
5258,Chett,Gendry,"Please,"
5259,Gendry,Vargo,What do you want now?
5260,Gendry,Vargo,"A sword.Blackthumb keeps all the blades locked up, I told you that a hundred times.Is this for Lord Leech?For me.Break the lock with your hammer.Theyll break my hand,Or worse.Not if you run off with me.Run, and theyll catch you and kill you.Theyll do you worse.Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers, he told me so."
5261,Gendry,Vargo,So?
5262,Gendry,Vargo,"So when Vargo Hoats the lord, hes  going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away.The smiths too.Thats only a story, she lied."
5263,Arya,Hot,"No one ever comes there.I know that gate.Its guarded, same as the rest.So?You wont forget the swords?I never said Id come.No.But if you do, you wont forget the swords?"
5264,Arya,Hot,"No,I guess I wont."
5265,Chett,Jacelyn,Eh?
5266,Arya,Gendry,"Wha, at this hour?Horses, you say?"
5267,Arya,Gendry,"Whas he want horses for, in the dark?Lord Bolton is not in the habit of being questioned by servants."
5268,Arya,Gendry,"Three, you say?One two three."
5269,Arya,Gendry,Fast and surefoot.
5270,Harren,Syrio,"I could  catch you if I wanted,but I have to go, cat."
5271,Gendry,Harren,Here I am.
5272,Gendry,Harren,Be quiet or theyll hear  you.
5273,Arya,Gendry,"Theres a guard on that postern,I told you there would  be.You stay here with the horses,Ill get rid of him.Come quick when I call."
5274,Arya,Hot,"Hoot like an owl when you want us to come.Im not an owl,Im a wolf.Ill howl."
5275,Arya,Roose,Lord  Bolton sent me.At this hour?Why for?
5276,Arya,Jaqen,"He told me to give all his guards a silver piece, for their good service."
5277,Arya,Jaqen,"Silver, you say?"
5278,Arya,Jaqen,"Give it over,  then."
5279,Arya,Harren,"Valar morghulis, "
5280,Gendry,Hot,You killed him!
5281,Gendry,Hot,What did you think I would do?
5282,Joffrey,Tywin,until Your Grace does come of age.
5283,Joffrey,Sansa,"The roses support the lion, as the might of Highgarden supports the  realm,If there is any boon you would ask of me, ask and it shall be yours."
5284,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your Grace,I beg the honor of serving in your Kingsguard, to defend you against  your enemies."
5285,Joffrey,Sansa,"Done, brother."
5286,Garlan,Joffrey,"There is no greater pleasure than to serve the Kings Grace.If I was  deemed worthy to join your royal council, you would find none more loyal or true."
5287,Garlan,Loras,Your wish is granted.
5288,Loras,Margaery,"Your Grace,"
5289,Cersei,Joffrey,"I beseech you to send for her, to  take her hand in marriage, and to wed your House to mine for all time."
5290,Cersei,Joffrey,"Ser Garlan, your sisters beauty is famed throughout the  Seven Kingdoms, but I am promised to another.A king must keep his word."
5291,Cersei,Sansa,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it  would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl  whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now."
5292,Cersei,Sansa,The Lady Margaery will make you a far more suitable  queen.
5293,Joffrey,Sansa,"Margaery,Give us Margaery!"
5294,Joffrey,Sansa,Tyrell!
5295,Joffrey,Sansa,"I would like to heed the wishes of my people, Mother, but I took a holy vow."
5296,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your Grace, the gods hold bethrothal solemn, but your father, King  Robert of blessed memory, made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had revealed their falseness."
5297,Joffrey,Sansa,"So far as the Faith  is concerned, there is no valid marriage contract twixt you and Sansa Stark.Margaery, Margaery"
5298,Garlan,Joffrey,The gods are good.
5299,Garlan,Sansa,"I will wed your sweet sister, and  gladly, ser."
5300,Cersei,Sansa,"I will not have my son humiliated,Do you hear me?Yes.But if Im not to be queen, what will become of me?That will need to be determined.For the moment, you shall remain here at court, as our ward.I want to go home."
5301,Joffrey,Sansa,"You should have learned by now, none of us get the things we want."
5302,Kevan,Tywin,It is His Graces wish that these good men be rewarded for their valor.
5303,Aemon,Sansa,"To all this, the Kings Hand and the small council consent."
5304,Joffrey,Lancel,"leaving no trueborn  heirs of lawful Darry blood, but only a bastard cousin."
5305,Lancel,Sansa,"Lord Petyr Baelish,"
5306,Harren,Kevan,It is the wish of the Kings Grace that his loyal councillor Petyr Baelish  be rewarded for faithful service to crown and realm.
5307,Joffrey,Petyr,The Kings    Hand and the small council consent.
5308,Joffrey,Petyr,"I thank you humbly, Your Grace.I suppose  this means Ill need to see about getting some sons and grandsons."
5309,Ilyn,Joffrey,"Do not imagine this is done, boy,The Lord of Light protects King Stannis, now and always.All your  swords and all your scheming shall not save you when his hour comes.Your hour is come right now."
5310,Chett,Jacelyn,Stannis is the true king!
5311,Kevan,Stannis,Joffrey is the black worm eating the heart of the realm!
5312,Joffrey,Kevan,Save yourselves!
5313,Joffrey,Kevan,The scouring fire will come!King  Stannis will return! 
5314,Joffrey,Kevan,Im king!
5315,Joffrey,Kevan,I command it.
5316,Cersei,Tywin,Mother!
5317,Cersei,Tywin,The throne denies him!
5318,Cersei,Tywin,He is no king!
5319,Joffrey,Meryn,No king!
5320,Sansa,Tywin,"We continue,Those who wish to ask pardon for  their treasons may do so.We will have no more follies."
5321,Dontos,Sansa,Why so sadface?
5322,Joffrey,Sansa,"You were there, you  heard."
5323,Joffrey,Sansa,. 
5324,Joffrey,Sansa,"Oh, Jonquil, my poor Jonquil, you do not understand."
5325,Joffrey,Sansa,Theyve    scarcely begun.
5326,Joffrey,Sansa,"What do you mean?The queen will never let you go, never."
5327,Joffrey,Sansa,"If he wants you in his bed, he will have you, only now it will be bastards he plants in your womb  instead of trueborn sons.No,He let me go, he  Ser Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on her ear.Be brave."
5328,Joffrey,Sansa,The  day has been chosen.When?
5329,Joffrey,Sansa,When will we go?The night of Joffreys wedding.
5330,Dontos,Joffrey,"For a little while, you will be forgotten, and the confusion will be our friend.The wedding wont be for a moons turn yet.Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden, theyve only now sent  for her.Youve waited so long, be patient awhile longer.Here, I have something for you."
5331,Sansa,Small,"What stones are these?Black amethysts from Asshai.The rarest kind, a deep true purple by daylight.Its very lovely,Lovelier than you know, sweet child."
5332,Dontos,Sansa,Its vengeance for your  father.
5333,Dontos,Sansa,Its home.
5334,Luwin,Theon,"My lord prince,you must yield."
5335,Eddard,Theon,"There has been  no reply from my uncle?None,Nor from your father on Pyke.Send more birds.It will not serve.  "
5336,Eddard,Luwin,Or do you want me dead?
5337,Eddard,Luwin,The truth  now.
5338,Luwin,Theon,"My order serves.Yes, but whom?The realm,"
5339,Theon,Wex,So now I counsel you to yield.
5340,Theon,Wex,"You have no hope of holding here,If your lord father meant to send you aid, he  would have done so by now."
5341,Theon,Wex,"The battle for the north will be fought  amidst the ruins of Moat Cailin.That may be so,And so long as I hold Winterfell, Ser Rodrik and Starks lords  bannermen cannot march south to take my uncle in the rear."
5342,Theon,Wex,"I have food enough to stand a years siege, if need be.There will be no siege."
5343,Lorren,Theon,"I know what kind of mercy they have for me.There is a way.I am ironborn,I have my own way."
5344,Lorren,Wex,"Ill have my mail scoured clean, and my garrison assembled in the  yard."
5345,Luwin,Wex,As you  command.
5346,Luwin,Wex,"The northmen will be on us  before nightfall,Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call."
5347,Luwin,Urzen,"If you leave now, before Ser Rodriks main force is upon us, theres  still a chance you may win free."
5348,Theon,Urzen,"Those who  would stay and fight, step forward."
5349,Lorren,Werlag,Who else?
5350,Stygg,Theon,"Go, then,Run to my sister.Shell give you all a warm  welcome, I have no doubt."
5351,Lorren,Theon,"Back to the walls.If the gods should spare us, I shall remember every man of  you."
5352,Lorren,Theon,"The castle folk will turn on us soon as the fight begins.I know that.What would you have me do?Put them out,Every one."
5353,Lorren,Theon,Is the noose ready?It is.You mean to use it?Do you know a better way?Aye.
5354,Lorren,Theon,None will pass the moat while I still draw breath.
5355,Lorren,Wex,"Well use the  noose.As you say,"
5356,Lorren,Theon,"I shall be out shortly,Alone."
5357,Lorren,Theon,"Only blood can wash out blood,Knights may keep their  truces with other knights, but they are not so careful of their honor when dealing with those they deem  outlaw."
5358,Lorren,Theon,I am the Prince of Winterfell and heir to the Iron Islands.Now go find the girl and do as  I told you.
5359,Lorren,Theon,"Aye, Prince."
5360,Cley,Theon,Ser Rodrik.
5361,Cley,Theon,It grieves me that we must meet as foes.My own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you.
5362,Robb,Theon,"Theon Turncloak.I am a Greyjoy of Pyke,The cloak my father swaddled me in bore a kraken,    not a direwolf.For ten years you have been a ward of Stark.Hostage and prisoner, I call it.Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a  dungeon wall."
5363,Robb,Theon,"Would that I had thrust a sword through your belly instead  of placing one in your hand.I came out to parley, not to suffer your insults."
5364,Robb,Theon,"What would you  have of me?Two things,Winterfell, and your life."
5365,Robb,Theon,"May the gods take pity on you when he returns.Robb will never look on Winterfell again,He will break himself on Moat Cailin, as  every southron army has done for ten thousand years.We hold the north now, ser.You hold three castles,and this one I mean to take back, Turncloak."
5366,Balon,Theon,Here are my terms.
5367,Balon,Rodrik,Those who defy us will be destroyed.
5368,Rodrik,Theon,"Are you mad, Greyjoy?"
5369,Rodrik,Theon,"Only vain, lad.Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of himself, I  fear."
5370,Rodrik,Theon,Do not imagine that I need wait for Robb to fight his way up  the Neck to deal with the likes of you.
5371,Rodrik,Theon,"and if the tales be true,  you have no more than fifty."
5372,Lorren,Theon,I have something better than men.
5373,Rodrik,Theon,"This is craven,To use a child so ."
5374,Rodrik,Theon,"this is despicable.Oh, I know,Its a dish I tasted myself, or have you forgotten?I was ten when I was  taken from my fathers house, to make certain he would raise no more rebellions.It is not the same!"
5375,Rodrik,Theon,"The noose I wore was not made of hempen rope, thats true enough, but I  felt it all the same."
5376,Rodrik,Theon,It chafed me raw.
5377,Rodrik,Theon,"No harm was ever done you.And no harm will be done your Beth, so long as you-Viper,I gave you the chance to save your men and die with some small shred of  honor, Turncloak.I should have known that was too much to ask of a childkiller."
5378,Rodrik,Theon,"I ought cut you down here and now and put an end to your lies and deceits.By the  gods, I should."
5379,Rodrik,Theon,"Forswear your oath and murder me, and you will watch your little Beth strangle at the end of a rope."
5380,Rodrik,Theon,"Truly, I  have lived too long.I will not disagree, ser.Will you accept my terms?I have a duty to Lady Catelyn and House Stark.And your own House?Beth is the last of your blood."
5381,Rodrik,Theon,I offer myself in my daughters place.
5382,Rodrik,Theon,Surely the castellan of Winterfell is worth more than a child.Not to me.
5383,Rodrik,Theon,"Not to Lord Manderly or  Leobald Tallhart either, Id wager."
5384,Rodrik,Theon,"No, Ill keep the girl ."
5385,Rodrik,Theon,"Her life is in your  hands.Gods be good, Theon, how can you do this?"
5386,Beth,Theon,". If this host is still in arms before my gate when the sun sets, Beth will hang,Another  hostage will follow her to the grave at first light, and another at sunset."
5387,Beth,Theon,I have no lack of hostages.
5388,Lorren,Wex,"It may stay them,Well  know by sunset.Take the girl in till then, and keep her somewhere safe."
5389,Eddard,Theon,I need a cup of wine.A vat of wine would do even better.
5390,Theon,Wex,"I rode  beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood,"
5391,Luwin,Theon,"If you had a hundred archers as good as yourself, you might have a chance to hold the castle,"
5392,Luwin,Theon,"Go away,I have had enough of  your counsel.And life?Have you had enough of that, my lord prince?"
5393,Luwin,Theon,One more word and Ill put this shaft through your heart.You wont.
5394,Luwin,Theon,"Care to make a wager?I am your last hope, Theon."
5395,Eddard,Theon,I will not run.I do not speak of running.Take the black.The Nights Watch?
5396,Eddard,Theon,"Ser Rodrik has served House Stark all his life, and House Stark has always been a friend to the Watch."
5397,Eddard,Theon,"Open your gates, lay down your arms, accept his terms, and he must let you take  the black."
5398,Asha,Luwin,PRINCE This is a filler string intended to act as a buffer between chapters to help prevent characters from leaking over into the previous chapter thereby really messing up the distance metrics.!
5399,Luwin,Reek,The northmen-Is it the attack?
5400,Luwin,Reek,Theres still time.   Kromm said urgently.
5401,Reek,Theon,No.

5403,Luwin,Theon,"Ill see this for myself,"
5404,Luwin,Theon,"The Dothraki believe the stars are spirits of the  valiant dead,"
5405,Lorren,Luwin,Dothraki?The horselords across the narrow sea.Oh.Them.
5406,Lorren,Luwin,Savages believe all manner of foolish things.
5407,Lorren,Rodrik,Are you friend or foe?
5408,Lorren,Rodrik,Would a foe bring such fine gifts?
5409,Lorren,Rodrik,"The old castellan,With Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn."
5410,Luwin,Theon,"The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor, or we would have brought him as well,"
5411,Luwin,Theon,Open the gates for our friends.
5412,Luwin,Theon,How many men did you lose?
5413,Luwin,Theon,Twenty or thirty.
5414,Luwin,Theon,"Ser Rodrik had you five-to-one.Aye, but he thought us friends."
5415,Chett,Theon,Then I let him see my face.
5416,Chett,Theon,"Reek,"
5417,Chett,Theon,The wretch is dead.
5418,Chett,Theon,The girls fault.
5419,Palla,Theon,"They might have hanged me anyway, but it was the only chance  I saw."
5420,Palla,Theon,"And now, my sweet prince, there was a  woman promised me, if I brought two hundred men.Well, I brought three times as many, and no green  boys nor fieldhands neither, but my fathers own garrison."
5421,Palla,Theon,"Harrag,"
5422,Palla,Theon,?Ramsay.
5423,Palla,Theon,"Snow, my wife called  me before she ate her fingers, but I  say Bolton."
5424,Palla,Theon,"So youd offer me a kennel girl for my good service, is that the way of  it?"
5425,Palla,Theon,She was what was promised.She smells of dogshit.
5426,Palla,Theon,Kyra?Are you mad?
5427,Palla,Theon,Ill have you-
5428,Luwin,Theon,"Save me the Freys,and bum the rest."
5429,Chett,Tyrion,"My lord, you must be still,You are grievous hurt."
