0,Alleras,Mollander,"Dragons,"
1,Alleras,Roone,"Throw the apple,"
2,Pate,Roone,I should like to see a dragon.
3,Chett,Pate,I should like that very much.
4,Armen,Roone,"You were born too late for dragons, lad,"
5,Alleras,Mollander,"The last one perished during the reign of King Aegon the Third.The last dragon in Westeros,Throw the apple,"
6,Alleras,Armen,"The last dragon in Westeros was the last dragon,That is well known.The apple,Unless you mean to eat it.Here."
7,Mollander,Pate,You cored it.Sweet.
8,Leo,Pate,"Too true,Youll be a former novice, herding swine."
9,Alleras,Pate,"Pate, Pate, Pate,"
10,Alleras,Pate,Who are you?An alchemist.
11,Mollander,Pate,"I am no thief,I  am a novice of the Citadel.If you should  reconsider, I shall return here three days hence, with my dragon."
12,Mollander,Pate,"Oldtown is not the world,"
13,Balon,Mollander,"My father always said the world was bigger than any lords castle,Dragons must be the least of the things a man might find in Qarth and Asshai and Yi Ti.   Armen interrupted."
14,Armen,Mollander,Youd need to be down the belly yourself to swear they werent.   insisted Armen.
15,Mollander,Pate,"All speak of dragons, and a beautiful young queen."
16,Mollander,Pate,"Theres another apple near your foot,and I still have two  arrows in my quiver.Fuck your quiver."
17,Mollander,Pate,"This ones wormy,"
18,Alleras,Armen,"If you cut a worm in two, you make two worms,If only it worked that way with apples, no one would ever need go hungry,"
19,Alleras,Mollander,"One last apple,and I will tell you what I suspect about these dragons.What could you know that I dont?"
20,Alleras,Roone,"You always miss your last shot,"
21,Alleras,Roone,See?
22,Alleras,Roone,The day you make them all is the day you stop improving.
23,Alleras,Roone,"The dragon has three heads,Is this a riddle?"
24,Alleras,Roone,Sphinxes always speak in riddles in the tales.No riddle.
25,Alleras,Leo,the Sphinx.
26,Alleras,Armen,"No dragon has ever had three heads except on shields and banners,That was a heraldic charge, no more.Furthermore, the Targaryens are all dead.Not all,The Beggar King had a sister.I thought her head was smashed against a wall,No,It was Prince Rhaegars young son Aegon whose head was dashed against  the wall by the Lion of Lannisters brave men."
27,Alleras,Mollander,The one they called Daenerys.The Stormborn.I recall her now.
28,Armen,Mollander,Heres to her!
29,Armen,Pate,"Wheres Rosey?Our rightful queen deserves another round of  cider, wouldnt you say?"
30,Armen,Pate,"Lower your voice, fool."
31,Leo,Pate,"The Spider has ears everywhere.Ah, dont piss your breeches, Armen.I was proposing a drink, not a rebellion."
32,Leo,Pate,"I always knew you were a  traitor, Hopfrog."
33,Alleras,Mollander,Bugger that.
34,Alleras,Mollander,You are not welcome here.
35,Alleras,Armen,Leo.
36,Armen,Leo,  
37,Armen,Leo,Perestan says the world is forty thousand years old.
38,Armen,Leo,"What are three days, I ask you?"
39,Leo,Mollander,"Buy me a cup of Arbor gold, Hopfrog, and  perhaps I wont inform my father of your toast."
40,Leo,Mollander,"What did you lads have?Mutton,"
41,Alleras,Leo,We shared a haunch of  boiled mutton.Im certain it was filling.
42,Alleras,Leo,"A lords son should be open-handed,  Sphinx."
43,Alleras,Leo,Ill drink to that.
44,Alleras,Leo,I only buy for friends.
45,Alleras,Leo,My mother was a trader.
46,Alleras,Leo,Your mother was a monkey from the  Summer Isles.
47,Pate,Spotted,Unlike our spotted pig boy.
48,Alleras,Leo,You will apologize.Will I?
49,Alleras,Leo,"How can I, with my throat so dry...You shame your House with every word you say,You shame the Citadel  by being one of us.I know.So buy me some wine, that I might drown my shame.I would tear your tongue out by the roots.Truly?Then how would I tell you about the dragons?"
50,Leo,Roone,"The mongrel has  the right of it.The Mad Kings daughter is alive, and shes hatched herself three dragons.Three?"
51,Leo,Mollander,"More than two and less than four.I would not try for my golden link just  yet if I were you.You leave him be,Such a chivalrous Hopfrog."
52,Armen,Roone,The Mage is inclined to believe them.
53,Leo,Roone,"Marwyn is unsound.Archmaester Perestan would be the  first to tell you that.Archmaester Ryam says so too,"
54,Leo,Roone,"The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie hates the mastiff."
55,Marwyn,Pate,Marwyn the Mage.
56,Armen,Pate,"Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths  a man can trust in,"
57,Leo,Mollander,"Archmaester Marwyn believes in many curious things,but he has no more  proof of dragons than Mollander. said Leo."
58,Armen,Roone,What are these glass candles?
59,Armen,Roone,"The night before an acolyte says his vows, he must stand  a vigil in the vault."
60,Armen,Pate,"Wiser men simply go to  sleep, or spend their night in prayer, but every year there are always a few who must try.Yes."
61,Leo,Pate,"But whats the use of a candle that casts no light?It is a lesson,"
62,Armen,Leo,"Even after he has said his vow and donned his chain and gone forth to serve, a maester will  think back on the darkness of his vigil and remember how nothing that he did could make the  candle burn... for even with knowledge, some things are not possible."
63,Armen,Leo,"Not possible for you, you mean.I saw the candle burning with  my own eyes.You saw some candle burning, I dont doubt,A candle of black wax, perhaps.I know what I saw."
64,Armen,Pate,"It cast strange shadows and the flame never flickered, not even when a draft blew  through the open door behind me."
65,Armen,Pate,"Obsidian does not burn.Dragonglass,The smallfolk call it dragonglass."
66,Leo,Pate,"They do,and if there are dragons in the world again...Dragons and darker things,The grey sheep have closed their eyes, but the mastiff  sees the truth."
67,Armen,Leo,"An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon  us, an age for gods and heroes."
68,Armen,Leo,"Thats worth a round, Id  say.Weve drunk enough,Morn will be upon us sooner than wed like, and  Archmaester Ebrose will be speaking on the properties of urine.Those who mean to forge a  silver link would do well not to miss his talk.Far be it from me to keep you from the piss tasting,Myself, I prefer the taste of  Arbor gold.If the choice is piss or you, Ill drink piss."
69,Leo,Mollander,"Come,  Roone."
70,Alleras,Leo,Its bed for me as well.I expect Ill dream of dragons  and glass candles.All of you?
71,Alleras,Leo,"Well, Rosey will remain.Perhaps Ill wake our little sweetmeat  and make a woman of her."
72,Mollander,Pate,"If he does not have a copper for a cup of wine, he cannot  have a dragon for the girl.Aye,Besides, it takes a man to make a woman."
73,Mollander,Pate,Hell be needing you to help him to the privy.
74,Cressen,Pate,"Not just yet,Im going to stay awhile."
75,Alleras,Armen,"As you wish,"
76,Leo,Pate,"Careful,the night is damp, and the cobbles will be  slippery."
77,Leo,Pate,"How sad.The Sphinx  has stolen off with all his silver, abandoning me to Spotted Pate the pig boy."
78,Leo,Pate,"How is our lovely little Rosey, pray?Shes sleeping,Naked, I dont doubt."
79,Leo,Pate,Do you think shes truly worth a dragon?One day I  suppose I must find out.
80,Leo,Pate,"I expect that once Ive broken in the wench, her price will fall to where  even pig boys will be able to afford her.You ought to thank me."
81,Leo,Pate,Protector of the Citadel
82,Leo,Pate,"Leave Rosey be,Just leave her be, or I may kill you."
83,Leo,Pate,I do not fight duels with pig boys.Go away.
84,Chett,Pate,"Good morrow,  Pate."
85,Chett,Pate,The third day... you said you would be at the Quill and Tankard.You were with your friends.It was not my wish to intrude upon your fellowship.
86,Chett,Pate,Have you decided what you are?
87,Chett,Pate,I suppose I am a thief.I thought you might be.
88,Chett,Pate,"Pate,Pate, Pate, Pate.Do you have my dragon?"
89,Chett,Pate,If you have what I require.Give it here.I want to see.
90,Chett,Pate,The river road is not the place.Come.
91,Chett,Pate,"This is far enough,Theres no one  about.Well do it here.As you wish.I want my dragon.To be sure."
92,Chett,Pate,The key?
93,Chett,Pate,Is it some book you want?
94,Chett,Pate,What I want is none of your concern.No.
95,Chett,Pate,Show me your face.As you wish.
96,Chett,Pate,I  do not know you.Nor I you.Who are you?A stranger.
97,Chett,Pate,Truly.Oh.
98,Chett,Pate,"Were done, then."
99,Chett,Pate,Whats happening?
100,Chett,Pate,"I dont understand.And never will,"
101,Aeron,Emmon,"Have  courage,We came from the sea, and to the sea we must return."
102,Aeron,Emmon,It does  no good to fight.
103,Aeron,Emmon,"Lord God who drowned  for us,let Emmond your servant be reborn from  the sea, as you were."
104,Aeron,Emmon,"Rise,You have drowned and been returned to us.What is dead  can never die.But rises."
105,Aeron,Emmon,Rises again.
106,Aeron,Emmon,Rises again.
107,Aeron,Emmon,"Harder.And stronger.You belong to the god now,"
108,Aeron,Emmon,"You belong to the sea now, so the sea has armed you,We pray that you  shall wield your cudgel fiercely, against all the enemies of our god."
109,Aeron,Small,"Have you come to  be drowned, my lords?"
110,Aeron,Small,"I was drowned as a boy,and my son upon his name day."
111,Aeron,Small,"That is no true drowning,He  that does not die in truth cannot hope to rise from death.Why have you come, if not to prove  your faith?Lord Gorolds son came seeking you, with news."
112,Aeron,Small,"Aye, and which are you?"
113,Aeron,Small,"Gormond.Gormond Goodbrother, if it please my lord.It is the Drowned God we must please.Have you been drowned, Gormond Goodbrother?On my name day, Damphair."
114,Aeron,Small,He needs to  see you.Here I stand.Let Lord Gorold come and feast his eyes.
115,Aeron,Small,"I am to bring you to the keep,"
116,Aeron,Chett,I have the gods work to do.
117,Aeron,Balon,"Gorolds had a bird,A maesters bird, from Pyke,"
118,Aeron,Balon,"The ravens fly oer salt and stone.If there are tidings that concern  me, speak them now.Such tidings as we bear are for your ears alone, Damphair,These are not  matters I would speak of here before these others.These others are my drowned men, gods servants, just as I am.I have no secrets from them,  nor from our god, beside whose holy sea I stand."
119,Aeron,Balon,"Tell him,The king is dead,"
120,Aeron,Balon,Tell me the manner of my brothers death.His Grace was crossing a bridge at Pyke when he fell and was dashed upon the rocks below.
121,Aeron,Chett,Was the storm raging when he  fell?
122,Aeron,Chett,"Aye,it was.The Storm God cast him down,"
123,Aeron,Chett,"My brother Balon made us great  again, which earned the Storm Gods wrath."
124,Aeron,Chett,It shall be for us who remain behind in this dry and  dismal vale to finish his great work.
125,Aeron,Chett,"I shall speak  with your lord father.How far from here to Hammerhorn?Six leagues.You may ride pillion with me.One can ride faster than two.Give me your horse, and the Drowned God will bless you.Take my horse, Damphair,No."
126,Aeron,Chett,"Your horse, boy."
127,Aeron,Chett,"Meet with me at Pebbleton beneath Lord  Merlyns tower,"
128,Aeron,Chett,Which one  are you?
129,Aeron,Chett,Gran.My father awaits you within.
130,Aeron,Chett,Where is Gormond?
131,Aeron,Chett,He returns afoot.
132,Aeron,Chett,And the maester as well.
133,Aeron,Chett,"Gysella, Gwin, leave us,You as well, Gran.Maester Murenmure  will stay.He will go,This is my hall, Damphair."
134,Aeron,Balon,The maester  stays.
135,Aeron,Balon,"Then I shall go,"
136,Aeron,Balon,Euron Crows Eye  sits the Seastone Chair.
137,Aeron,Balon,"Tell  me,He sailed into Lordsport the day after the kings death, and claimed the castle and the crown as  Balons eldest brother,Now he sends forth ravens, summoning the  captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke, to bend their knees and do him homage as their  king.No."
138,Aeron,Balon,"Only a godly man may sit the Seastone  Chair.The Crows Eye worships naught but his own pride.You were on Pyke not long ago, and saw the king,Did Balon say aught to  you of the succession?"
139,Aeron,Balon,"The wolves have made a weakling of him, as I feared,I pray god that they killed him, so he cannot stand in Ashas way."
140,Aeron,Balon,"No woman will ever rule the  ironborn, not even a woman such as Asha,"
141,Aeron,Balon,"By rights the Seastone Chair belongs to Theon, or Asha if the prince is dead.That is the  law.Green land law,What is that to us?"
142,Aeron,Balon,"No woman may rule over us, nor any godless man.And Victarion?"
143,Aeron,Balon,"He has the Iron Fleet.Will Victarion make a  claim, Damphair?Euron is the elder brother..."
144,Aeron,Euron,"Euron is elder,but  Victarion is more godly.Will it come to war between them?"
145,Aeron,Euron,"Ironborn must not spill the blood of ironborn.A pious sentiment, Damphair,but not one that your brother shares."
146,Aeron,Euron,"I must send word to Pyke, and soon,Damphair, I would have your counsel.What shall it be, homage or defiance?"
147,Aeron,Euron,"For now, send only silence,I must pray on this.Pray all you wish,It does not change the law.Theon is the rightful heir,  and Asha next.Silence!"
148,Aeron,Euron,Too long have the ironborn listened to you chain-neck maesters  prating of the green lands and their laws.
149,Aeron,Euron,It is time we  listened to the voice of god.
150,Aeron,Euron,Comforts I shall know in the  Drowned Gods watery halls beneath the waves.
151,Aeron,Chett,All that I require is a fresh horse to carry me to Pebbleton.
152,Aeron,Chett,"Urri,"
153,Asha,Euron,Will it come to war?
154,Asha,Euron,A war  of brother against brother?If the Drowned God wills it.No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair.
155,Aeron,Balon,"We were born from  the sea, and to the sea we all return,"
156,Aeron,Balon,"The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast  him down, and now he feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned Gods watery halls."
157,Aeron,Balon,Balon is dead!
158,Aeron,Chett,A king will rise!
159,Aeron,Chett,"The king is dead,Aye."
160,Aeron,Chett,"And now another.LordOne raven  summons me to Pyke, another to Ten Towers."
161,Aeron,Chett,Where should I send my longships?
162,Aeron,Chett,"Ten Towers, do you say?What kraken calls you there?"
163,Aeron,Chett,The Princess Asha.
164,Aeron,Chett,"He says that Balon meant for her to sit the Seastone Chair.The Drowned God shall decide who sits the Seastone Chair,Kneel, that I  might bless you."
165,Aeron,Chett,"Lord God who drowned for us, let Meldred your servant be  born again from the sea.Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel."
166,Aeron,Chett,"What is dead may never  die,but rises again, harder and stronger.Stay and listen, that you may spread gods word."
167,Aeron,Chett,"We were born from the sea, and to the sea we all return,The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down, and now  he feasts beneath the waves."
168,Aeron,Chett,The iron king is dead!
169,Aeron,Chett,"For what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger!A king shall rise!"
170,Aeron,Euron,He shall.
171,Aeron,Euron,But who?
172,Aeron,Euron,Who shall be our king?
173,Aeron,Euron,Damphair!
174,Aeron,Euron,Damphair King!
175,Aeron,Euron,Give us Damphair!
176,Aeron,Euron,"If a father has two sons and gives to one an axe and to the other a net,  which does he intend should be the warrior?The axe is for the warrior,the net for a fisher of the seas.Aye,The god took me deep beneath the waves and drowned the worthless thing  I was."
177,Euron,Victarion,"For I have heard the god, who  says, No godless man may sit my Seastone Chair!"
178,Aeron,Victarion,"Is it Asha, then?"
179,Aeron,Victarion,"Tell us, priest!The Drowned God will tell you, but not here."
180,Aeron,Victarion,"Look not to me, nor to the laws of men, but to the sea."
181,Aeron,Harra,"Leave your halls and hovels, your castles and your keeps, and return  to Naggas hill to make a kingsmoot!"
182,Aeron,Harra,A kingsmoot?  
183,Aeron,Harra,"Yet in the dawn of days the ironborn chose their  own kings, raising up the worthiest amongst them."
184,Balon,Harra,"Seek the hill of Nagga and the bones of the Grey Kings  Hall, for in that holy place when the moon has drowned and come again we shall make ourselves  a worthy king, a godly king."
185,Balon,Harra,Listen!
186,Aeron,Balon,"He is speaking to us, and he says, We shall have no king but from the  kingsmoot!"
187,Aeron,Balon,A  kingsmoot!
188,Aeron,Balon,"A kingsmoot, a kingsmoot.No king but from the kingsmoot!"
189,Asha,Victarion,
190,Areo,Hot,"My  lady, no farther."
191,Hot,Obara,The prince  does not wish to be disturbed.
192,Hot,Obara,"You are in my way, Hotah."
193,Caleotte,Obara,"Lady Obara, I tried to tell you...Does he know that my father is dead?"
194,Caleotte,Obara,"He does,He had a bird."
195,Hot,Obara,"Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so  they may help Ellaria bring my father home."
196,Areo,Doran,What will his brother  do to avenge our murdered prince?
197,Areo,Hot,"And you say, he does not  wish to be disturbed!He does not wish to be disturbed,"
198,Aeron,Moon,"The  prince is watching the children at their play. said Obara Sand,    came the command, from behind."
199,Doran,Hot,"It  was not so long ago that you were one of the children in those pools, Obara,"
200,Doran,Hot,"It has been twenty years, or near enough to make no matter."
201,Doran,Hot,"I am the whores whelp, or had you forgotten?"
202,Doran,Hot,"My father has been murdered.He was slain in single combat during a trial by battle,By law, that is no  murder.He was your brother.He was.What do you mean to do about his death?"
203,Arianne,Obara,I have written to Lord Tywin...Written?If you were half the man my father was...I am not your father.That I knew.
204,Arianne,Obara,You would have me go to war.I know better.
205,Obara,Tywin,"Let her ride the kingsroad, whilst I turn the marcher lords out of their castles and hook  round to march on Oldtown.And how could you hope to hold Oldtown?It will be enough to sack it.  "
206,Obara,Tywin,"Obara, look at the children, if it please you.It does not please me."
207,Obara,Tywin,"Ill make him sing The Rains of Castamere as I pull his bowels out and look for gold.Look,I command you."
208,Chett,Obara,"Your father played that same game once, as I did before him,We had ten  years between us, so I had left the pools by the time he was old enough to play, but I would  watch him when I came to visit Mother."
209,Chett,Obara,"He swore that he would do it one more time, else I would never have let him  go.Let him go?"
210,Chett,Obara,As if you could have stopped him.The Red Viper of Dorne  went where he would.He did.  
211,Chett,Obara,"The day my father came to  claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go."
212,Caleotte,Obara,They say that she was weeping as she died.
213,Caleotte,Obara,"Let me use the spear; I ask no more.It is a deal to ask, Obara.I shall sleep on it.You have slept too long already.You may be right.I will send word to you at Sunspear.So long as the word is war."
214,Caleotte,Obara,My prince?
215,Caleotte,Obara,Do your legs  hurt?
216,Caleotte,Obara,Is the sun hot?Shall I fetch a draught for the pain?No.I need my wits about me.
217,Caleotte,Obara,"My prince, is it... is it prudent to allow Lady Obara to return to  Sunspear?"
218,Caleotte,Obara,They loved your brother well.So did we all.
219,Caleotte,Doran,No.
220,Caleotte,Doran,I must return to  Sunspear as well.
221,Caleotte,Doran,"Is that wise?Not wise, but necessary."
222,Caleotte,Doran,Inform my daughter Arianne that I will be there on the morrow.
223,Caleotte,Doran,"You will be seen,"
224,Areo,Caleotte,I must be seen.
225,Areo,Caleotte,Dorne must be reminded that it still has  a prince.
226,Areo,Caleotte,"Old and gouty though he is.If you return to Sunspear, you will need to give audience to Princess Myrcella,Her white knight will be with her... and you know he sends letters to his queen.I suppose he does."
227,Caleotte,Hot,"The afternoon is almost done,We will wait for morn.See that my  litter is ready by first light.As you command."
228,Caleotte,Hot,Captain?
229,Hot,Small,"Did you have brothers,  captain?"
230,Hot,Small,"Back in Norvos, when you were young?Sisters?Both,Two brothers, three sisters.I was the youngest."
231,Mors,Olyvar,"I was the oldest,"
232,Areo,Hot,"Yet here I sit, and they are gone."
233,Areo,Doran,"Enough,"
234,Areo,Doran,Let me watch the children for  a few more hours.
235,Doran,Obara,"Well met, Uncle,May I ride with  you to Sunspear?"
236,Doran,Tywin,"I would be glad of it,Gout and grief make poor companions on the road."
237,Doran,Tywin,"The gout I cannot help,"
238,Daemon,Tywin,"Is it true that Gregor Clegane admitted slaying Elia and her children?He roared out his guilt for all the court to hear,Lord Tywin has  promised us his head.And a Lannister always pays his debts,"
239,Daemon,Tywin,"If so, Ser Gregor is as good as dead,  and no thanks to Tywin Lannister."
240,Daemon,Obara,It may be so.May be?I say tis.Obara would have me go to war.
241,Daemon,Obara,"Yes, she wants to set the torch to Oldtown.She hates that city as much as our  little sister loves it.And you?"
242,Obara,Tyene,"I was  abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,You know  the Fowler words?"
243,Obara,Tyene,"I need no mighty  host, only one sweet sister.Obara?Tyene."
244,Elia,Tywin,"And last of all the little king, for my father.The boy has never wronged us.The boy is a bastard born of treason, incest, and adultery, if Lord Stannis can be believed."
245,Elia,Obara,"Only royal blood can wash out my fathers murder.Oberyn died during single combat, fighting in a matter that was none of his concern.I do not  call that murder.Call it what you will.We sent them the finest man in Dorne, and they are sending back a bag  of bones.He went beyond anything I asked of him."
246,Elia,Oberyn,   the Lady Nym broke in.
247,Areo,Hot,Make way for Prince Doran!
248,Areo,Hot,Make way for the Prince of Dorne!The prince is dead!
249,Areo,Hot,To spears!
250,Areo,Hot,Doran!
251,Areo,Hot,To the spears!
252,Areo,Hot,To spears!Vengeance for the Viper!
253,Pyg,Timeon,
254,Doran,Hot,To the spears!
255,Arianne,Hot,"Father,Sunspear rejoices at your return.Yes, I heard the joy."
256,Doran,Hot,"You look well.Captain, be so good as to help me down from here."
257,Doran,Hot,"I have commanded the cooks to prepare a feast for this evening,with all your  favorite dishes.I fear I could not do them justice."
258,Doran,Hot,I do not see  Tyene.She begs a private word.I sent her to the throne room to await your coming.
259,Doran,Hot,Very well.
260,Doran,Hot,"The sooner I am done with this, the sooner I may rest."
261,Hot,Oberyn,"Uncle,I have been waiting for you.Captain, help me to the high seat."
262,Oberyn,Tyene,Does it hurt so much?
263,Oberyn,Tyene,"Is there aught that I might do to ease your pain?Say what you would and let me rest.I am weary, Tyene.I made this for you, Uncle."
264,Oberyn,Tyene,"When I finish,  it is yours, to help you remember him.I am not like to forget your father.That is good to know.Many have wondered.Lord Tywin has promised us the Mountains head.He is so kind... but a headsmans sword is no fit end for brave Ser Gregor."
265,Doran,Oberyn,"Soon we may hear the Mountain screaming, even  here in Sunspear."
266,Doran,Myrcella,Obara cries to me for war.
267,Doran,Myrcella,"And you?War,"
268,Doran,Myrcella,"When the Lannisters and the Tyrells come down on us, we shall bleed  them in the passes and bury them beneath the blowing sands, as we have a hundred times  before.If they should come down on us.Oh, but they must, or see the realm riven once more, as it was before we wed the dragons."
269,Trystane,Tyene,"She was made to be a queen, just like  her mother."
270,Trystane,Tyene,"I would be honored to arrange the wedding,  and to see to the making of the crowns as well."
271,Myrcella,Tyene,"Then we need only hail Myrcella as  the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and lawful heir to  the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and wait for the lions to come.The lawful heir?"
272,Myrcella,Tyene,"She is older than her brother,By law the Iron  Throne should pass to her.By Dornish law.When good King Daeron wed Princess Myriah and brought us into his kingdom, it was agreed  that Dornish law would always rule in Dorne.And Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens.So she is."
273,Myrcella,Tyene,Let me think on it.
274,Myrcella,Tyene,"You think too much, Uncle.Do I?Father said so.Oberyn thought too little.Some men think because they are afraid to do.There is a difference between fear and caution.Oh, I must pray that I never see you frightened, Uncle.You might forget to breathe."
275,Doran,Tyene,"My lady, you  presume.Step from the dais, if it please you.I meant no harm, Captain.I love my uncle, as I know he loved my father."
276,Doran,Tyene,"I have said all I came to say, Uncle."
277,Doran,Tyene,"Do I still have your love?Always.Give me your blessing, then, and I shall go."
278,Caleotte,Doran,"Be brave, child.Oh, how not?I am his daughter."
279,Caleotte,Doran,"My prince, she  did not... here, let me see your hand."
280,Caleotte,Doran,"No, good."
281,Chett,Jaime,  The prince withdrew his hand.
282,Areo,Hot,"Captain,how loyal are my  guards?Loyal."
283,Areo,Hot,All of them?Or some?They are good men.
284,Areo,Hot,They will do as I command.
285,Areo,Hot,I will bring the head of any man who would betray you.I want no heads.I want obedience.You have it.
286,Areo,Hot,How many men are  needed?I will leave that for you to decide.
287,Areo,Hot,"I want this done as quickly and as quietly as possible, with no blood spilled.Quick and quiet and bloodless, aye.What is your command?You will find my brothers daughters, take them into custody, and confine them in the cells  atop the Spear Tower.The Sand Snakes?"
288,Doran,Hot,"All... all eight, my prince?The little ones,  also?"
289,Doran,Hot,"Ellarias girls are too young to be a danger, but there are those who  might seek to use them against me."
290,Doran,Hot,"Yes, the little  ones as well... but first secure Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara.As my prince commands."
291,Doran,Hot,"What  of Sarella?She is a woman grown, almost twenty.Unless she returns to Dorne, theres naught I can do about Sarella save pray that she shows  more sense than her sisters."
292,Chett,Doran,I shall not sleep until  I know that they are safe and under guard.It will be done.
293,Chett,Doran,"When this is known in the streets, the common folk  will howl.All Dorne will howl,I only pray Lord Tywin hears them  in Kings Landing, so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear."
294,Cersei,Jaime,What do you want of me?
295,Cersei,Jaime,Jaime?
296,Cersei,Jaime,Your Grace.
297,Cersei,Jaime,The Lord Commander said come get you.
298,Cersei,Senelle,"My lord father keeps guards about him, night and day,"
299,Boros,Osmund,"The guards were at their posts, Your Grace,We found a hidden  door behind the hearth."
300,Jaime,Osmund,The Lord Commanders gone down to see where it  goes.Jaime?
301,Jaime,Osmund,Jaime should be with the king...
302,Jaime,Osmund,His Grace is  sleeping peaceful.
303,Jaime,Loras,"Who is with the king?Ser Loras has that honor, if it please you."
304,Loras,Osmund,Allow me a moment to dress.
305,Cersei,Osmund,"Ser Boros, roust the gaolers and make certain  the dwarf is still in his cell."
306,Cersei,Osmund,As Your Grace commands.
307,Cersei,Osmund,"Who found him?One of his guards,Lum.He felt a call of nature, and found his lordship in  the privy."
308,Cersei,Tywin,"No one is to enter or leave without my permission,"
309,Cersei,Meryn,"Clear these  people away,Is my father in the privy?They carried him back to his bed, mlady."
310,Catelyn,Robb,"Take the quarrel out of him,This is the Kings Hand!"
311,Jaime,Robert,How could you leave him like this?
312,Puckens,Pycelle,Where is Pycelle?
313,Puckens,Pycelle,"Puckens, bring Grand Maester Pycelle.He must see to Lord Tywin.Hes seen him, Your Grace,He came and saw and went, to summon the silent  sisters."
314,Puckens,Pycelle,"Find Maester  Ballabar,Find Maester Frenken.Any of them."
315,Puckens,Pycelle,Where is my brother?Down the tunnel.
316,Puckens,Pycelle,Ser Jaime went to see how  deep it goes.
317,Cersei,Puckens,"Your Grace,this here claims he was a maester."
318,Cersei,Puckens,How may I serve Your Grace?
319,Jaime,Qyburn,You wear no maesters chain.It was taken from me.
320,Jaime,Qyburn,"I treated your brothers  hand.His stump, you mean."
321,Harren,Jaime,"I could not save Ser Jaimes hand, it is true."
322,Harren,Qyburn,"The Citadel took my chain, but they could not take my knowledge.You may suffice,If you fail me you will lose more than a chain, I promise you.Remove the quarrel from my fathers belly and make him ready for the silent sisters.As my queen commands."
323,Cersei,Qyburn,"And how shall I  deal with the girl, Your Grace?Girl?"
324,Cersei,Joffrey,"What is she doing here?We found her there, Your Grace,Its the Imps whore."
325,Cersei,Tywin,"This is not... when Lord Tywins father died he  returned to Casterly Rock to find a... a woman of this sort... bedecked in his lady mothers  jewels, wearing one of her gowns."
326,Cersei,Qyburn,   Qyburn suggested.
327,Cersei,Tyrion,"He was questioning her, to be sure.There  can be no doubt."
328,Cersei,Osfryd,"There is a dead woman in the  Hands bedchamber,No one is ever to know that she was  here.Aye, mlady."
329,Osney,Tyrion,And what shall we do with her?Feed her to your dogs.
330,Osfryd,Osney,Do you understand me?
331,Osfryd,Osney,"Aye, Your Grace."
332,Sansa,Shae,You were her maid.Do you expect me to  believe that you knew nothing of her plans?
333,Cersei,Osfryd,"I want that chain,See  that you do not scratch the gold."
334,Cersei,Osfryd,"No, not through  the yard."
335,Cersei,Osfryd,Theres a shaft down to the dungeons.That  way.
336,Cersei,Tywin,"Get out of my way,"
337,Cersei,Tywin,Did you find them?
338,Cersei,Tywin,How many were  there?
339,Cersei,Tyrion,The shaft goes down to a chamber where half a dozen  tunnels meet.
340,Cersei,Tyrion,I need to find keys.
341,Jaime,Tyrion,"Whoever did this might still be lurking in the walls.Its a maze  back there, and dark."
342,Jaime,Tyrion,Take hammers to the walls.
343,Jaime,Tyrion,I want them killed.
344,Qyburn,Tommen,"We are his heirs, Jaime,It will be up to us to finish his work."
345,Cersei,Genna,"  He pushed away from her and raised his arm, forcing his stump into her face."
346,Qyburn,Tommen,Dont ask me to rule.
347,Cersei,Jaime,Rule?
348,Cersei,Jaime,"I shall rule until my son comes of age.I dont know who I pity more,Tommen, or the Seven Kingdoms."
349,Jaime,Jon,Your father lies here dead.Have the decency to take  your quarrel outside.
350,Jaime,Jon,"Forgive us, Uncle."
351,Jaime,Jon,She forgets  herself.
352,Cersei,Meryn,"Trant, bring me Lord Varys.Squealing and squirming if need be, but unharmed.As Your Grace commands."
353,Boros,Meryn,"Gone,"
354,Boros,Meryn,"The Imp... his cells open, Your Grace... no sign of him  anywhere...I gave orders,He was to be kept under guard, night and  day...One of the gaolers has gone missing too."
355,Boros,Joffrey,Two other men we found asleep.
356,Boros,Joffrey,"I hope you did not wake them, Ser Boros.Let them  sleep.Sleep?"
357,Boros,Joffrey,"Aye, Your Grace.  "
358,Boros,Joffrey,I will not suffer guards to sleep on watch.
359,Boros,Tyrion,"Get away from me,Get away!"
360,Cersei,Tyrion,Your Grace?
361,Cersei,Tyrion,Shall I fetch a cup of water?
362,Cersei,Tyrion,"I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten,A highborn maid and very beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair."
363,Brienne,Sansa,"Have you seen her?Not as I recall, ser,But Ill keep my eye out, that  I will."
364,Brienne,Sansa,"If shes on the roads these days she wont  be no maid for long,"
365,Brienne,Jaime,"I will find the girl and keep her safe,For her lady mothers sake.And for yours."
366,Brienne,Jaime,"Twixt here and Duskendale is safe enough,but past Duskendale theres outlaws, and broken men in the woods."
367,Brienne,Sansa,"We have trout enough for three, ser,"
368,Brienne,Chett,"I thank you, ser."
369,Brienne,Chett,"A lady,  is it?"
370,Brienne,Chett,"Illy, gods be good, the size of her.I took her for a knight as well,"
371,Brienne,Creighton,"Sers,have you seen a maid of three-and-ten upon the road?"
372,Brienne,Creighton,"I recall no such maid.What sort of hair is  auburn?Browny red,No, we saw her not.We saw her not, mlady,Come, dismount, the fish is almost done.Are  you hungry?"
373,Brienne,Creighton,"A hedge knight and a robber knight are two sides of the same sword,"
374,Brienne,Creighton,"Might I know your names, sers?I have the honor to be Ser Creighton Longbough, of whom the singers sing,You will have heard of my deeds on the Blackwater, mayhaps.My companion is  Ser Illifer the Penniless."
375,Brienne,Creighton,"I thank you, good sers,I will gladly share your trout."
376,Brienne,Creighton,"We are bound for Duskendale, mlady,You would do well to ride with us.The roads are perilous."
377,Brienne,Jaime,"I thank you, ser, but I have no need of your protection.I insist.A true knight must defend the gentler sex."
378,Brienne,Jaime,"This will defend me, ser.A sword is only as good as the man who wields it.I wield it well enough.As you will."
379,Cleos,Jaime,Three together may ride more safely than one alone.
380,Cleos,Creighton,Your mounts could not keep up with mine.
381,Creighton,Illifer,"My steed served me well enough on the Blackwater,Why, I did great  carnage there and won a dozen ransoms."
382,Brienne,Illifer,"When swords clash, you shall neer find  Ser Creighton Longbough to the rear."
383,Brienne,Illifer,"Creigh, leave off.The likes o her has no need for the likes  o us.The likes of me?"
384,Harren,Jaime,"You bear a  liars shield, to which you have no right."
385,Harren,Jaime,"None since has dared to show that bat, black as the deeds of them that bore it."
386,Creighton,Illifer,"I lost  mine own shield,A true knight is the only shield a maiden needs,"
387,Creighton,Illifer,"A barefoot man looks for a boot, a chilly man a cloak."
388,Lucas,Renly,"Why wear such arms, I ask myself, unless your own sin is fouler still... and  fresher."
389,Lucas,Renly,"A woman freakish big and  freakish strong who hides her own true colors.Creigh, behold the Maid o Tarth, who opened  Renlys royal throat for him.That is a lie."
390,Creighton,Illifer,"I would have given my life for King Renly, and died happy,I did  no harm to him.I swear it by my sword.A knight swears by his sword,Swear it by the Seven,By the Seven, then."
391,Creighton,Illifer,"And I swear it by the Stranger, may he take me  now if I am false.She swears well, for a maid,Aye."
392,Creighton,Illifer,"Well, if shes lied, the gods will sort her out."
393,Brienne,Illifer,The first watch is yours.
394,Creighton,Illifer,"Oh, it was a rare fight, mlady,a rare and bloody fray."
395,Brienne,Illifer,Did anyone pass by during your watches?
396,Brienne,Illifer,"Such as a maid of three-and-ten, with auburn hair?"
397,Creighton,Illifer,"No, my  lady.No one.I had a few,Some farm boy on a piebald horse went by, and an hour  later half a dozen men afoot with staves and scythes."
398,Brienne,Creighton,"Rough fellows, by the look o them, and desperate too, but neer so desperate as to  trifle with Ser Creighton Longbough."
399,Brienne,Creighton,What is that  sound?
400,Brienne,Creighton,"Voices, raised in prayer."
401,Brienne,Illifer,They are close now.
402,Chett,Illifer,"Good knights,the Mother loves you.And you, brother,Who are you?Poor fellows,"
403,Creighton,Illifer,"We are marching to the city,to bring these holy  bones to Blessed Baelor, and seek succor and protection from the king.Join us, friends,Westeros has need of every sword.We were bound for Duskendale,but mayhaps we could see you  safely to Kings Landing.If you have the coin to pay us for this escort,Sparrows need no gold,"
404,Creighton,Illifer,"Sparrows?The sparrow is the humblest and most common of birds, as we are the humblest and most  common of men."
405,Creighton,Illifer,"These are the bones of holy men, murdered for their faith."
406,Brienne,Illifer,"Come with us to the city, if you love  the Seven.I love them well enough,yet I must eat.So must all the Mothers children.We are bound for Duskendale,"
407,Brienne,Illifer,"You are false knights,"
408,Brienne,Illifer,"Judge not, for judgment is the Fathers."
409,Brienne,Illifer,"They are poor fellows too, lost upon the earth."
410,Brienne,Illifer,"My sister is lost as well.A girl of three-and-ten with auburn  hair, fair to look upon.All the Mothers children are fair to look upon.May the Maiden watch over this poor girl...  and you as well, I think."
411,Brienne,Creighton,What sort of man would slay  a holy septon?
412,Brienne,Creighton,"A man would need to be a fool to rape a silent sister,Even to lay  hands upon one... its said they are the Strangers wives, and their female parts are cold and wet  as ice."
413,Brienne,Creighton,Uh... beg pardon.
414,Brienne,Shadrich,"You will forgive me if I am suspicious,but the times are  troubled, and I have only good Ser Shadrich to defend me. Ser Creighton said, affronted, "
415,Brienne,Sansa,"My lady, you should be safe at home.Why do you  wear such unnatural garb?I am searching for my sister."
416,Creighton,Sansa,"She is a highborn maid and beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair.Perhaps you saw  her with a portly knight of forty years, or a drunken fool.The roads are full of drunken fools and despoiled maidens.As to portly knights, it is hard for  any honest man to keep his belly round when so many lack for food... though your Ser Creighton  has not hungered, it would seem.I have big bones,Shall we ride together for a time?I do not doubt  Ser Shadrichs valor, but he seems small, and three blades are better than one."
417,Brienne,Shadrich,"What say you, ser?Oh, these three are nought to fear."
418,Jaime,Shadrich,"The one is old, tother fat, and the big one is  a woman.Let them come.As you say."
419,Jaime,Shadrich,"Youre a strapping healthy wench, Id say."
420,Jaime,Shadrich,"A giant,  compared to some."
421,Jaime,Shadrich,"I am big enough where it counts, wench.The merchant called you Shadrich.Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen.Some call me the Mad Mouse."
422,Jaime,Shadrich,"The brown is  for the lands Ive roamed, the blue for the rivers that Ive crossed.The mouse is me.And are you mad?Oh, quite."
423,Brienne,Shadrich,The mad mouse seeks them  out.It would seem he seldom finds them.I find enough.
424,Brienne,Shadrich,"I save my valor for the battlefield, woman."
425,Brienne,Shadrich,"You and good Ser Creighton have  much in common, then."
426,Brienne,Shadrich,"Oh, I doubt that, but it may be that you and I share a quest."
427,Brienne,Shadrich,With blue eyes and auburn hair?
428,Brienne,Shadrich,You are not the only hunter in  the woods.I seek for Sansa Stark as well.
429,Brienne,Creighton,"Who is this Sansa Stark, and why do you  seek her?For love, why else?"
430,Brienne,Creighton,"Love?Aye, love of gold."
431,Shadrich,Varys,"If some oversized  wench would help me find this naughty child, I would split the Spiders coin with her.I thought you were in this merchants hire.Only so far as Duskendale."
432,Shadrich,Varys,"What  say you, wench?I know no Sansa Stark,I am searching for my sister, a highborn girl..."
433,Dontos,Shadrich,Or did you name him fool?
434,Dontos,Shadrich,"A certain fool vanished from Kings Landing the night King Joffrey died, a stout  fellow with a nose full of broken veins, one Ser Dontos the Red, formerly of Duskendale."
435,Dontos,Jaime,That could be  most unfortunate.
436,Creighton,Illifer,"Not a bad cook, and the  rooms have no more fleas than most,Whos for a warm bed tonight?Not us, unless your friend is giving them away,We have no  coin for rooms.I can pay for the three of us."
437,Brienne,Tommen,"Let me do that, ser.I am no ser,but you may take the horse."
438,Brienne,Tommen,"Beg pardons, mlady.  "
439,Brienne,Shadrich,"Have a look at  that,"
440,Creighton,Shadrich,"Do you have rooms, good man?"
441,Creighton,Shadrich,"I might,for them as has coin."
442,Brienne,Creighton,"Naggle, is that how you would greet an old friend?Tis me, Longbough.Tis you indeed."
443,Brienne,Creighton,Show me some silver and Ill show you a bed.
444,Brienne,Creighton,"I will pay for one room for myself, and a second for my two companions."
445,Creighton,Illifer,"I shall take a room as well,for myself and good Ser Shadrich."
446,Illifer,Shadrich,"It dont please me, but might be Ill allow it."
447,Brienne,Shadrich,"Thats good goat on the spit, that is.I shall judge its goodness for myself,My men will content themselves  with bread and drippings."
448,Brienne,Sansa,"You come from Kings Landing,Is it true that the  Kingslayers been crippled?True enough,Hes lost his sword hand.Aye,"
449,Brienne,Creighton,"Even their gods are queer.It was not a wolf,Ser Jaime lost his hand to a Qohorik  sellsword.It is no easy thing to fight with your off hand,Bah,As it happens, I fight as well with either hand.Oh, I have no doubt of that."
450,Aemon,Jaime,"Youll be defending Eddard Starks daughter with Eddard Starks own steel,"
451,Brienne,Jaime,"... Ser Creighton was saying as he went by, "
452,Chett,Samwell,"Lord Orbert rose at dawn and moved his bowels,Lord Orbert was found to have died during the night."
453,Jon,Samwell,"You shouldnt  eat the books, though,"
454,Baelor,Stannis,"Samwell,I was coming to fetch you."
455,Baelor,Grenn,"Jon wants to see me?As to that, I could not say,I never wanted to see half the things  Ive seen, and Ive never seen half the things I wanted to."
456,Grenn,Samwell,Lord Snow wishes to speak with you as soon as he is done with  Crasters wife.Gilly.Thats the one.
457,Grenn,Samwell,"Mine had  whiskers.Most goats do,Where have you been, Slayer?"
458,Grenn,Samwell,A whole roast ox went uneaten.Dont call me Slayer.
459,Grenn,Samwell,"I was reading.  Hes terrified of mice.I am not,Youd be too scared to eat one.Id eat more mice than you would."
460,Alliser,Grenn,"When I was a lad, we only ate mice on special feast days."
461,Alliser,Grenn,"Theres no meat on the tail.Wheres your longbow, Samwell"
462,Jon,Samwell,"Ulmer  was expecting you at the butts.Ulmer,"
463,Samwell,Satin,"I forgot.You broke the heart of the wildling princess, Slayer,"
464,Aemon,Samwell,She was looking for  you.She was not!Dont say that!
465,Samwell,Stannis,Why not?
466,Samwell,Stannis,She wants to have your children.Maybe we should call you Samwellthe  Seducer.
467,Jon,Stannis,"I dont have time for archery  today, I need to go see Jon.Jon?"
468,Jon,Stannis,"Do we know anyone named Jon, Grenn?He means the Lord Commander.Ohhh."
469,Jon,Samwell,He cant even wiggle  his ears.
470,Janos,Samwell,"Hes  Lord Snow for true now, too bloody highborn for the likes of us.Jon has duties,The Wall is his, and all that goes with it.A man has duties to his friends as well."
471,Grenn,Samwell,"We  saved him from that, but now he has too many duties to drink a cup of mulled wine by the fire?"
472,Grenn,Samwell,"His duties dont keep him from the yard.More days than not, hes out there  fighting someone."
473,Jon,Samwell,"The Old Bear never trained much  when he was Lord Commander,"
474,Jon,Samwell,"Valyrian steel,"
475,Jon,Samwell,The Halfhand could have killed me as easy as you swat a bug.
476,Jon,Samwell,"When I try to swat a bug, it always flies away."
477,Jon,Samwell,It stings.
478,Jon,Samwell,As you will.Qhorin could have killed me as easy as you eat a bowl of  porridge.
479,Jon,Samwell,I dont have time for this.
480,Gilly,Samwell,Gilly.Samwell
481,Gilly,Samwell,Whats wrong?
482,Gilly,Samwell,How are the babes?
483,Gilly,Samwell,"Theyre good, Samwell Good.Between the two of them its a wonder you can sleep,Which one was it  that I heard crying last night?I thought hed never stop.Dallas boy."
484,Colemon,Petyr, Her eyes filled with tears.
485,Gilly,Samwell,Ill be  leaking all over myself if I dont go.
486,Gilly,Hairy,Lord Snow is waiting.
487,Jon,Samwell,"Corn, corn!"
488,Jon,Samwell,"Close the door, SamwellDid that wretch break the skin?"
489,Jon,Samwell,He did.
490,Jon,Samwell,Im bleeding.We all shed our blood for the Watch.Wear thicker gloves.
491,Jon,Samwell,"Sit, and have a look at this."
492,Jon,Samwell,What is it?
493,Aemon,Samwell,A paper shield.
494,Bran,Jon,A letter to King Tommen?At Winterfell Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords.
495,Bran,Jon,Bran knocked him to the ground.
496,Bran,Samwell,"Yet Brans dead, and pudgy pink-faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a  crown nestled amongst his golden curls."
497,Coldhands,Janos,You havent signed the letter.The Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times.
498,Janos,Samwell,"Not once they hear that weve been helping  Stannis.Only to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion."
499,Jon,Samwell,Thats  what it says here.The distinction may escape Lord Tywin.
500,Jon,Stannis,"Why would he help us  now?He never did before.Well,he will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst  King Tommen was playing with his toys."
501,Jon,Stannis,"The Nights Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,Our  oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril.   said Samwell squirming, Are we?I gave Stannis food, shelter, and the Nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the Gift.Thats all.Lord Tywin will say it was too much.Stannis says its not enough."
502,Robb,Samwell,"Pleasing two is  hardly possible.Yes, but... if the Lannisters should prevail and Lord Tywin decides that we betrayed the king  by aiding Stannis, it could mean the end of the Nights Watch."
503,Robb,Samwell,And he did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.
504,Robb,Stannis,The Blackwater was one battle.
505,Daenerys,Reznak,
506,Samwell,Tywin,The Lannisters have northmen of their own.Lord Bolton and his bastard.Stannis has the Karstarks.   Samwellstressed.
507,Jon,Samwell,I suppose so.
508,Jon,Samwell,Get the sealing wax.
509,Gilly,Samwell,"Take this to Maester Aemon when you leave,and tell him to dispatch a bird to Kings Landing.I will."
510,Gilly,Samwell,"My lord, if I might ask..."
511,Gilly,Samwell,She was almost crying.Val sent her to plead for Mance again.Oh.
512,Mance,Samwell,"What did you tell her?That I would speak to Stannis, though I doubt my words will sway him."
513,Jon,Stannis,No one has ever said he was forgiving.
514,Jon,Stannis,I would sooner take off Mances head myself.
515,Jon,Melisandre,"By rights, his life belongs to us.Pyp says that Lady Melisandre means to give him to the flames, to work some sorcery.Pyp should learn to hold his tongue."
516,Jon,Samwell,Theres no power in brigands blood.
517,Jon,Samwell,"Blood,"
518,Jon,Samwell,I am sending Gilly away.Oh.
519,Jon,Samwell,"Well, thats... thats good, my lord."
520,Jon,Samwell,"Her and the boy.We will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother.Goats milk might serve, until you do.Its better for a babe than cows milk."
521,Jon,Samwell,"My lord, when I was looking through the annals I came  on another boy commander."
522,Jon,Samwell,"Youre fifth youngest, so far.The younger four all being sons, brothers, or bastards of the King in the North."
523,Jon,Samwell,Tell me of our enemy.The Others.
524,Jon,Samwell,"They are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as I  would have thought."
525,Hero,Jon,   Jon broke in.
526,Jon,Small,"Men who fall in battle  against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.We knew all this.The question is, how do we fight them?The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel."
527,Jon,Samwell,I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others  with a blade of dragonsteel.Supposedly they could not stand against it.Dragonsteel?
528,Jon,Samwell,"Valyrian steel?That was my first thought as well.So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all  is saved?That wont be hard."
529,Jon,Samwell,"Did you find who the Others are,  where they come from, what they want?Not yet, my lord, but it may be that Ive just been reading the wrong books."
530,Jon,Samwell,Give me more time and I will find whatever there is to be  found.There is no more time.
531,Jon,Samwell,"You need to get your things together, Samwell Youre  going with Gilly.Going?"
532,Jon,Samwell,Im going?
533,Jon,Samwell,  
534,Aemon,Clydas,Aemon as well.Aemon?
535,Aemon,Clydas,"  Hes been with Aemon for years.Clydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad."
536,Horton,Petyr," He thought of the Arbor and the Arbor Queen, and almost choked on his  tongue.  "
537,Aemon,Samwell,  
538,Aemon,Samwell,Dareon will join you at Eastwatch.
539,Gilly,Samwell,"Elsewise, Aemon will find a servants place for her at the Citadel.My b-b-bastard."
540,Gilly,Jon,"Yes, I... my mother and my sisters will help Gilly with the child."
541,Gilly,Jon,Dareon could see her to Oldtown just as well as me.
542,Jon,Samwell,The longbow makes  my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers.
543,Jon,Samwell,"I  still do it, though."
544,Jon,Samwell,Someone needs to write them down and put them  in a book.You do it.
545,Jon,Samwell,I need you to become my new maester.
546,Aemon,Samwell,"My lord, I... my work is here, the books...... will be here when you return to us."
547,Aemon,Samwell,"My lord, the  Citadel... they make you cut up corpses there."
548,Aemon,Jon,I cannot  wear a chain.You can.
549,Aemon,Jon,"Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar,  and Maester Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than hes sober.If you ask the Citadel for more maesters..."
550,Aemon,Jon,"Aemon Targaryen is not so easily replaced,  however."
551,Aemon,Jon,I was certain this would please you.
552,Jon,Samwell,"You would do well there, Samwell I know you  would.No.I could read the books, but... a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me faint."
553,Jon,Samwell,"Im Samwellthe Scared, not Samwellthe Slayer.Scared?"
554,Jon,Samwell,"You slew an Other.It was the d-d-d-dragonglass, not me.Be quiet."
555,Jon,Samwell,At least in  Oldtown the corpses wont object.
556,Jon,Samwell,"My lord,my f-f-f-father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he...  the life of a maester is a life of servitude."
557,Jon,Samwell,No son of House Tarly  will ever wear a chain.The men of Horn Hill do not bow and scrape to petty lords.
558,Jon,Samwell,"Jon, I cannot disobey my father."
559,Chett,Jon,"You have no father,Only brothers."
560,Jon,Samwell,"You said  the words, Samwell Remember?"
561,Jon,Samwell,I... Ill try.You wont try.You will obey.Obey.
562,Jon,Samwell,As my lord commands.Does... does Maester Aemon know?It was as much his idea as mine.
563,Jon,Samwell,No farewells.
564,Jon,Samwell,"An hour before first light, by the lichyard."
565,Jon,Samwell,He does not understand.
566,Daeron,Samwell,"If I don a chain, my lord f-f-f-father... he, he, he...My own father raised the same objections when I chose a life of service,It  was his father who sent me to the Citadel."
567,Aemon,Daeron,"Too many dragons are as dangerous as too few, I heard His Grace tell my lord  father, the day they sent me off."
568,Aemon,Samwell,"The chain is heavy, Samwell but my grandsire had the right of it.So does your Lord Snow.Snow,Snow,"
569,Aemon,Samwell,"Snow,  snow, snow, snow, snow."
570,Hobb,Samwell,"Youre a man who appreciates cooking, Slayer,We need  more o your sort."
571,Aemon,Samwell,"Dont mind him, Slayer,He lost a wager, said wed  need to drag you out squealing from beneath some bed."
572,Clydas,Samwell,"Keep hold of  my arm, maester.Its not far."
573,Gilly,Samwell,It is always warm in Oldtown.
574,Gilly,Jon,"It  will be pleasant to sit there once again, sipping cider."
575,Gilly,Jon,"Lord Snow,"
576,Aemon,Jon,"Ive  told Clydas to mark it for you.Ill be sure to read it,"
577,Aemon,Jon,"Knowledge is a weapon, Jon.Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle.I will."
578,Gilly,Jon,"Make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks."
579,Gilly,Jon,"See that you keep them warm and well fed.You do the same, mlord,You do the same for tother."
580,Gilly,Jon,"The boy... Dallas boy... the little prince, I mean...  you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong.You have my word,Dont you name him."
581,Gilly,Jon,"You crows may not know that, but its true.As you command, my lady."
582,Gilly,Jon,Dont you call me that.
583,Gilly,Jon,"Im Crasters wife and Crasters daughter, and a mother."
584,Clydas,Samwell,"Lets do this,"
585,Clydas,Jon,"Well,farewell.And to you, SamwellYour boats not like to sink, I dont think.Boats only  sink when Im aboard."
586,Craster,Jon,"The first time I saw Gilly,she was pressed back  against the wall of Crasters Keep, this skinny dark-haired girl with her big belly, cringing away  from Ghost."
587,Craster,Jon,"She has more courage than she knows.So do you, Samwell Have a swift, safe voyage, and take care of her and Aemon and the child."
588,Craster,Jon,And pull your hood up.The snowflakes are melting in your  hair.
589,Arya,Jon,"It looks like a star,The star of home,"
590,Arya,Nan,"Its two stars now.Two eyes,The Titan sees us."
591,Nan,Sansa,"The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,"
592,Arya,Chett,"I hope your Titan isnt hungry,Hungry?"
593,Arya,Chett,It takes no matter.
594,Arya,Chett,Is the Titan the god of Braavos?
595,Arya,Chett,Or do  you have the Seven?All gods are honored in Braavos.
596,Arya,Robb,"Your Seven have a sept here, the Sept-Beyond- the-Sea, but only Westerosi sailors worship there."
597,Arya,Rickon,"The Moonsingers led us to this place of refuge, where the dragons of Valyria could not find  us,Theirs is the greatest temple."
598,Arya,Gregor,That is where you will find the... the Many-Faced God.
599,Arya,Sandor,"Salty, look!"
600,Arya,Sandor,Can you see?There.
601,Arya,Baelor,"He  warns the Arsenal of our coming, that is all,You must not be afraid.I never was,It was loud, is all."
602,Arya,Nan,"The Braavosi feed him on  the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,"
603,Arya,Chett,"The Arsenal of Braavos,They can build a war galley there in a day."
604,Arya,Luwin,"Our walls  are made of wood and painted purple,Our galleys are our walls.We need no  other."
605,Arya,Chett,"Our voyage is at an end,We make for the Chequy Port,  where the Sealords customs officers will come aboard to inspect our holds."
606,Arya,Chett,"I shall lower a boat, and Yorko will put you ashore."
607,Arya,Chett,"Ashore,Valar dohaeris."
608,Arya,Chett,"I beg you remember Ternesio Terys and  the service he has done you.I will,"
609,Arya,Chett,Whats that?
610,Arya,Chett,"The sweetwater river,It brings fresh water from the mainland, across the mudflats and the briny shallows.Good sweet  water for the fountains."
611,Arya,Chett,Are they gods?
612,Arya,Chett,"Sealords,The Isle of the Gods is farther on."
613,Arya,Chett,That is the Temple of the Moonsingers.
614,Arya,Thoros,"The red priests love their fires,The Lord of Light is their god, red  Rhllor."
615,Cersei,Loras,"That is the Holy Refuge, where we honor the small gods the  world has forgotten."
616,Arya,Chett,"I never knew there were so many gods,"
617,Arya,Syrio,Here I leave you.
618,Arya,Syrio,"You know my name,Yorko Terys.Valar dohaeris."
619,Arya,Chett,"Let me in, you stupid,I crossed the narrow sea."
620,Arya,Chett,Jaqen told me to come.I have the iron coin.
621,Arya,Chett,See?Valar morghulis.
622,Arya,Chett,"Valar morghulis,Valar dohaeris,"
623,Arya,Chett,"Youre stabbed,"
624,Arya,Chett,"Dont grab me,I killed the boy who grabbed me last."
625,Arya,Chett,Dont you know the Common Tongue?I do.
626,Arya,Chett,What place is this?
627,Arya,Chett,A place of peace.
628,Arya,Chett,You are safe here.
629,Arya,Chett,"Though you are young to seek the favor of the Many-Faced God.Is he like the southron god, the one with seven faces?Seven?"
630,Chett,Jacelyn,You need not rush to his embrace.I only came to find Jaqen Hghar.I do not know this name.
631,Chett,Jacelyn,He was from Lorath.
632,Chett,Jacelyn,"He  said hed teach me secrets, and gave me this."
633,Chett,Jacelyn,"Tell me your name, child.Salty.I come from Saltpans, by the Trident."
634,Chett,Jacelyn,"No,Tell  me your name.Squab,Your true name, child.My mother named me Nan, but they call me Weasel...Your name."
635,Arya,Chett,Arry.Im Arry.Closer.And now the truth?
636,Arya,Chett,Arya.
637,Arya,Chett,"I am Arya, of House Stark.You are,but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.Please,I have no place to go.Do you fear death?"
638,Arya,Chett,No.Let us see.
639,Arya,Chett,"Kiss me, child,"
640,Arya,Tommen,"No one has ever tried to eat my worm before,Are you hungry, child?"
641,Joffrey,Tommen,"Uncle Jaime said I could ride my horse and throw pennies to the  smallfolk,Do you want to catch a chill?"
642,Joffrey,Tommen,Your grandfather would want you to look a proper king at his wake.We will not appear  at the Great Sept wet and bedraggled.
643,Cersei,Tommen,The gods are weeping for grandfather.Lady Jocelyn says the raindrops are their tears.Jocelyn Swyft is a fool.
644,Joffrey,Tommen,"That mantle is sable, would you have it  soaked?"
645,Joffrey,Tommen,"Dont slump so,Sit like a king."
646,Joffrey,Tommen,"Do you want it to tumble off your head in  front of all your lords?No, Mother."
647,Tommen,Tywin,"I thought there would be more people.When Father died, all the people came out to watch us go by.This rain has driven them inside."
648,Jaime,Tywin,"You cannot eat love, nor buy a horse with it, nor warm your halls on a  cold night,"
649,Cersei,Tommen,"Weep quietly,You are a king, not a squalling child.Your lords are watching you."
650,Aerys,Ryk,"If we need gold, His Grace should sit Lord Tywin on his  chamber pot."
651,Cersei,Tommen,Mother.
652,Cersei,Tommen,What smells so bad?
653,Cersei,Tommen,Death.
654,Margaery,Tommen,privy
655,Balman,Falyse,"My lady mother sends her  regrets, Your Grace,Lollys has been taken to bed with the child and she  felt the need to stay with her."
656,Cersei,Falyse,"Should my sister have a little boy, it is her  wish that we might name him Tywin, if... if it please you."
657,Cersei,Falyse,"Your lackwit sister gets herself raped by half of Kings Landing,  and Tanda thinks to honor the bastard with my lord fathers name?I think not."
658,Cersei,Tommen,"I told Lady Tanda as much.We shall find a more, ah... a more fitting  name for Lollyss bastard, you have my word.See that you do."
659,Ballabar,Cersei,"Lancel, I am happy to see you looking so much stronger."
660,Ballabar,Lancel,"But I would have thought  you on your way to Darry by now, to take up your lordship."
661,Kevan,Lancel,Not as yet.There are outlaws in my castle.
662,Cersei,Kevan,"The  riverlands have need of a strong hand, my father says."
663,Cersei,Lancel,And you are to be wed  as well.
664,Cersei,Lancel,"A Frey girl, and not of my  choosing."
665,Cersei,Lancel,"My father says that will help me  with the peasants, but the peasants are all dead."
666,Cersei,Lancel,"It is cruel, Cersei.   she finished for him."
667,Cersei,Lancel,I know you will do  many noble deeds in Darry.
668,Cersei,Lancel,"When it seemed that I might die, my father brought the  High Septon to pray for me.He is a good man."
669,Cersei,Lancel,"He says the Mother spared me for some holy purpose, so I might  atone for my sins."
670,Cersei,Robert,"Atonement is best achieved through prayer,Silent prayer."
671,Cersei,Tywin,"Your Grace,I have sent word to my friends across the narrow sea, asking them to seize the  Imp at once should he show his ugly face in the Free Cities.Do you have many friends across the water?In Myr, many."
672,Cersei,Tywin,Men of power.
673,Mace,Taena,"Lord  Merryweather and I wish only to serve Your Grace and the little king,"
674,Mace,Taena,"We must speak again, my lady."
675,Mace,Taena,I know that we shall be great friends.
676,Cersei,Tywin,"Lord Tywin was a great  man, an extraordinary man,We  shall never see his like again, I fear."
677,Cersei,Tommen,He will be greatly missed.
678,Cersei,Tommen,"No man alive is fit to don Lord Tywins armor, that is  plain."
679,Garlan,Tommen,"If there is aught that I might do to serve in this  dark hour, Your Grace need only ask."
680,Garlan,Tywin,"Surely my lord is needed in the Reach?My son Willas is an able lad,His  leg may be twisted but he has no want of wits."
681,Garth,Tywin,Perhaps in the  City Watch.
682,Garth,Mace,"Garth has served me well as Lord Seneschal, as he served my father before me,Petyr had a nose for gold, I grant you, but Garth...My lord,I fear there has been some misunderstanding."
683,Garth,Mace,Rosby?
684,Garth,Mace,Garth is  on his way to Oldtown.Best send a raven to Lord Hightower and ask him to make certain your uncle does not take  ship.We would hate for Garth to brave an autumn sea for nought.
685,Garth,Mace,This... your lord father assured me...
686,Garth,Olenna,"It would seem that Lord Tywin  did not share his plans with our regent, I cant imagine why."
687,Garth,Olenna,You know the  sea will sicken him and make his farting worse.
688,Cersei,Olenna,"Your council chambers will smell sweeter with Lord Gyles, though I daresay that coughing  would drive me to distraction."
689,Cersei,Garth,I do abhor foul smells.
690,Cersei,Olenna,"I caught  a whiff of something unpleasant in the holy sept, in truth.Mayhaps you smelled it too?No,A scent, you say?More like a stink.Perhaps you miss your autumn roses.We have kept you here too long."
691,Cersei,Olenna,"I do long for the fragrances of Highgarden, I confess it,but of course I  cannot leave until I have seen my sweet Margaery wed to your precious little Tommen.I await that day eagerly as well,Lord Tywin and I were on the point of setting  a date, as it happens.Perhaps you and I might take up that discussion, Your Grace.Soon.Soon will serve,Now come along, Mace, let Her Grace get  on with her...grief."
692,Cersei,Tommen,"Put that back on,It makes my neck hurt,Will I be married soon?Margaery says that as soon as were wed we can go to Highgarden.You are not going to Highgarden, but you can ride back to the castle."
693,Cersei,Meryn,"Bring His Grace a mount, and ask Lord Gyles if he would do me the honor of  sharing my litter."
694,Gyles,Petyr,"Name the cow what you will, so long as the milk flows.And should the question arise, you  joined the council yesterday.Yester...Yesterday.To be sure."
695,Gyles,Petyr,Your Grace?
696,Gyles,Petyr,"Might I......  ask who...... who will be the Kings Hand?My uncle,"
697,Jocelyn,Qyburn,"Send him in,"
698,Aerys,Qyburn,"I must  beg Your Graces pardon for my appearance,I have been down in the dungeons  making inquiries into the Imps escape, as you commanded.And what have you discovered?The night that Lord Varys and your brother disappeared, a third man also vanished.Yes, the gaoler.What of him?Rugen was the mans name."
699,Addam,Jaime,His chamber pot was overflowing.I know all this.
700,Addam,Jaime,"Aye, Your Grace,but did you know that under that stinking chamber pot was a  loose stone, which opened on a small hollow?"
701,Addam,Tyrion,"Coin, you mean?"
702,Qyburn,Tyrion,Beyond a doubt.
703,Cersei,Qyburn,"But as I crouched over the hole with my torch, I saw  something glitter, so I scratched in the dirt until I dug it out."
704,Cersei,Qyburn,A gold  coin.
705,Cersei,Qyburn,"This is no dragon,No,It dates from before the Conquest, Your Grace.The king is Garth the  Twelfth, and the hand is the sigil of House Gardener."
706,Qyburn,Tywin,"You  will not speak of this with anyone,Your Grace may trust in my discretion.Any man who rides with a sellsword company learns  to hold his tongue, else he does not keep it long.In my company as well."
707,Pycelle,Qyburn,What  of the other matter?Ser Gregor.
708,Pycelle,Qyburn,"I have examined him, as you commanded.The poison on the  Vipers spear was manticore venom from the east, I would stake my life on that.Pycelle says no.He told my lord father that manticore venom kills the instant it reaches the  heart.And so it does.But this venom has been thickened somehow, so as to draw out the Mountains  dying.Thickened?"
709,Pycelle,Qyburn,"With some other substance?It may be as Your Grace suggests, though in most cases adulterating a poison only lessens its  potency."
710,Pycelle,Qyburn,"A spell, I think."
711,Pycelle,Qyburn,So are you telling me that the Mountain is dying of some  black sorcery?
712,Pycelle,Qyburn,"He is dying of the venom, but slowly, and in  exquisite agony."
713,Gregor,Senelle,"It is a wonder that the man is still alive, if truth be  told.His size,Gregor is a very large man."
714,Gregor,Senelle,"Too stupid to know when he should die, it seems."
715,Gregor,Senelle,His screaming frightens Tommen.
716,Gregor,Senelle,"I  would say it is past time we summoned Ilyn Payne.Your Grace,mayhaps I might move Ser Gregor to the dungeons?"
717,Gregor,Senelle,"Let Ser Ilyn tend to him.If that is Your Graces wish,"
718,Brienne,Podrick,
719,Marwyn,Pycelle,Why did the Citadel  take your chain?The archmaesters are all craven at heart.
720,Gregor,Qyburn,For that crime the grey sheep shamed me and forced  me into exile... but I understand the nature of life and death better than any man in Oldtown.Do you?
721,Gregor,Qyburn,Very well.
722,Gyles,Qyburn,"Prince Doran would no doubt prefer to kill Gregor himself, but we all must suffer  disappointments in this life.Very good, Your Grace."
723,Gyles,Qyburn,"I am not so well provided as Pycelle,  however.  "
724,Gyles,Qyburn,You look as though youve wandered up from Flea Bottom.
725,Cersei,Qyburn,"Need I say that it will go ill for you  if any word of your... labors... should pass beyond these walls?No, Your Grace."
726,Cersei,Qyburn,Your secrets are safe with me.
727,Jaime,Tommen,"I know how much my father relied on you, Uncle.Now I must do the same.You need a Hand,and Jaime has refused you."
728,Jaime,Tommen,Jaime...
729,Cersei,Tommen,  
730,Cersei,Tommen,Never.
731,Cersei,Tommen,"The Tyrells overreach  themselves.You would be a fool to make Mace Tyrell your Hand,"
732,Cersei,Tommen,"Mace should have known  better than to broach such matters in public, but even so, you were unwise to shame him in front  of half the court.Better that than suffer another Tyrell on the council."
733,Cersei,Tommen,Rosby will  make an adequate master of coin.
734,Cersei,Kevan,"As for Handship... who better to finish my fathers work than the brother  who shared all his counsels?Every man needs someone he can trust.Tywin had me, and once your mother.He loved her very much."
735,Cersei,Kevan,I know  they are together now.So I pray.
736,Cersei,Kevan,"You ask much of  me, Cersei.No more than my father did.I am tired."
737,Cersei,Kevan,"I have a wife I have not  seen in two years, a dead son to mourn, another son about to marry and assume a lordship."
738,Cersei,Kevan,Lancel needs my help.As does Tommen.
739,Cersei,Kevan,The realm needs you.The realm.
740,Cersei,Kevan,And House Lannister.
741,Cersei,Kevan,"Very well.   she started to say, but Ser Kevan raised his voice and bulled right over her."
742,Cersei,Tywin,"I am the regent,You were."
743,Cersei,Tywin,He told me of his plans to send  you back to the Rock and find a new husband for you.
744,Cersei,Tywin,"He spoke of such, yes.And I told him it was not my wish to  wed again."
745,Cersei,Tywin,"If you are resolved against another marriage, I will not force it on  you."
746,Cersei,Tywin,Your place is there.
747,Daenerys,Reznak,I am also the Queen Regent.
748,Cersei,Tywin,  
749,Cersei,Tywin,"With your help, Uncle.  And Tywin always regarded Jaime as his rightful heir.Jaime... Jaime has taken vows."
750,Cersei,Kevan,"Jaime is a handsome fool.And yet he was your first choice to be the Kings Hand.What does that make you, Cersei?I told you, I was sick with grief, I did not think...No,Which is why you should return to Casterly Rock and leave the king  with those who do.The king is my son!"
751,Cersei,Kevan,"Aye,and from what I saw of Joffrey, you are as unfit a mother as you are a  ruler."
752,Cersei,Kevan,Your Grace.
753,Kevan,Tywin,"With your leave, might I withdraw?By what right do you presume to give me terms?You are no more than one of my fathers  household knights.I hold no lands, that is true."
754,Rowan,Tywin,"You would be wise not to take me  lightly, Your Grace... and wiser still not to make of me a foe.Are you threatening me?I am counseling you.If you will not yield the regency to me, name me your castellan for  Casterly Rock and make either Mathis Rowan or Randyll Tarly the Hand of the King."
755,Rowan,Tywin,"Mathis Rowan is sensible, prudent, well liked,Randyll Tarly is  the finest soldier in the realm."
756,Moon,Rowan,"You strengthen yourself and weaken Highgarden, yet Mace will likely thank you for it."
757,Moon,Rowan,"That is my counsel, take it or no."
758,Mace,Moon,I am going to take him home.
759,Kevan,Mace,"You  would abandon your king when he needs you most,You would abandon  Tommen.Tommen has his mother."
760,Kevan,Mace,"Aye,and his father too, I think."
761,Balon,Jaime,"No man can stand a vigil for  seven days and seven nights,When did you last sleep, my lord?When my lord father was alive,Allow me to stand tonight in your stead,He was not your father."
762,Loras,Tyrion,"Leave me.As my lord commands,"
763,Chett,Varys,"I commanded the eunuch to take him to a ship, not to your  bedchamber,The blood is on his hands as much as... as Tyrions."
764,Jaime,Varys,"Why, Lord Varys,fancy meeting you  here.Ser Jaime?"
765,Jaime,Varys,You frightened me.I meant to.
766,Jaime,Varys,"I was  thinking you might help me pluck my brother from his cell before Ser Ilyn lops his head off.It is  an ugly head, I grant you, but he only has the one.Yes... well... if you would... remove the blade... yes, gently, as it please my lord, gently, oh,  Im pricked...I have  always abhorred the sight of my own blood.Youll have more to abhor shortly, unless you help me."
767,Jaime,Varys,"Your brother... if the Imp should vanish unaccountably  from his cell, q-questions would be asked.  "
768,Jaime,Varys,"If Tyrion dies, you will not long  outlive him, I promise you.Ah."
769,Jaime,Varys,"You ask a dreadful thing... to loose the Imp  who slew our lovely king.Or is it that you believe him innocent?Innocent or guilty,a Lannister pays his debts."
770,Jaime,Varys,"You poor stupid blind crippled fool,Cersei is a lying whore, shes been fucking Lancel and  Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know."
771,Jaime,Varys,"Yes, I killed your vile son."
772,Barristan,Tywin,"Your Grace,let Darry stay to guard the king this once, or  Ser Barristan."
773,Barristan,Tywin,My royal sire fears your father more than he does our cousin  Robert.
774,Jaime,Tywin,I dare not take that crutch away  from him at such an hour.
775,Jaime,Jon,"I am not a crutch.I am a knight of the Kingsguard.Then guard the king,When you donned that cloak, you  promised to obey."
776,Jaime,Jon,When this battles done I mean to call a  council.
777,Jaime,Jon,We shall talk when I return.
778,Jaime,Tywin,"Aerys  thought no harm could come to him if he kept me near,Isnt that  amusing?"
779,Jaime,Tywin,"Father,it was you who told me that tears were a  mark of weakness in a man, so you cannot expect that I should cry for you."
780,Pycelle,Tywin,"I have served six  kings,but  here before us lies the greatest man I ever knew."
781,Jaime,Pycelle,"Ser Jaime, I have seen terrible things in my time,Wars, battles, murders  most foul..."
782,Jaime,Pycelle,A man who did what was needed.Is that why he looks so pleased with himself?
783,Jaime,Pycelle,"The flesh... as the flesh  dries, the muscles grow taut and pull his lips upward.That is no smile, only a... a drying, that is  all."
784,Jaime,Pycelle,You must excuse me.I am so very tired.
785,Jaime,Tyrion,"I see you wonder, what sort of name is that?"
786,Jaime,Tyrion,"It is an old name, tis true."
787,Jaime,Tyrion,My father told me the tale when I was a tad of a lad.
788,Jaime,Tyrion,She was the fairest treasure of the Maidenvault.
789,Aerys,Jaime,"So I have a little dragon in me.Yes, I almost mistook you for Aegon the Conqueror,WatersAs it matters, though, I have more  pressing concerns than your lineage."
790,Aerys,Jaime,"The lost prisoner.And the missing gaoler.Rugen,An undergaoler.He had charge of the third level, the black  cells.Tell me of him,"
791,Aerys,Jaime,"Unkempt, unshaven, coarse of speech."
792,Aerys,Jaime,"I most suredly did, I  give you my word upon it, the word of a man with royal blood."
793,Aerys,Jaime,"Who saw these  reports?Certain of them went to the master of coin, others to the master of whisperers."
794,Jaime,Pycelle,It has always been so in the dungeons.
795,Jaime,Pycelle,"Rugen was here when need be, my lord."
796,Jaime,Pycelle,"I made note of that in a report as well, you may be certain of it.Tell me of the two gaolers who went to sleep.Gaolers?"
797,Jaime,Pycelle,Those were no gaolers.
798,Jaime,Pycelle,"We are supposed to have six undergaolers as well, two on each level, but  there are only the three.You and two others?"
799,Jaime,Pycelle,"I am the chief undergaoler, my lord."
800,Chett,Jaime,"If my lord would like to look over my books, he will see  that all the figures are exact."
801,Cersei,Jaime,"At present, we have four prisoners on the first level and one on the second, in  addition to your lordships brother."
802,Cersei,Jaime,"Who is fled, to be sure."
803,Cersei,Jaime,I  will strike him out.
804,Cersei,Jaime,I want to question these two turnkeys.
805,Cersei,Jaime,"Question  them, my lord?You heard me.I did, my lord, I suredly did, and yet... my lord may question who he pleases, tis true, it is not  my place to say that he may not."
806,Cersei,Jaime,"They are dead, my lord.Dead?By whose command?Your own, I thought, or... the kings, mayhaps?"
807,Cersei,Jaime,It... it is not my place to question  the Kingsguard.
808,Boros,Jaime,"You witless fools,What did you imagine you were doing?No moren we was told, my lord."
809,Jaime,Osmund,Her Grace  commanded it.Your sister.
810,Jaime,Osmund,"She said they were to sleep forever.So  my brothers and me, we saw to it."
811,Jaime,Osmund,"This was ill done,  ser."
812,Jaime,Osmund,"They wont be missed.Ill wager they was part of it, along with the one  whos gone missing."
813,Lancel,Osmund,"If so, we might  have coaxed the truth from them.If I had a suspicious nature I might wonder why you were in such  haste to make certain these two were never put to the question."
814,Jaime,Osney,All we done was what the queen commanded.On my word  as your Sworn Brother.
815,Baelor,Osfryd,"Elsewise, stay out of my sight, ser."
816,Addam,Brienne,"Look under every bed, you  know how fond my brother is of brothels."
817,Arthur,Jaime,"All knights must bleed, Jaime,Blood is the seal of our devotion."
818,Chett,Jacelyn,Cersei.
819,Chett,Stannis,What hour is it?The hour of the wolf.
820,Kevan,Stannis,"The drowned wolf,  perhaps."
821,Kevan,Stannis,"Do you remember the first time I came to you like  this?It was some dismal inn off Weasel Alley, and I put on servants garb to get past Fathers  guards.I remember.It was Eel Alley."
822,Kevan,Stannis,"Why are you here, at this hour?What would you have of me?"
823,Kevan,Stannis,Speak softly.
824,Kevan,Stannis,"Jaime, Kevan has  refused me."
825,Kevan,Stannis,He said as much.Refused?
826,Kevan,Stannis,How could he know?   she reminded him.
827,Mace,Tyrion,He may know as well.
828,Mace,Tyrion,You must be Tommens Hand.
829,Jaime,Tyrion,"   she pleaded, But our son...Tommen is no son of mine, no more than Joffrey was."
830,Jaime,Tyrion,You made them  Roberts too.
831,Jaime,Tyrion,You swore that you would always love me.It is not loving to make me  beg.
832,Jaime,Tywin,"No,I cannot.Will not.I need you.I need my other half."
833,Jaime,Tywin,"You are me, I am you."
834,Jaime,Tywin,Please.
835,Cersei,Tywin,"I was made for a battlefield, not a council chamber.And now it may  be that I am unfit even for that."
836,Cersei,Tywin,"Very well.If it is battlefields you want,  battlefields I shall give you."
837,Cersei,Jaime,I was a fool to come.I was a fool  ever to love you.
838,Jaime,Osmund,... shes been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know...
839,Tommen,Tywin,"Pray,"
840,Cersei,Tommen,Stop that!
841,Jaime,Tommen,"Ser Osmund, relieve me,"
842,Jaime,Tommen,"Im sorry,I will do better on the  morrow.Mother says a king must show the way, but the smell made me sick."
843,Jaime,Tommen,"Best we go outside, Your Grace."
844,Jaime,Vargo,"I wasnt scared,The smell made me sick."
845,Jaime,Vargo,"How  could you bear it, Uncle, ser?"
846,Jaime,Vargo,"A man  can bear most anything, if he must,"
847,Aerys,Tommen,"The world is full of horrors, Tommen.You can fight them,  or laugh at them, or look without seeing... go away inside."
848,Cersei,Tommen,"I... he confessed,   "
849,Cersei,Tommen,Your  brothers name was Joffrey.He would never have shamed me so.I never meant to.
850,Cersei,Jaime,  I have a nose too.
851,Cersei,Jaime,Lord Tyrell has a nose.
852,Cersei,Jaime,Did you see  Lady Margaery bawling like a baby?
853,Jaime,Tommen,"Cersei, enough."
854,Jaime,Tommen,Ser?
855,Jaime,Tommen,"You swore to stand vigil over Father until the  wake was done, as I recall.It is done.Go look at him.No."
856,Jaime,Tommen,"Take the number of your fingers, then add two.Cersei,  keep your voice down,Lord Tyrell is approaching."
857,Cersei,Mace,"His  Grace is not unwell, I hope?The king was overwhelmed by grief,As are we all."
858,Cersei,Jaime,"There is much and more you can do for Tommen, my lord,Perhaps  you would do Her Grace the honor of supping with her, after the evening services?"
859,Cersei,Jaime,Sup?
860,Cersei,Tommen,"I suppose... of course, we should be honored.My lady wife  and I."
861,Addam,Jaime,"Are you  drunk or dreaming, ser?Pray tell, why am I having supper with that grasping fool and his puerile  wife?"
862,Jaime,Tommen,"I will not name him Hand, if thats what...You need Tyrell,"
863,Cersei,Jaime,"Either way, you win.Storms End?"
864,Cersei,Jaime,"Yes, but... Lord Tyrell has made it tediously plain  that he will not leave Kings Landing till Tommen marries Margaery."
865,Jaime,Tommen,Then let them wed.
866,Jaime,Tommen,Give Tyrell his  wedding and send him off to play at war.
867,Cersei,Jaime,"Even sieges have their dangers,Why, our Lord of Highgarden might even lose his life in such a venture.There is that risk,Especially if his patience runs thin this time, and he  elects to storm the gate."
868,Cersei,Jaime,"You know,for a moment you sounded quite like  Father."
869,Brienne,Sansa,"Goodwife,"
870,Brienne,Sansa,"She may be riding with a drunken knight.Then shes no maid, Ill wager."
871,Brienne,Sansa,"No name?Well, the roads are full of nameless girls.The lichyards even fuller,"
872,Brienne,Shadrich,"Halt, you!"
873,Brienne,Shadrich,"State your purpose here.I seek the Lord of Duskendale, or his maester."
874,Brienne,Shadrich,The black bat of Lothston.Those are arms of ill  repute.They are not mine.I mean to have the shield repainted.Aye?
875,Brienne,Shadrich,"My sister does such work, as it happens.Youll  find her at the house with the painted doors, across from the Seven Swords."
876,Brienne,Shadrich,"Let her pass, lads.Its a wench."
877,Brienne,Chett,"Your door is very pretty,What castle is that meant to be?All castles,The only one I know is the Dun Fort by the harbor."
878,Brienne,Chett,"I never seen a dragon neither, nor a  griffin, nor a unicorn."
879,Brienne,Chett,"My old ma used to say that giant bats flew out from Harrenhal on moonless  nights, to carry bad children to Mad Danelle for her cookpots.Sometimes Id hear them  scrabbling at the shutters."
880,Brienne,Chett,What goes in its place?
881,Brienne,Chett,Your door  reminded me of an old shield I once saw in my fathers armory.
882,Brienne,Chett,"I can paint it straightaway, but the paint will need to dry."
883,Brienne,Chett,Ill bring the shield to you by morning.
884,Brienne,Denys,Do any Darklyns remain in Duskendale?
885,Brienne,Denys,"Well, theres Darkes, Im one myself.My husband says I was Darke before we wed, and  darker afterward."
886,Brienne,Denys,"Cant throw a stone in Duskendale without you hit some Darke  or Darkwood or Dargood, but the lordly Darklyns are all gone."
887,Denys,Harren,"Your Grace, the chamber pot needs emptying,  and fetch in some fresh faggots, Your Bloody Grace, the fires going out."
888,Harren,Jaime,"Well, there you are.Is that water hot enough for you?It will serve."
889,Harren,Jaime,"Id bring up more, but itd just slop over.A girl the size o you, you fill a tub."
890,Brienne,Renly,"I would speak with your lord,"
891,Brienne,Renly,"Best shout out loud, then.Lord Rykker rode to Maidenpool with Randyll Tarly,He left Ser Rufus Leek  as castellan, to look after Lady Rykker and the young ones."
892,Brienne,Tywin,"You will forgive me if I do not rise,"
893,Brienne,Tywin,How often must I sing  this song?
894,Brienne,Tywin,Did you think you were the first to come  seeking after Dontos?
895,Brienne,Tywin,"And what do you have, pray?"
896,Brienne,Tommen,It seems in order.
897,Brienne,Tommen,I never knew Ser Dontos.
898,Aerys,Hero,You know of that?A little.
899,Aerys,Denys,"In Duskendale they love Lord Denys still, despite the woe he brought them."
900,Aerys,Brienne,"Lord Tywin had sufficient strength to storm the  town any time he wished, but Lord Denys sent word that at the first sign of assault hed kill the  king."
901,Brienne,Denys,"The king was rescued,Barristan the Bold  brought him out.He did,Once Lord Denys lost his hostage, he opened his gates and ended  his defiance rather than let Lord Tywin take the town."
902,Denys,Jon,"Half of Duskendale will still tell you that Aerys was too kind to her.And the Hollards?Attainted and destroyed,I was forging my chain at the Citadel when this  happened, but I have read the accounts of their trials and punishments."
903,Dontos,Steffon,"As with the Darklyns, House Hollard was extinguished.Save for Dontos.True enough."
904,Dontos,Sansa,Look elsewhere.
905,Dontos,Sansa,I hear my ravens calling.You will forgive me  if I bid you good morrow.
906,Brella,Sansa,"I served with Lord Renly before mlady Sansa, and both turned traitor,No lord will touch me now, so I have to wash for whores."
907,Brienne,Sansa,Thats where her gods are.
908,Brienne,Lysa,What  would you be wanting?I was looking for the Seven Swords.Back the way you come.  
909,Brienne,Chett,"Pardons,"
910,Brienne,Chett,Are you hurt?
911,Brienne,Chett,Do I  know you?
912,Brienne,Chett,No.
913,Addam,Cersei, He scrambled to his feet.
914,Brienne,Chett,At my feet.
915,Brienne,Chett,"Mlady, here, have my  place."
916,Brienne,Chett,"Keep your seat,I can stand as well as you.Aye, but my head is not so apt to knock upon the ceiling."
917,Brienne,Chett,Cant the Father see through hair?
918,Brienne,Chett,"Do you serve some holy house in Duskendale, brother?Twas nearer Maidenpool, mlady, but the wolves burned us out,We rebuilt as best we could, until some sellswords come."
919,Brienne,Dontos,"When that was done I dug up a few coins the elder brother had hid by and set off by  myself.I met some other brothers going to Kings Landing.Aye, theres hundreds on the roads."
920,Brienne,Dontos,"The Smith, he made me small enough."
921,Brienne,Dontos,"And  whats your sad tale, mlady?I am looking for my sister."
922,Brienne,Dontos,Theres  gold for the man who helps me find her.Gold?
923,Brienne,Dontos,"A bowl of that crab stew would be enough reward  for me, but I fear I cannot help you.Fools Ive met, and plenty, but not so many pretty maids."
924,Brienne,Dontos,"There was a fool at Maidenpool, now that I think of  it.He was clad in rags and dirt, as near as I could tell, but under the dirt was motley."
925,Brienne,Sansa,"Did this fool have a red nose, full of broken veins?I could not swear to that."
926,Dontos,Sansa,"Later, I encountered him again, at the Stinking Goose.The Stinking Goose?"
927,Dontos,Sansa,"An unsavory place,Lord Tarlys men patrol the port at Maidenpool, but  the Goose is always full of sailors, and sailors have been known to smuggle men aboard their  ships, if the price is right."
928,Dontos,Sansa,"Sometimes he would sing a funny song.Seeking passage for three?Not two?Three, mlady.That Id swear to, by the Seven."
929,Dontos,Sansa,"Did the fool find his ship?That I could not say,but one night some of Lord Tarlys soldiers visited  the Goose looking for him, and a few days later I heard another man boasting that hed fooled a  fool and had the gold to prove it. she said."
930,Brienne,Tyrion,"I fear thats all that I can offer you, aside from a small mans prayers."
931,Cleos,Jaime,"You should eat more,A woman big as you needs t keep her strength up.It is not far  to Maidenpool, but the road is perilous these days."
932,Jaime,Shagwell,Mlady?
933,Jaime,Shagwell,Are you thinking of your sister?
934,Jaime,Shagwell,"The Crone will light your way to her, never fear.The Maiden will keep her safe.I pray that you are right.I am."
935,Brienne,Jaime,But now I must be on my way.Ive a long way yet to go to reach Kings  Landing.Do you have a horse?A mule?Two mules.
936,Brienne,Jaime,"There they are, at the bottom of my legs.They get me  where I want t go."
937,Jaime,Randyll,"Six Maids in a Pool,"
938,Brienne,Tywin,"Murdered by  his own son, they say,that vile little  dwarf.And the king is just a boy,Who is to rule us till he comes  of age?Lord Tywins brother,Or that Lord Tyrell, might be.Or the Kingslayer.Not him,Not that oathbreaker."
939,Jaime,Renly,"You did beautifully,"
940,Brienne,Catelyn,"I have no sons but Robb,"
941,Brienne,Catelyn,"Sansa was a little lady,"
942,Arya,Sansa,"She had auburn hair, thick  and soft... the red in it would shine like copper in the light of the torches."
943,Brienne,Shadrich,Have you seen a maid of three-and-ten along the  road?
944,Brienne,Shadrich,A highborn maid with blue eyes and auburn hair?
945,Brienne,Shadrich,She may have been traveling with a fool.
946,Cersei,Qyburn,I will not have my lady wife  cavorting about in mans mail.
947,Jaime,Shadrich,"Men  will always underestimate you,and their pride will make them want to vanquish you  quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried them sorely."
948,Brienne,Podrick,Who are you?
949,Brienne,Podrick,"Puh,Puh."
950,Brienne,Podrick,Puh.Puh.Please?
951,Brienne,Podrick,Are you saying please?
952,Brienne,Podrick,"Please tell me who you are, and why youre following me.Not puh-puh-please."
953,Brienne,Podrick,Puh-puh-Pod.
954,Brienne,Podrick,Puh-Payne.
955,Brienne,Ronnet,Why are you following me?
956,Brienne,Ronnet,"Were you told to spy upon me?Do  you belong to Varys, or the queen?No."
957,Brienne,Ronnet,No one.
958,Brienne,Tyrion,This road is too dangerous for a boy  alone.Not for a squire.
959,Brienne,Tyrion,The Hands squire.Lord Tywin?
960,Brienne,Tyrion,No.
961,Brienne,Tyrion,Halfman!
962,Brella,Sansa,Why are you stalking after me?
963,Brella,Sansa,What do you want?To find her.
964,Brella,Sansa,His lady.
965,Edmure,Emmon," His face twisted in sudden  anguish. he repeated, as the rain ran down his face, "
966,Eddard,Sansa,"The man has played us every song he knows thrice over,I cannot keep him here against his will."
967,Eddard,Sansa,"I promise you, other singers will come."
968,Harren,Petyr,"Please,cant you  make him stop?I gave the man my word, sweetling."
969,Lysa,Sansa,Id sooner suffer his singing than listen to his sobbing.
970,Petyr,Robert,"   That cannot be helped, the wench is dead."
971,Petyr,Sansa,It will not be  much longer.Lord Nestor is making his ascent on the morrow.
972,Jon,Lysa,"He wont... you wont let Lord Nestor see Marillion, will you?"
973,Lysa,Petyr,On the contrary.I  shall insist on it.
974,Petyr,Sansa,"We have come to an agreement,  Marillion and I. Mord can be most persuasive."
975,Petyr,Sansa,Whom do you imagine Lord Nestor  will believe?Us?
976,Petyr,Sansa,Of course.Our lies will profit him.
977,Petyr,Sansa,"Yes, but... but  what if...What if Lord Nestor values honor more than profit?"
978,Petyr,Sansa,"What if it  is truth he wants, and justice for his murdered lady?"
979,Petyr,Sansa,"I know Lord Nestor, sweetling.Do you imagine Id ever let him harm my daughter?"
980,Lysa,Nestor,"Couldnt you tell Lord Nestor that I am... indisposed,  or...He will want to hear your account of Lysas death.My lord, if... if Marillion tells what truly...If he lies, you mean?Lies?  "
981,Blue,Petyr,Nestor will be  moved.
982,Blue,Petyr,You have your mothers  eyes.
983,Blue,Sansa,"When you are a little older, many a man  will drown in those eyes."
984,Petyr,Robert,"All you need do is tell Lord Nestor the same tale that you told Lord Robert,"
985,Petyr,Robert,"Some lies are love,"
986,Petyr,Sansa,"When we lied to Lord Robert, that was just to spare  him,And this lie may spare us.Else you and I must leave the Eyrie by the same door Lysa used."
987,Petyr,Sansa,"We shall serve him lies and Arbor gold, and hell drink them  down and ask for more, I promise you."
988,Petyr,Sansa,"Ravings,My wife was mad, you saw that for yourself."
989,Petyr,Sansa,"The Day They Hanged Black Robin,The Mothers Tears,The Rains of Castamere."
990,Petyr,Sansa,"Six Sorrows,Fallen Leaves,Alysanne."
991,Joffrey,Sansa,AlysanneOn a Misty  Morn
992,Daenerys,Reznak,
993,Colemon,Nestor,"Lord Nestor, you will recall Alayne, my natural daughter?To be sure."
994,Petyr,Sansa,"Sweetling, be a good girl and bring Lord Robert to the High Hall to receive his guests.Yes, Father."
995,Nestor,Sansa,"Gretchel, fetch me the washbasin."
996,Nestor,Sansa,Did my Sweetrobin sleep well last night?No.
997,Nestor,Sansa,"I never slept one bit, Alayne."
998,Robert,Sansa,Someone locked me in my room.That was wicked of them.
999,Robert,Sansa,I was going to come sleep with you.
1000,Robert,Sansa,Lord Nestor Royce has come up from the Gates to see you.
1001,Robert,Sansa,"I dont want to see him,I want a story.A story of the Winged Knight.After,First you must see Lord Nestor.Lord Nestor has a mole,"
1002,Robert,Sansa,Mommy  said he was dreadful.My poor Sweetrobin.
1003,Petyr,Sansa,"You miss her, I know."
1004,Petyr,Sansa,He loved her just as you do.
1005,Petyr,Robert,"There,you look a proper lord now."
1006,Marwyn,Robert,Marillion hurt my mother.He threw her out the Moon Door.Did your lordship see this happen?
1007,Lothor,Nestor,"Alayne saw it,And my lord stepfather."
1008,Moon,Petyr,"Forgive her, my lords,She still has nightmares of that day.Small  wonder if she cannot bear to speak of it."
1009,Lysa,Petyr,"I know how hard this is for you, Alayne, but our friends must hear the truth.Yes."
1010,Lysa,Petyr,I saw...
1011,Lysa,Robert,... when Marillion... pushed  her.
1012,Lothor,Robert,He  killed my mother.I want him to fly!
1013,Colemon,Lothor,Fly!
1014,Colemon,Lothor,"Fly,  fly."
1015,Colemon,Petyr,"Best take his lordship  back to bed and bleed him,"
1016,Nestor,Petyr,"I misliked that singer  from the first,I urged Lady Lysa to send him away.Many a time I urged her.You always gave her good counsel, my lord,She took no heed of it,She heard me grudgingly and took no heed.My lady was too trusting for this world."
1017,Petyr,Sansa,"Lysa could not see the evil in men, only the good.Marillion sang  sweet songs, and she mistook that for his nature.He called us pigs,"
1018,Marwyn,Nestor,"He made a song about two pigs snuffling round a  mountain, eating a falcons leavings."
1019,Marwyn,Nestor,"Why, ser, tis a song about some pigs, he said.He made mock of me as well,Ser Ding-Dong, he named me.When I vowed Id cut his tongue out, he ran to Lady Lysa and hid behind her skirts.As oft he did,The man was craven, but the favor Lady Lysa showed him  made him insolent.She dressed him like a lord, gave him gold rings and a moonstone belt.Even Lord Jons favorite falcon."
1020,Lysa,Petyr,His lordship loved that bird.King Robert gave it to him.
1021,Lysa,Petyr,"It was unseemly,"
1022,Lysa,Sansa,"I should have been with her, but I never  dreamt... if I had not insisted... it was I who killed her."
1023,Petyr,Sansa,"No, my lord, you must not blame yourself,This was the singers work,Bring him up, Lord Petyr.Let us write an end  to this sorry business.As you wish, my lord."
1024,Lysa,Nestor,"Good lords, I beg your forgiveness."
1025,Lysa,Nestor,You confess your crime?If I had eyes I should weep.
1026,Lysa,Nestor,"I loved her so, I could not bear to see her in anothers arms, to know she shared  his bed."
1027,Eddard,Tommen,
1028,Lysa,Maddy,"Lord Petyr has been kind enough to let me keep my harp,My harp  and... my tongue... so I may sing my songs.   Lord Nestor growled. said Petyr."
1029,Marillion,Sansa,No more mouth.
1030,Petyr,Sansa,"The man must die,He should have  followed Lady Lysa out the Moon Door.Without his tongue,Without that lying, mocking tongue.I have been too gentle with him, I know,If truth be  told, I pity him.He killed for love.For love or hate,he must die.Soon enough,No man lingers long in the sky cells.The blue will  call to him.It may,but whether Marillion will answer, only he can say."
1031,Nestor,Petyr,"Sers, I know you must be weary  after your ascent."
1032,Nestor,Sansa,"Oswell, show them the way, and see that they have all they need."
1033,Nestor,Sansa,"My lord, will you join me in the solar for a cup of wine?Alayne,  sweetling, come pour for us."
1034,Petyr,Sansa,"This will not be the end of it,My cousin means to question the singer himself.Bronze Yohn mistrusts me."
1035,Symon,Symond,He means to come in force.
1036,Symon,Symond,"And Lady  Waynwood too, I fear.And Lord Belmore, Young Lord Hunter, Horton Redfort.They will bring Strong SamwellStone,  the Tolletts, the Shetts, the Coldwaters, some Corbrays.You are well-informed."
1037,Nestor,Petyr,"Not Lord Lyonel?No, his brother.Ser Lyn mislikes me, for some reason.Lyn Corbray is a dangerous man,What do you intend to do?What can I do but make them welcome if they come?"
1038,Nestor,Petyr,"My cousin means to remove you as Lord Protector.If so, I cannot stop him."
1039,Nestor,Petyr,Lord Royce and his friends can raise  twenty thousand.
1040,Nestor,Petyr,"Bronze Yohn will  do what he will do,"
1041,Nestor,Sansa,My lord.This is a token of the love my lady bore you.
1042,Nestor,Sansa,"This... this is unexpected, my lord."
1043,Nestor,Sansa,"Unexpected, but not undeserved."
1044,Jon,Nestor,"You  were her rock, she told me.Her rock."
1045,Jon,Nestor,"She said that?Often....Petyr gestured at the parchment...Jon Arryn valued my service, I know, but Lady Lysa... she  scorned me when I came to court her, and I feared...It bears  the Arryn seal, I see, but the signature...Lysa was murdered before the document could be presented for her signature, so I signed as  Lord Protector."
1046,Lysa,Nestor,"You are... dutiful, my lord."
1047,Nestor,Petyr,"Some would say the Gates were as royal as the Eyrie.There has been no king in the Vale for three hundred years,The dragons came,But even after, the Gates remained an Arryn castle."
1048,Jon,Nestor,"After his ascent, he named his  brother Ronnel to the honor, and later his cousin Denys.Lord Robert has no brothers, and only distant cousins.True."
1049,Jon,Nestor,I will not say I had not hoped for this.
1050,Jon,Nestor,"But by the gods, I earned this!You did,and Lord Robert sleeps more easily knowing that you are always there,  a staunch friend at the foot of his mountain."
1051,Jon,Nestor,"So... a toast, my lord.To House  Royce, Keepers of the Gates of the Moon... now and forever.Now and forever, aye!"
1052,Nestor,Petyr,You see the wonders that can be worked with lies and  Arbor gold?
1053,Lysa,Nestor,Were they all  lies?Not all.
1054,Nestor,Sansa,"She knew Lord Nestor dreamed of holding the Gates in  his own right, a lord in truth as well as name, but Lysa dreamed of other sons and meant the  castle to go to Roberts little brother."
1055,Nestor,Sansa,"Do you understand what happened here,  Alayne?"
1056,Nestor,Sansa,"You gave Lord Nestor the Gates of the Moon to be certain of his  support.I did,"
1057,Nestor,Yohn,Men of honor will do things for their  children that they would never consider doing for themselves.
1058,Nestor,Yohn,"The signature... you might have had Lord Robert put his hand and seal to it, but  instead..."
1059,Nestor,Yohn,"Why?So... if you are removed, or... or killed..."
1060,Nestor,Petyr,Though no more than Id expect of mine own  daughter.Thank you.
1061,Nestor,Petyr,"Im not,  though."
1062,Cersei,Meryn,  Petyr put a finger to her lips.
1063,Dontos,Marillion,"Do you want  more blood on your pretty little hands, my darling?"
1064,Dontos,Sansa,"No,Please.I am tempted to say this is no game we play, daughter, but of course it is.The game of  thrones."
1065,Lothor,Oswell,"Oswell... my lord,  Oswell rowed me from Kings Landing the night that I escaped.He must know who I am.If hes half as clever as a sheep pellet, you would think so."
1066,Eddard,Oswell,"You are Alayne, and you must be Alayne all the time."
1067,Eddard,Petyr,Even here.
1068,Eddard,Petyr,Can you be my daughter in  your heart?I...
1069,Gretchel,Petyr,"I am Alayne, Father.Who else would I be?"
1070,Gretchel,Petyr,"With my wits and Cats beauty, the world will be yours,  sweetling.Now off to bed."
1071,Lothor,Robert,Sweetrobin?
1072,Lothor,Robert,"Just close your eyes and  sleep, little one.I will."
1073,Asha,Lothor,"Alayne?Are you my mother  now?I suppose I am,"
1074,Asha,Qarl,"They  have not come,or not enough of them."
1075,Asha,Rodrik,"My uncle is with his books?Aye, where else?"
1076,Asha,Rodrik,"With the books, and Botley.He was  with him too."
1077,Asha,Harren,"I had heard my nuncle Crows Eye had  old Sawane Botley drowned.Lord Tristifer Botley, this one is."
1078,Balon,Harren,"And my lady mother?Abed,in the Widows Tower."
1079,Balon,Rodrik,"I will only stay until my grief has passed,though by rights Ten Towers should be mine, for I am seven years your elder."
1080,Asha,Theon,Did you bring my baby boy?
1081,Asha,Theon,"Theon could not come,Father  sent him reaving along the Stony Shore."
1082,Asha,Rodrik,"I must speak with Lord Rodrik,See to my crew, once theyre done  unloading Black Wind."
1083,Asha,Rodrik,"I want them to have warm beds and a hot meal.Theres cold beef in the kitchens.And mustard in a big stone jar, from Oldtown."
1084,Asha,Rodrik,That will not serve.
1085,Asha,Rodrik,I want something hot in their bellies.
1086,Asha,Rodrik,Lady Glover and the children should  not want for wood nor warmth.
1087,Asha,Chett,The babe is sick.Babes are often sick.
1088,Asha,Chett,I shall ask my lord where to put these wolf  folk.
1089,Asha,Chett,"You will do as I  say.And if this babe dies, no one will be sorrier than you."
1090,Marwyn,Rodrik,Nuncle.
1091,Marwyn,Rodrik,What reading was so urgent that you leave your  guests without a host?Archmaester Marwyns Book of Lost Books.
1092,Marwyn,Rodrik,Hotho brought me a copy from Oldtown. Lord  Rodrik tapped the book with a long nail.
1093,Asha,Marwyn,Does Lanny know that you are here?Not as yet.
1094,Asha,Rodrik,Let her  rest.
1095,Asha,Rodrik,Three-Tooth seems to have  lost two more of her teeth.Do you call her One-Tooth now?I seldom call her at all.
1096,Asha,Rodrik,What hour is it?
1097,Asha,Rodrik,"Dark, so soon?"
1098,Asha,Rodrik,"We looked for  you some days ago.The winds were against us, and I had captives to concern me."
1099,Maegor,Rodrik,Deepwood is important to my plans.Your plans must change.You come too late.Late and hungry.
1100,Maegor,Rodrik,"Oh, and  thirsty too.A horn of ale would go down well, Nuncle."
1101,Asha,Rodrik,You know I do not permit food nor drink in my library.  
1102,Asha,Rodrik,"You do like to provoke me.Oh, dont look so aggrieved."
1103,Asha,Rodrik,You are well?
1104,Asha,Rodrik,Well enough.
1105,Asha,Rodrik,I have sent to Myr for a lens to help me  read.And how fares my aunt?
1106,Asha,Rodrik,"Still seven years my elder, and convinced Ten Towers should be hers."
1107,Asha,Rodrik,"She mourns for her dead husband as  deeply as she did the day he died, though she cannot always recall his name.I am not certain she ever knew his name."
1108,Asha,Rodrik,Was  my father murdered?So your mother believes.
1109,Asha,Rodrik,"And what  does my nuncle believe?Balon fell to his death when a rope bridge broke beneath him.A storm was rising, and the  bridge was swaying and twisting with each gust of wind."
1110,Asha,Rodrik,Or so we are told.Your mother had a bird from Maester Wendamyr.
1111,Asha,Balon,"Three years away, and the Crows Eye returns the very day my father dies.The day after, we had heard."
1112,Asha,Balon,"Even so, I will agree that Eurons return was... timely, shall we say?That is not how I would say it."
1113,Asha,Balon,"Where are  my ships?I counted twoscore longships moored below, not near enough to throw the Crows Eye  off my fathers chair.I sent the summons."
1114,Asha,Rodrik,  
1115,Asha,Rodrik,"Where are the ships from Saltcliffe, from Orkwood, from the Wyks?Baelor Blacktyde came from Blacktyde to consult with me, and just as soon set sail again."
1116,Asha,Rodrik,He is on Old Wyk by now.Old Wyk?
1117,Asha,Rodrik,Why Old Wyk?I thought you would have heard.Aeron Damphair has called a kingsmoot.
1118,Asha,Rodrik,The Drowned God must have shoved a pricklefish up  Uncle Aerons arse.
1119,Asha,Rodrik,"Is this some jape, or does he mean it truly?The Damphair has not japed since he was drowned."
1120,Asha,Rodrik,The captains are gathering on Old  Wyk as we speak.
1121,Asha,Rodrik,"Has the Crows Eye agreed to attend this holy farce and abide by its  decision?The Crows Eye does not confide in me.Since he summoned me to Pyke to do him homage, I  have had no word from Euron."
1122,Asha,Rodrik,And my uncle Victarion?What does he make of the Damphairs notion?Victarion was sent word of your fathers death.
1123,Asha,Rodrik,"Beyond that, I cannot say."
1124,Asha,Rodrik,I believe Ill kiss the Damphairs smelly feet and pluck the  seaweed from out between his toes.
1125,Asha,Rodrik,"A bloody kingsmoot!On Old Wyk,Though I pray it is not bloody."
1126,Euron,Rodrik,"House Greyiron ruled unchosen for a thousand years from that dark day, until the Andals came.You must lend me Haeregs book, Nuncle."
1127,Asha,Euron,You may read it here.It is old and fragile.
1128,Asha,Euron,"Archmaester Rigney  once wrote that history is a wheel, for the nature of man is fundamentally unchanging."
1129,Asha,Euron,Nor should you.
1130,Asha,Euron,"And miss the first kingsmoot called in... how long has it been, Nuncle?Four thousand years, if Haereg can be believed."
1131,Asha,Tywin,"Let us take one side or  the other, help them to victory with our fleets, and claim the lands we need from a grateful king.That might be worth some thought, once I sit the Seastone Chair,"
1132,Asha,Tywin,"You will not want to hear this, Asha, but you will not be chosen."
1133,Balon,Rodrik,"And you  have three uncles.Four.Three kraken uncles.I do not count.You do with me.So long as I have my nuncle of Ten Towers, I have Harlaw."
1134,Rodrik,Victarion,"My cousins do me fealty, and in war I should command their swords and sails. Lord Rodrik shook his head."
1135,Rodrik,Victarion,Your fight is hopeless.No fight is hopeless till it has been fought.
1136,Aegon,Victarion,I am the heir of Balons  body.You are still a willful child.
1137,Aegon,Balon,"I will put a torch to Black Wind if need be, to keep you here.What, and make me swim to Old Wyk?A long cold swim, for a crown you cannot keep."
1138,Asha,Balon,The Old Way died  with Black Harren and his sons.I know that.
1139,Asha,Balon,"Does that mean we must live and die as thralls to  the Iron Throne?If there are rocks to starboard and a storm to port, a wise captain steers a third  course.Show me this third course.I shall... at my queensmoot."
1140,Balon,Rodrik,"  Dead history is writ in ink, the living sort in blood.Do you want to die old and craven in your bed?How else?Though not till Im done reading."
1141,Balon,Rodrik,You have not  asked about your lady mother.
1142,Balon,Rodrik,How is she?Stronger.
1143,Asha,Rodrik,"She eats more than she did when she first came here, and oft sleeps through the night.Good."
1144,Asha,Rodrik,Maron?
1145,Asha,Rodrik,"Rodrik, where are  you?Theon, my baby, come to Mother."
1146,Asha,Rodrik,I will see her in the morning.She will ask for word of Theon.
1147,Asha,Rodrik,What have you told her?Little and less.There was naught to tell.
1148,Asha,Rodrik,You are certain that he is dead?I am certain of nothing.You found a body?We found parts of many bodies.
1149,Asha,Rodrik,It seemed as  though the northmen fought amongst themselves.Crows will fight over a dead mans flesh and kill each other for his eyes.
1150,Asha,Rodrik,"We had one king, then five.Now  all I see are crows, squabbling over the corpse of Westeros."
1151,Asha,Rodrik,"Do not go  to Old Wyk, Asha."
1152,Asha,Rodrik,"We shall not have her long, I fear."
1153,Asha,Rodrik,"My mother raised me to be bold.If I do not go, I will spend the rest of  my life wondering what might have happened if I had.If you do go, the rest of your life may be too short for wondering.Better that than fill the remainder of my days complaining that the Seastone Chair by rights  was mine.I am no Gwynesse."
1154,Asha,Sigfryd,"Asha, my two tall sons fed the crabs of Fair Isle."
1155,Hot,Sigfryd,Be content with that.Ten Towers?
1156,Hot,Sigfryd,Your cousins will not like that.  
1157,Asha,Rodrik,"Boremund has three sons,  Sigfryd Silverhair has grandsons, and Hotho has ambitions,They all mean to follow  you, even Sigfryd.That one intends to live forever.The Knight will be the Lord of Harlaw after me,but he can rule from Grey  Garden as easily as from here."
1158,Asha,Rodrik,"Asha, of House Greyjoy."
1159,Asha,Rodrik,"Its my fathers seat I want, not yours."
1160,Asha,Rodrik,"No, Ill sit the Seastone Chair.Then you are just another crow, screaming for carrion."
1161,Asha,Rodrik,Go.I wish to return to Archmaester Marwyn and his search.Let me know if he should find another page.
1162,Chett,Tristifer,Asha?
1163,Asha,Tristifer,"Tris.Id thought to find you in the hall.I wanted to see you.What part of me, I wonder?"
1164,Asha,Tristifer,"Well, here I stand, all grown up.Look all you  like.A woman."
1165,Asha,Tristifer,And beautiful.
1166,Asha,Balon,"I was sorry to hear about your father,I grieve for yours."
1167,Baelor,Harren,"Is it true you are Lord Botley now?In name, at least."
1168,Asha,Harren,Lord Wynch was the first man to bend his knee and call him king.
1169,Asha,Harren,"Wynch  never had your fathers courage.Your uncle bought him,The Silence returned with holds full of treasure."
1170,Asha,Eddard,"My uncle Germund calls himself  Lord Botley now, and rules in Lordsport as your uncles man.You are the rightful Lord Botley,Once I hold the Seastone Chair, your  fathers lands shall be restored.If you like."
1171,Asha,Eddard,"A woman grown  now, but I remember when you were a skinny girl with a face all full of pimples."
1172,Asha,Eddard,I remember that as well.
1173,Asha,Tristifer,"I dont want to have a dozen sons,I want to have adventures."
1174,Jon,Tristifer,"I wrote you letters,but Maester Joseran would not send them."
1175,Jon,Lucas,"Aeron  Damphair has called a kingsmoot.Will you come and speak for me?I will go anywhere with you, but... Lord Blacktyde says this kingsmoot is a dangerous folly.He thinks your uncle will descend on them and kill them all, as Urron did."
1176,Jon,Lucas,He lacks the strength.You do not know his strength.
1177,Asha,Rodrik,  
1178,Asha,Rodrik,"The sons of salt wives, the grandsons of  thralls.The Codds... do you know their words?Though All Men Do Despise Us,"
1179,Asha,Rodrik,"The Crows Eye brought  back monsters from the east... aye, and wizards too.Nuncle always had a fondness for freaks and fools,My father used to fight with  him about it."
1180,Asha,Rodrik,"Will I have your voice at the queensmoot, Tris?You shall have all of me."
1181,Asha,Rodrik,Your lady mother  has given her consent.
1182,Asha,Rodrik,"I am no second son now,I am the rightful Lord Botley, as you said yourself.  "
1183,Asha,Chett,"You think you want to wed me, but you dont.I do."
1184,Asha,Chett,"Asha, I swear upon the bones of Nagga, I have never touched  another woman.Go touch one... or two, or ten."
1185,Asha,Chett,"Some with my lips,  more with my axe."
1186,Asha,Chett,fuck
1187,Asha,Tristifer,You...
1188,Daenerys,Reznak, He rubbed his mouth.
1189,Asha,Tristifer,"If we wed, soon enough youd come to hate me.Never.Asha, I have ached for you."
1190,Asha,Tristifer,"Find a  brothel, Tris.Theyll cure you of that ache.I could never...You and I were meant to be, Asha.I have always  known you would be my wife, and the mother of my sons."
1191,Asha,Tristifer,Take your hand away or you wont live long enough to  breed a son.Now.
1192,Asha,Tristifer,"You want a woman, well and good."
1193,Asha,Tristifer,Remember that.
1194,Nute,Victarion, Jocelyn Swyft said as  she laced up the queens gown.
1195,Balon,Nute,Tighter.
1196,Jaime,Senelle,"Take this away and bring me hot spiced wine,"
1197,Boros,Tommen,"I will have men in the kitchens watching as each  dish is prepared,Ser Addams gold cloaks will escort the servants as they bring the  food to table, to make certain no tampering takes place along the way."
1198,Jaime,Melara,"Tommen will be safe, I promise you.Safe."
1199,Jaime,Melara,Tyrion will not kill the same way twice.
1200,Jaime,Tommen,"He could be under the  floor even now, listening to every word we say and making plans to open Tommens throat.Suppose he was,Whatever plans he makes, he will still be small and stunted."
1201,Cersei,Tommen,The Kingsguard will protect  him.
1202,Cersei,Tommen,"I remember how well they guarded Joffrey, these splendid knights of yours.I want you  to remain with Tommen all night, is that understood?I will have a guardsman outside his door."
1203,Cersei,Tommen,Not a guardsman.
1204,Cersei,Tommen,And inside his bedchamber.In case Tyrion crawls out of the hearth?He wont.So you say.Will you tell me that you found all the hidden tunnels in these walls?
1205,Cersei,Tommen,"I will not have Tommen alone with Margaery, not for so much as half a heartbeat.They will not be alone.Her cousins will be with them.As will you.I command it, in the kings name."
1206,Alerie,Tommen,"Husband and wife should sleep together,even if they do no more than sleep."
1207,Alerie,Margaery,Let the children warm each other in  the night.
1208,Cersei,Margaery,"They sing  and play games and whisper secrets to each other when the candles are snuffed out.How delightful,Let them continue, by all means.In the Maidenvault.I am sure Her Grace knows best,She is the boys own  mother, after all, of that we are all sure."
1209,Alerie,Olenna,"It is ill luck for their  marriage if they do.ill luck,Margaery may  share Tommens bedchamber for that one night,No longer.Your Grace is so gracious,"
1210,Cersei,Jaime,"I need eyes inside  that room,To see what?"
1211,Cersei,Jaime,"There can be no danger of a consummation.Tommen is much too  young.And Ossifer Plumm was much too dead, but that did not stop him fathering a child, did it?"
1212,Jaime,Robert,Who was Ossifer Plumm?
1213,Jaime,Robert,who?
1214,Cersei,Robert,"Forget Plumm, just  remember what I told you.Swear to me that you will stay by Tommens side until the sun comes  up.As you command,Do you still mean to go ahead  and burn the Tower of the Hand?After the feast."
1215,Cersei,Jaime,Our lord father was murdered in that tower.
1216,Cersei,Jaime,"If the gods are  good, the fire may smoke a few rats from the rubble."
1217,Cersei,Jaime,"Tyrion, you mean.Him, and Lord Varys, and this gaoler.If any of them were hiding in the tower, we would have found them."
1218,Cersei,Jaime,Weve knocked through walls and ripped up floors and  uncovered half a hundred secret passages.And for all you know there may be half a hundred more.
1219,Cersei,Jaime,The  Imp is small and cunning.
1220,Cersei,Jaime,"If he is, the fire will smoke him out.Even if Tyrion were still hiding in the castle, he wont be in the Tower of the Hand.Weve  reduced it to a shell.Would that we could do the same to the rest of this foul castle,After the war I  mean to build a new palace beyond the river."
1221,Jaime,Tommen,This city is a cesspit.For half a groat I would move the court to  Lannisport and rule the realm from Casterly Rock.That would be an even greater folly than burning the Tower of the Hand.
1222,Jaime,Tommen,"Hide him under the Rock and he  becomes just another claimant to the throne, no different than Stannis.I am aware of that,I said that I wanted to move the court to  Lannisport, not that I would.Were you always this slow, or did losing a hand make you stupid?"
1223,Jaime,Tommen,"If these flames spread beyond the tower, you may end up burning down the  castle whether you mean to or not.Wildfire is treacherous.Lord Hallyne has assured me that his pyromancers can control the fire."
1224,Jaime,Tommen,Let all of Kings Landing see the  flames.It will be a lesson to our enemies.Now you sound like Aerys.
1225,Jaime,Tommen,"Guard your tongue, ser.I love you too, sweet sister."
1226,Cersei,Joffrey,"It was the cloak my lord  father used when he wed my lady mother,That old thing?"
1227,Robert,Stannis,"It looks a bit threadbare to  me... and dare I say, unlucky?"
1228,Robert,Stannis,"In my day a bride donned her husbands colors, not his lady mothers."
1229,Cersei,Lyle,"Westeros has two queens now, and the young one is as beautiful as the old  one,"
1230,Kevan,Vargo,"I understand you mean to leave us for another  wedding,Hardstone has cleared the broken men from Darry castle,Lancels bride awaits  us there.Will your lady wife be joining you for the nuptials?The riverlands are still too dangerous."
1231,Beric,Vargo,Is it true that Sandor Clegane has joined him?
1232,Beric,Vargo,Some say.Reports are confused.
1233,Cersei,Kevan,"No doubt Lancel will be eager to hunt down Clegane and Lord Beric both, to  restore the kings peace to the riverlands."
1234,Cersei,Kevan,My son is not the man to deal with Sandor  Clegane.
1235,Cersei,Kevan,His father might be.
1236,Cersei,Kevan,If my service is not required at the Rock...
1237,Jaime,Kevan,"Bring us Sandors head, and I know His Grace will be most grateful.Joffrey may  have liked the man, but Tommen was always afraid of him... with good reason, it would seem.When a dog goes bad, the fault lies with his master,"
1238,Margaery,Small,"I blame you for all  this,Let them wed, you said."
1239,Cersei,Jaime,   Jaime broke in quietly.
1240,Cersei,Jaime,"Shes leaving,Mace is taking half the Tyrell strength to Storms End, and the  other half will be going back to the Reach with Ser Garlan to make good his claim on  Brightwater.A few more days, and the only roses left in Kings Landing will be Margaery and  her ladies and a few guardsmen.And Ser Loras.Or have you forgotten your Sworn Brother?Ser Loras is a knight of the Kingsguard.Ser Loras is so Tyrell he pisses rosewater.He should never have been given a white cloak.He would not have been my choice, Ill grant you."
1241,Loras,Margaery,"Once a man puts on that cloak, it changes him.It certainly changed you, and not for the better.I love you too, sweet sister."
1242,Cersei,Margaery,"Your Grace,I feel  as though I have a second mother now. said Margaery."
1243,Blue,Olenna,"What a disappointment,I was hoping for  The Rains of Castamere."
1244,Mace,Paxter,To the king and  queen!
1245,Mace,Paxter,The king and queen!
1246,Mace,Paxter,The king and queen!
1247,Cersei,Paxter,To both our queens!
1248,Cersei,Paxter,To the young queen and the old!
1249,Margaery,Tommen,"Only a little wine that went down the wrong way,"
1250,Cersei,Tommen,"My little love needs to take smaller  sips.See, you scared your lady mother half to death.Im sorry, Mother,"
1251,Mag,Meryn,Your Grace?
1252,Mag,Meryn,Do I intrude?
1253,Cersei,Orton,"The Small Hall is so stuffy,The smoke was making my eyes water.And mine, Your Grace."
1254,Cersei,Margaery,I have a son as well.I know that I shall weep rivers on the day he  weds.
1255,Cersei,Margaery,"My thanks,Your Grace, I...There is something you must know."
1256,Cersei,Margaery,She tells Lady Margaery everything you do.Senelle?
1257,Elinor,Margaery,You  are certain of this?Have her followed.
1258,Cersei,Margaery,"Put your own man in the  gallery on the morrow, and he will see Senelle whispering to Megga beneath the altar of the  Maiden.If this is true, why tell me?"
1259,Cersei,Margaery,Why would you betray  her?
1260,Cersei,Margaery,"Longtable may be sworn to Highgarden,but I am of Myr, and my loyalty is to my husband and my son."
1261,Cersei,Joffrey,"I shall look into this,If what you say is  true, you will be rewarded."
1262,Joffrey,Small,Your Grace is kind.And beautiful.
1263,Mace,Small,"It was only  a gulp of wine that went down the wrong way.Though it startled me as well.My belly is such a knot that I cannot eat,The wine tastes of bile.This  wedding was a mistake.This wedding was necessary.The boy is safe.Fool.No one who wears a crown is ever safe."
1264,Jaime,Margaery,Would Your Grace honor her white knight with a  dance?
1265,Cersei,Jaime,And have you fumbling at me with that stump?
1266,Cersei,Mace,If you think you can manage it without spilling.A cripple like me?Not likely.
1267,Jaime,Senelle,"I think Her Grace has had enough wine for one night,"
1268,Jaime,Small,"Lords and  ladies,if you will be so good as to come outside with me, we shall  light a candle to celebrate the union of Highgarden and Casterly Rock, and a new age of peace  and plenty for our Seven Kingdoms."
1269,Cersei,Hallyne,Lord  Hallyne!You may commence.Hmmmmmm
1270,Hallyne,Tyrion,"The substance,"
1271,Hizdahr,Reznak,"Look, the flames are  dancing."
1272,Margaery,Olenna,"Mother, look, theyre dancing.I see them.Lord Hallyne, how long will the fires burn?All night, Your Grace.It makes a pretty candle, I grant you,Bright enough to see us safe to sleep, I think."
1273,Cersei,Jaime,It is time the king and queen were put to  bed.Yes.
1274,Cersei,Jaime,"Lord Commander, escort His Grace and his little queen to  their pillows, if you would.As you command.And you as well?No need."
1275,Jaime,Osmund,The flames are so pretty.I want to watch them for a  while.
1276,Jaime,Osmund,You should not stay alone.I will not be alone.
1277,Cersei,Osmund,"Your Sworn Brother.If it please Your Grace,It does."
1278,Doran,Trystane,"I am sorry I could not  see you until now, or meet Princess Myrcella,but I trust that my daughter Arianne has made you welcome here in Dorne, ser.She has, my prince,Ours is a harsh land, and poor, yet not without its beauties."
1279,Chett,Doran,"Half my lords agree with them, I fear.And you, my prince?"
1280,Chett,Doran,My mother taught me long ago that only madmen fight wars they cannot win.
1281,Chett,Doran,Yet this peace is fragile... as fragile  as your princess.Only a beast would harm a little girl.My sister Elia had a little girl as well.
1282,Chett,Doran,She was a princess too.
1283,Chett,Doran,"Those who would plunge a knife into Princess Myrcella do not bear her any  malice, no more than Ser Amory Lorch did when he killed Rhaenys, if indeed he did."
1284,Chett,Doran,"For if Myrcella should be slain in Dorne whilst under my protection, who  would believe my denials?No one shall ever harm Myrcella whilst I live.A noble vow,"
1285,Chett,Doran,Every night I hear them whispering and sharpening  their knives.
1286,Chett,Doran,"My apologies, ser,I am frail and failing, and sometimes... Sunspear  wearies me, with its noise and dirt and smells."
1287,Chett,Doran,When I do I shall take Princess Myrcella with me.
1288,Doran,Myrcella,You shall go as well.
1289,Doran,Myrcella,She will not be lonely.As you say.
1290,Chett,Jacelyn,My lady?
1291,Chett,Jacelyn,Where are you?Here.
1292,Chett,Jacelyn,"Touch me, ser,"
1293,Chett,Jacelyn,"Yes, there,"
1294,Chett,Jacelyn,"More, oh more, yes, sweet, my knight, my knight, my sweet white knight, yes you,  you, I want you."
1295,Chett,Jacelyn,"Deeper,Yes, oh."
1296,Chett,Jacelyn,"There is wine,"
1297,Chett,Jacelyn,Are you  thirsty?No.
1298,Chett,Jacelyn,"You bleed,I scratched too hard."
1299,Chett,Jacelyn,Dont.
1300,Chett,Jacelyn,No more.I have balm.For the scratches.
1301,Chett,Jacelyn,The scratches are nothing.  
1302,Chett,Jacelyn,"Stay with  me tonight, ser.I still have much to teach you.I have learned too much from you already.You seemed glad enough for the lessons at the time, ser."
1303,Chett,Jacelyn,"I will fight her for you, bare-breasted,  knife to knife."
1304,Chett,Jacelyn,Unless she is a Sand Snake.
1305,Chett,Jacelyn,I love my  cousins well.You know I have no other woman.
1306,Chett,Jacelyn,duty.
1307,Chett,Jacelyn,That  poxy bitch?
1308,Chett,Jacelyn,"Let  duty sleep alone for once, and stay with me tonight.My place is at the palace."
1309,Chett,Jacelyn,With your other princess.
1310,Chett,Jacelyn,"You need a woman, not a little girl, but I can play  the innocent if that excites you.You should not say such things."
1311,Chett,Jacelyn,I love Myrcella as a daughter.
1312,Chett,Jacelyn,"We are going to the Water Gardens.Eventually,"
1313,Chett,Jacelyn,And where is the brave young  gallant who said he wished to spend the rest of his life in my arms?I was drunk when I said that.Youd had three cups of watered wine.I was drunk on you.
1314,Chett,Jacelyn,"I am afraid.What would frighten my white knight?I fear for my honor,and for yours.I can tend to my own honor."
1315,Chett,Jacelyn,"And to my own pleasures, if need be.I am a woman grown."
1316,Chett,Jacelyn,"Your hands are shaking,They would sooner be caressing me, I think."
1317,Chett,Jacelyn,"I would sooner be flesh and blood than silks and jewels, and you... you are not  your white cloak, ser.I am,I am my cloak."
1318,Chett,Jacelyn,  
1319,Chett,Jacelyn,Do you know what my father did when he  learned of it?
1320,Chett,Jacelyn,Nothing.
1321,Chett,Jacelyn,"Tell me  true, ser, is it my dishonor that concerns you, or your own?Both."
1322,Chett,Jacelyn,That is why this must be our last time.So you have said before.
1323,Chett,Jacelyn,"This is ruined,How can I wear it now?Backwards,Once you don your robes, no one will see the tear."
1324,Chett,Jacelyn,Or shall I send a new one to the Water Gardens?Send me no gifts.
1325,Boros,Chett,All I want is to  end this... this...
1326,Boros,Chett,I begin to think that all your words of love were lies.
1327,Boros,Chett,"Why else would I have forsaken  all my honor, but for love?"
1328,Boros,Chett,"  If you love me, do not leave me.I swore a vow...... not to wed or father children."
1329,Boros,Chett,"Though I might be persuaded to keep you for my paramour.Now you mock me.Perhaps a little.Do you think you are the only Kingsguard who ever loved a woman?There have always been men who found it easier to speak vows than to keep them,"
1330,Boros,Chett,"Ser Terrence Toyne was found abed with his   kings mistress,Twas love, he swore, but it cost his life and hers, and brought  about the downfall of his House and the death of the noblest knight who ever lived.Yes, and what of Lucamore the Lusty, with his three wives and sixteen children?The song  always makes me laugh.The truth is not so funny."
1331,Chett,Lewyn,  
1332,Chett,Lewyn,"The  noblest knight who ever lived, you said, and he took his queen to bed and got her with child.I will not believe that,The tale of Prince Aemons treason with Queen  Naerys was only that, a tale, a lie his brother told when he wished to set his trueborn son aside in  favor of his bastard.Aegon was not called the Unworthy without cause."
1333,Joffrey,Lewyn,"I will not  be remembered as Ser Arys the Unworthy,I will not soil my cloak.Yes,"
1334,Joffrey,Lewyn,"He was as tall as a tower and used to tickle me  until I could not breathe for laughing.I never had the honor to know Prince Lewyn,but all agree that he was a great  knight.A great knight with a paramour.She is an old woman now, but she was a rare beauty in her  youth, men say."
1335,Joffrey,Lewyn,"My uncle always said that it was the sword in a mans hand that determined his worth, not the  one between his legs,so spare me all your pious talk of soiled cloaks."
1336,Joffrey,Lewyn,"Robert was no monster.He climbed onto his throne over the corpses of children,though I will grant you he  was no Joffrey."
1337,Myrcella,Tyrion,"Joffrey is dead, poisoned by the Imp."
1338,Myrcella,Tommen,"Tommen is king now, and he is not his  brother.Nor is he his sister."
1339,Arianne,Myrcella,I will not say that you are wrong.
1340,Arianne,Myrcella,Will not?
1341,Arianne,Myrcella,  
1342,Arianne,Myrcella,Should I give up my rights to my  brothers?You twist my words.
1343,Arianne,Myrcella,"The Seven Kingdoms have never had a  ruling queen.The first Viserys intended his daughter Rhaenyra to follow him, do you deny it?But as the  king lay dying the Lord Commander of his Kingsguard decided that it should be otherwise."
1344,Aegon,Hot,"The Kingmaker  wrought grave harm,and gravely did he pay for it, but...... but perhaps the Seven sent you here so that one white knight might make right what another  set awry."
1345,Hot,Myrcella,"Prince Oberyn Viper would have  placed the crown upon her head himself if he had lived, but my father lacks the courage."
1346,Hot,Myrcella,"You say you love the girl as you would a daughter of your own blood.Would  you let your daughter be despoiled of her rights and locked away in prison?The Water Gardens are no prison,A prison does not have fountains and fig trees, is that what you think?"
1347,Hot,Myrcella,He is terrible when aroused.
1348,Myrcella,Renly,What would you have me  do?No more than you have sworn.
1349,Myrcella,Renly,"Set a crown upon her head.I swore an oath!To Joffrey, not to Tommen.Aye, but Tommen is a good-hearted boy.He will be a better king than Joffrey.But not better than Myrcella."
1350,Renly,Stannis,He will be  as great a lord as any in the realm... but Myrcella by rights should sit the Iron Throne.The law...  
1351,Barristan,Joffrey,"Aegon the Dragon made the Kingsguard and its vows, but what one king does another can  undo, or change."
1352,Arianne,Myrcella,She will give us leave to marry if we ask.
1353,Arianne,Myrcella,"You can have me and your  white cloak both, if that is what you want."
1354,Arianne,Myrcella,"You know I do, but...I am a princess of Dorne,and it is not meet that you should  make me beg."
1355,Arianne,Myrcella,Arianne?
1356,Arianne,Myrcella,"What is it, my love?Must I say it, ser?"
1357,Chett,Myrcella,Is it so wrong of me to want a knight to keep me safe?
1358,Myrcella,Tyene,"No,but you have your fathers guards  to keep you safe, why...It is my fathers guards I fear."
1359,Myrcella,Tyene,It was my  fathers guards who dragged my sweet cousins off in chains.Not in chains.I have heard that they have every comfort.
1360,Myrcella,Tyene,"Have you seen them?He will not permit me to see them, did you  know that?They were speaking treason, fomenting war..."
1361,Alys,Tyene,"If she can be imprisoned, so can I, and for the same cause... this of  Myrcella.Your father would never do that.You do not know my father."
1362,Alys,Myles,"He never commanded me to wed them, I grant you, but the offers  alone prove how little he regards me.Even so, you are his heir.Am I?He left you to rule in Sunspear when he took himself off to his Water Gardens, did he not?To rule?"
1363,Myles,Oberyn,"Our laws constrain him, but he would sooner have my brother  follow him, I know it.Your brother?"
1364,Oberyn,Quentyn,"You cannot mean Trystane, he is just a boy.Not Trys.Quentyn."
1365,Arianne,Quentyn,"I have known the truth  since I was four-and-ten, since the day that I went to my fathers solar to give him a good night  kiss, and found him gone."
1366,Arianne,Quentyn,"My father told Quentyn that he must do all that his maester  and his master-at-arms required of him, because one day you will sit where I sit and rule all  Dorne, and a ruler must be strong of mind and body."
1367,Arianne,Quentyn,"My fathers words, written in his own hand."
1368,Arianne,Quentyn,"I cried  myself to sleep that night, and many nights thereafter."
1369,Arianne,Quentyn,"Perhaps you misunderstood,You were only a child.Perhaps the prince was only saying that to encourage your brother to be more diligent.You think so?Then tell me, where is Quentyn now?The prince is with Lord Yronwoods host in the Boneway,"
1370,Arianne,Chett,"So my father wishes us to believe, but I have friends who tell me  otherwise."
1371,Arianne,Chett,Why?How would I know?There could be a hundred reasons.Or one.Are you aware that the Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr?Sellswords break their contracts all the time.Not the Golden Company.
1372,Anders,Arianne,"Why break a contract that offered  them the prospect of good wages and good plunder?Perhaps Lys offered them better wages.Or Tyrosh.No,I would believe it of any of the other free companies, yes."
1373,Anders,Chett,His forebears rode with Bittersteel during three of the  Blackfyre Rebellions.
1374,Anders,Chett,Have you ever seen the arms of House Toland of Ghost Hill?
1375,Anders,Chett,A dragon eating its own tail?The dragon is time.
1376,Anders,Chett,"He whispers in my brothers ear that he should rule after my  father, that it is not right for men to kneel to women... that Arianne especially is unfit to rule,  being the willful wanton that she is."
1377,Anders,Chett,"So your two princesses share  a common cause, ser... and they share as well a knight who claims to love them both, but will not  fight for them.I will."
1378,Anders,Chett,"Myrcella is the elder, and better suited to the crown."
1379,Anders,Brienne,What would you have of me?All.
1380,Brienne,Cleos,"All, my love, my true love, my sweet love, and forever.  "
1381,Jaime,Podrick,My lady?Ser?
1382,Jaime,Podrick,What are you looking for?
1383,Jaime,Podrick,A wall I rode by once.It does not matter.
1384,Brienne,Jaime,"Stay quiet, Podrick.There may still be  outlaws in these woods."
1385,Brienne,Jaime,I have a  longsword.I can fight.
1386,Podrick,Tywin,"The boys who guard the foodstuffs always eat the best,"
1387,Brienne,Podrick,"You  may call yourself a squire,"
1388,Brienne,Podrick,"You dont want  that.I do,I want that."
1389,Brienne,Podrick,My lady.
1390,Podrick,Sansa,ser.
1391,Brienne,Podrick,Ser?My lady?
1392,Brienne,Podrick,Theres a cart ahead.
1393,Brienne,Podrick,"Slowly now,They may take us for outlaws.Say no more than you  must and be courteous.I will, ser."
1394,Brienne,Podrick,My lady.
1395,Brienne,Podrick,"We used to have an ox,but the wolves made off with him."
1396,Brienne,Chett,"They took off our daughter too and had their way with her, but she come  wandering back after the battle down at Duskendale."
1397,Brienne,Chett,"The wolves ate him, I  expect."
1398,Brienne,Chett,"Maidenpool was all in ruins  when last I saw it,The gates were broken and half the town was burned.They rebuilt it some."
1399,Chett,Randyll,Tarly hunted down the worst o them and  shortened them with that big sword o his.
1400,Chett,Randyll,Youve seen no  outlaws on the road?None.
1401,Brienne,Randyll,"Be wary, woman."
1402,Brienne,Randyll,"Sandor has crossed the Trident with a hundred outlaws, and its said  theyre raping every wench they come upon and cutting off their teats for trophies."
1403,Daenerys,Reznak,
1404,Brienne,Randyll,Not so long as  Lord Tarly has the rule there.
1405,Randyll,Renly,"The town will be restored  to Lord Mooton once the fightings done,His lordship has been pardoned  by the king.Pardoned?"
1406,Brienne,Renly,For what?
1407,Brienne,Dick,Ser Myles was bold as brass till that Robert killed him.
1408,Brienne,Dick,"I am looking for my sister, a fair maid of three-and-ten.Perhaps  youve seen her?Ive not seen no maids, fair nor foul."
1409,Brienne,Dick,"Mootons daughter, shes a maid,Till the bedding, anyways."
1410,Brienne,Dick,The cooks will need eggs for cakes.They will.
1411,Brienne,Chett,Whats this now?Eggs?
1412,Brienne,Chett,Well take them.
1413,Brienne,Chett,Our eggs is for Lord Mooton.For the wedding cakes and such.Have your hens lay more.
1414,Brienne,Chett,"Here, dont say you werent  paid."
1415,Brienne,Chett,"Thats not enough,Not near enough.I say it is,For them eggs, and you as well."
1416,Brienne,Chett,Shes too  young for that old man.
1417,Brienne,Chett,Release her.
1418,Brienne,Chett,"This is none of your concern,You mind your mouth, wench."
1419,Brienne,Chett,"Well now,"
1420,Brienne,Chett,You know what  Lord Tarly does with outlaws?
1421,Brienne,Chett,"I know what Lord Randyll does with outlaws,I know what he does with rapers  too."
1422,Brienne,Chett,"What was it  you was saying, wench?   a deeper voice finished."
1423,Brienne,Hyle,And he cuts fingers off thieves.
1424,Hyle,Renly,"Ser Hyle,Best let her by, lads,This is Brienne the Beauty, the Maid of Tarth,  who slew King Renly and half his Rainbow Guard."
1425,Hyle,Renly,Her father is the Evenstar of Tarth.
1426,Hyle,Renly,"Shouldnt we seize her, ser?"
1427,Brienne,Renly,For killing Renly?Why?
1428,Brienne,Renly,"So were we all, rebels to a man, but now were Tommens loyal  lads."
1429,Brienne,Renly,His lordships steward will be pleased  to see those eggs.Youll find him in the market.
1430,Brienne,Renly,"My thanks, mlord."
1431,Brienne,Podrick,"Come, wife."
1432,Hyle,Podrick,"That rounsey may be the most hideous horse Ive ever seen,I am surprised that youre not riding it, my lady.Do you plan to thank me for my help?"
1433,Brienne,Hyle,"One day Ill thank  you in a mêlée, ser.The way you thanked Red Ronnet?"
1434,Hyle,Renly,Shouldnt you be watching your gate?
1435,Hyle,Renly,My cousin Alyn is off hunting outlaws.
1436,Emmon,Renly,What is it that youre looking for?A stable.Over by the east gate.This one burned.
1437,Emmon,Renly,What you said to those men...
1438,Emmon,Renly,I swear it on my sword.
1439,Emmon,Robar,"Aye, and it was the Knight of Flowers who carved up the Rainbow Guard."
1440,Hyle,Robar,"What quest brings the Maid to Maidenpool, I  wonder?"
1441,Brienne,Hyle,"Theres a man I seek, at a place called the Stinking Goose.I thought Brienne the Beauty had no use for men."
1442,Brienne,Hyle,The  Stinking Goose.
1443,Brienne,Hyle,First you will  come with me to see his lordship.
1444,Hyle,Randyll,"Am I to be arrested?What, for Renly?"
1445,Hyle,Randyll,"No one  cares, no one remembers."
1446,Hyle,Randyll,"This way, if you please."
1447,Hyle,Randyll,"I would thank you not to touch me.Thanks at last,"
1448,Brienne,Chett,"The soldiers are rebuilding the town,They would sooner be dicing, drinking, and fucking, I dont doubt, but Lord Randyll believes  in putting idle men to work."
1449,Brienne,Jaime,"I never  hurt no one, mlord,I only took what the septons left when they run  off.If you got to take my finger for that, do it.It is customary to take a finger from a thief,but a man  who steals from a sept is stealing from the gods."
1450,Brienne,Jaime,Seven  fingers.Leave his thumbs.Seven?
1451,Brienne,Podrick,"Wash out her private parts with lye  and throw her in a dungeon,"
1452,Brienne,Hyle,"If it please mlord, this bastid put his dagger through  my hand.He said I was cheating him at dice."
1453,Brienne,Hyle,"Were you?No, mlord.I never.For theft, I will take a finger."
1454,Brienne,Hyle,Shall I ask to see these dice?The dice?
1455,Brienne,Hyle,"Might be I... them dice, theyre lucky for me, s true, but I...Take his little finger."
1456,Brienne,Hyle,A nail through the  palm for the other.
1457,Brienne,Hyle,"Were done.March the rest of them back to the dungeon, Ill deal  with them on the morrow."
1458,Brienne,Hyle,"My lord,"
1459,Brienne,Hyle,My lady.
1460,Brienne,Hyle,honor?I have been sent to look for... for...How will you find him if you do not know his name?Did you slay Lord Renly?No.
1461,Brienne,Hyle,"No,you  only let him die."
1462,Brienne,Hyle,It was sorcery.  
1463,Brienne,Hyle,Aye.
1464,Brienne,Hop,"By all the gods, I ought to ship you back to Tarth.Do that and answer to the throne."
1465,Hop,Randyll,Podrick.
1466,Hop,Randyll,Bring it to his lordship.
1467,Hop,Randyll,The kings business.What sort of business?
1468,Hop,Randyll,"S-sansa Stark.If the Stark girl were here, Id know it."
1469,Hop,Randyll,"She had best hope she chooses the right one.She might have gone to the Vale instead,to her mothers  sister."
1470,Petyr,Randyll,Lady Lysa is dead.
1471,Hyle,Petyr,The lords of the Vale are not  the sort to bend their knees to some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers.
1472,Hyle,Lysa,Go where you want and do as you will... but when youre raped  dont look to me for justice.You will have earned it with your folly.
1473,Hyle,Lysa,"And you, ser, should be at your gate.I gave you the command there, did I not?You did, my lord,but I thought...You think too much."
1474,Catelyn,Hyle,"You spoke of the Stinking Goose, my lady,If you want me to show you...Go back to your gate."
1475,Brienne,Hyle,If thats your  wish.It is.It was only a game to pass the time.We meant no harm.
1476,Brienne,Hyle,"Ben died, you know."
1477,Brienne,Hyle,And Mark Mullendore took a  wound that cost him half his arm.
1478,Hyle,Podrick,"Podrick, come."
1479,Hyle,Podrick,Are we going to find the place?The Stinking  Goose?I am.
1480,Hyle,Podrick,"Ask the stableman if theres an inn where  we can spend the night.I will, ser.My lady."
1481,Hyle,Podrick,Do you know where it is?
1482,Hyle,Podrick,"The Stinking Goose, I mean.No.He said hed show us."
1483,Hyle,Podrick,Ser Kyle.Hyle.Hyle.
1484,Hyle,Podrick,"I mean, my lady."
1485,Hyle,Podrick,"At Highgarden, when King Renly called  his banners, some men played a game with me."
1486,Brienne,Hyle,"It was a cruel game,  hurtful and unchivalrous."
1487,Brienne,Hyle,"The east gate is that way.Wait for me there.As you say, my lady.Ser."
1488,Brienne,Sansa,I am looking for  a man called Nimble Dick.Dick Crabb.Comes in most every night.
1489,Brienne,Sansa,"If  youre going to cut him, do it somewheres else.We dont want no trouble with Lord Tarly.I want to talk with him.Why would I do him harm?"
1490,Brienne,Sansa,If you would nod when he comes in Id be thankful.How thankful?
1491,Brienne,Owen,as sweet as the maids of Tarth.
1492,Hyle,Randyll,"I have put an end to their sport,Some of these... challengers... are less  honorable than others, and the stakes were growing larger every day.It was only a matter of time  before one of them decided to claim the prize by force.They were knights,anointed knights.And honorable men.The blame is yours."
1493,Brienne,Randyll,"I would never... my lord, I did nought to encourage them.Your being here encouraged them."
1494,Brienne,Randyll,"If you have any regard for  your virtue or the honor of your House, you will take off that mail, return home, and beg your  father to find a husband for you.I came to fight,To be a knight.The gods made men to fight, and women to bear children,A womans  war is in the birthing bed."
1495,Brienne,Randyll,"Wine,and  none o your horse piss in it, thanke."
1496,Brienne,Robert,"Ill buy your wine,for a word."
1497,Brienne,Robert,A word?I know a lot o words.
1498,Brienne,Robert,"Tell me which mlady wants t hear, and Nimble Dick will say it.I heard you fooled a fool."
1499,Brienne,Robert,Mighten be I did.Or not.
1500,Arya,Robert,Who is it wants t know?King Robert.
1501,Arya,Robert,Does he now?
1502,Arya,Robert,"I like to see a king dance, hey- nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-ho.Mighten be I saw this fool of yours.Was there a girl with him?Two girls,Two girls?"
1503,Arya,Robert,"Well,I never seen the little sweets, mind you, but he was wanting passage for  three.Passage where?Tother side o the sea, as I recall.Do you remember what he looked like?A fool."
1504,Arya,Robert,A  frightened fool.Frightened why?
1505,Arya,Robert,"He never said, but old Nimble Dick knows the smell o fear."
1506,Arya,Brienne,"Only one night some  men come in with that hunter on their teats, and your fool went white as milk and got quiet till  they left."
1507,Arya,Brienne,"That Tarlys got soldiers crawling over the docks,  watching every ship that comes or goes."
1508,Arya,Brienne,"So I offered him some help.What sort of help?The sort that costs more than one silver stag.Tell me, and youll have another.Lets see it,"
1509,Arya,Brienne,A  man who cant go t the ships need for the ships t come t him.
1510,Brienne,Chett,"A hidden place, like."
1511,Brienne,Chett,A smugglers cove.You sent the fool to smugglers.Him and them two girls.
1512,Brienne,Chett,"Only thing, well, the place I sent them, been no ships  there for a while.Thirty years, say."
1513,Brienne,Chett,"Whats this fool to you?Those two girls are my sisters.Are they, now?"
1514,Brienne,Chett,Last I saw her she was off  for Kings Landing t make a living on her back.Where did you send them?
1515,Brienne,Chett,"As t that, I cant recall.Where?"
1516,Brienne,Chett,Someplace no stag ever found... though a  dragon might.
1517,Brienne,Chett,Where?
1518,Brienne,Chett,Sweet.
1519,Brienne,Chett,"Dick  Crabb, Im named, though most call me Nimble Dick."
1520,Brienne,Chett,"Where in Crackclaw Point?The Whispers.You heard o Clarence Crabb, o course.No."
1521,Brienne,Chett,"Ser Clarence Crabb, I said."
1522,Chett,Jacelyn,"No  horse could bear his weight, so he rode an aurochs.What does he have to do with this smugglers cove?His wife was a woods witch."
1523,Brienne,Chett,"A lonely place, the Whispers."
1524,Brienne,Chett,"One dragon by hisself gets lonely.  Do you take me for a fool?No, but I can take you to one."
1525,Brienne,Dick,"Take you to the  Whispers, mlady."
1526,Cersei,Margaery,
1527,Brienne,Dick,Nothing if nothing is what we find.
1528,Brienne,Dick,Six is good.Six will serve.
1529,Brienne,Dick,Do not play me false.Youll not find me easy meat.
1530,Brienne,Dick,"Bloody piss,You hurt my hand.I am sorry for that."
1531,Dick,Samwell,  
1532,Dick,Samwell,I need t see this man about a horse.
1533,Dareon,Samwell,"I have a queasy belly,With a belly big as yours, Slayer, that is a lot of quease."
1534,Craster,Samwell,"Gods be good,"
1535,Gilly,Samwell,"This  is a good ship,You dont have to be afraid."
1536,Dareon,Samwell,"Looking for mermaids, Slayer?"
1537,Dareon,Samwell,No.
1538,Gilly,Samwell,"This ship will take us as far as Braavos,Well find another ship to carry us to Oldtown."
1539,Gilly,Samwell,"If we do, we can go and see a mummer show, and  have some oysters."
1540,Gilly,Samwell,"If you want, mlord.What do you want?"
1541,Gilly,Samwell,Nothing.
1542,Aemon,Cotter,"There have been storms,Winter storms are worse, but autumns are more frequent."
1543,Dareon,Samwell,"The Day They Hanged Black Robin,The Mermaids Lament,Autumn of My Day,Iron LancesSeven Swords for Seven Sons,Miladys Supper,Her Little Flower,Meggett Was a Merry Maid, a  Merry Maid Was She.The Bear and the Maiden Fair,"
1544,Aemon,Alliser,"Honey  poured over thunder,"
1545,Aemon,Dareon,What is he looking at?
1546,Aemon,Dareon,For him its as  dark up here as it is down in the cabin.
1547,Aemon,Dareon,"I was not born blind,When last I passed this way, I  saw every rock and tree and whitecap, and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake."
1548,Brynden,Dareon,Later he was chosen lord commander.Bloodraven?
1549,Brynden,Dareon,I know a song about him.
1550,Brynden,Dareon,But I thought he lived a hundred years ago.We all did.Once I was as young as you.
1551,Randyll,Samwell,"The boy needs a bit of seasoning, thats all,Aye, a pinch of pepper, a few nice cloves, and an  apple in his mouth."
1552,Paxter,Samwell,"Horas was to come with us in your place, whilst you remained on the  Arbor as Lord Paxters page and cupbearer.If you had pleased him, you would have been  betrothed to his daughter."
1553,Dick,Samwell,My poor SamwellMy poor poor Samwell
1554,Dick,Samwell,"I am a  man now, Mother,a steward, and a man of the Nights Watch."
1555,Dick,Samwell,"See,see, I was good for something after all."
1556,Chett,Samwell,stone
1557,Dareon,Samwell,"If the gods are good, we may catch a glimpse of a  unicorn.If the captain is good, we wont come that close."
1558,Gilly,Samwell,Shes scared enough.Her and that squalling whelp of hers.
1559,Gilly,Samwell,"The only time he  ever stops crying is when she shoves a nipple in his mouth, and then she starts to sob."
1560,Dareon,Samwell,"Maybe the babe is hurting her,If his teeth are  coming in...Id heard that wildlings  were braver than that.She is brave,"
1561,Dareon,Samwell,"The sea scares her,  thats all,Before she came to the Wall, all she knew was Crasters Keep and  the woods around it."
1562,Dareon,Samwell,"She knows streams and rivers, but she had never seen a lake until we came on one, and  the sea... the sea is a scary thing.Weve never been out of sight of land.We will be."
1563,Dareon,Samwell,"Surely a little water does not frighten the Slayer.No,not me."
1564,Dareon,Samwell,Only if she shoves a plug up his arse.I cannot abide the  smell.
1565,Dareon,Samwell,"We had best go below, where its  dry,"
1566,Aemon,Samwell,It has been a long time  since last I wept.
1567,Aemon,Samwell,"We have to get below,"
1568,Aemon,Samwell,"Maester,Maester Aemon, wake up."
1569,Aemon,Samwell,Egg?
1570,Aemon,Samwell,"Egg, I dreamed that I was old."
1571,Gilly,Samwell,"Help me,Help me dry  him off and get him warm."
1572,Gilly,Samwell,"You get in  with him,Hold him."
1573,Gilly,Samwell,We have to warm him up.
1574,Gilly,Samwell,Wheres Dareon?Wed all be warmer if we were together.
1575,Gilly,Samwell,"Dont you be  frightened,This is just an adventure.One day youll tell your son this tale."
1576,Dareon,Samwell,"Too bloody close,One  good blow, and well be breaking up aside them."
1577,Dareon,Samwell,What does it matter?
1578,Aemon,Gilly,"It doesnt,"
1579,Gilly,Samwell,"Fucked her own father,Worse than whoring, that."
1580,Gilly,Samwell,"Well  all drown unless we get rid of her, and that abomination that she whelped."
1581,Dareon,Gilly,"Seven bloody hells,cant you even stop weeping long enough  to hear a song?Just play,just sing the song for her.She doesnt need a song,She needs a good spanking, or maybe a hard fuck.Get out of my way, Slayer."
1582,Aemon,Gilly,Isnt there something you can give her?
1583,Aemon,Samwell,"Some herb or  potion, so she wont be so afraid?It is not fear you hear,That is the sound of grief, and there is no potion  for that.Let her tears run their course, Samwell You cannot stem the flow."
1584,Aemon,Samwell,Shes going to a safe place.
1585,Aemon,Samwell,"Why should she be  grieving?Samwellyou have two good eyes, and yet you do not see."
1586,Aemon,Samwell,  
1587,Aemon,Gilly,That couldnt... she wouldnt... of  course hes hers.
1588,Aemon,Gilly,"She loves him.She nursed them both and loved them both,"
1589,Gilly,Jon,"What threats the Lord Commander made, what promises, I can only guess... but threats  and promises there surely were.No."
1590,Jon,Samwell,  
1591,Jon,Samwell,"Sometimes there is no happy choice, Samwell only one less  grievous than the others."
1592,Dareon,Gilly,Slayer.
1593,Dareon,Samwell,"A sweet night, for once."
1594,Dareon,Samwell,Might be the worst is done.No.
1595,Dareon,Samwell,"There,"
1596,Dareon,Tywin,"The worst isnt done.The worst is just beginning, and  there are no happy endings.Gods be good,Slayer, you are such a craven."
1597,Jaime,Kevan,"Lord Commander,Does Her Grace have some last command for  me?I am not here for Cersei."
1598,Jaime,Kevan,I came to make my farewells.He was my father.And hers.I am not Cersei.
1599,Jaime,Kevan,"Cersei has two.Both of you have a taste for mockery,Spare me your japes, ser, I have no  taste for them.As you will."
1600,Jaime,Kevan,"Cersei would have wanted to  see you off, but she has many pressing duties."
1601,Jaime,Kevan,So do we all.How fares your king?
1602,Jaime,Kevan,"Well enough,Balon Swann is with him during the mornings.A good  and valiant knight.Once that went without saying when men spoke of those who wore the white cloak."
1603,Cersei,Jaime,"Ser,you need to make your peace with Cersei.Are we at war?No one told me."
1604,Cersei,Jaime,"Strife between Lannister and Lannister can only help the enemies of our  House.If there is strife, it will not be my doing."
1605,Cersei,Lancel,"The castle must needs be  restored, the lands planted and protected."
1606,Cersei,Lancel,And your sister has  left me little else to occupy my time.I had as well see Lancel wed. His bride has grown  impatient waiting for us to make our way to Darry.
1607,Jaime,Sandor,"Will you remain at Darry  after the wedding?For a while, mayhaps."
1608,Jaime,Sandor,It may be that he has joined Dondarrion.
1609,Jaime,Sandor,Randyll Tarly is at Maidenpool.
1610,Jaime,Sandor,I  would sooner have you go to Riverrun.Ser Daven has command there.
1611,Jaime,Sandor,"Lancel does.As you say, uncle."
1612,Jaime,Kevan,You would do well to keep your knights around you.
1613,Jaime,Kevan,"Is that a threat, ser?"
1614,Jaime,Kevan,A caution.I only meant... Sandor is dangerous.I was hanging outlaws and robber knights when you were still shitting in your swaddling  clothes.
1615,Jaime,Kevan,Not every Lannister is a fool for glory.
1616,Jaime,Kevan,Addam Marbrand could deal with these  outlaws just as well as you.
1617,Jaime,Kevan,But none  would make a good Kings Hand.Your sister knows my terms.
1618,Jaime,Kevan,"Tell her that, the next time you are in her  bedchamber."
1619,Jaime,Kevan,Lancel.
1620,Jaime,Lancel,I only regret  that my duties do not permit me to attend.His Grace must be protected.And will be.
1621,Jaime,Lancel,Im sure my lady will be pleased to show you what goes where.
1622,Jaime,Lancel,"I know enough to do my  duty as a husband, ser.Thats just the thing a bride wants on her wedding night,A husband who knows  how to do his duty."
1623,Jaime,Lancel,"I pray for you, cousin."
1624,Jaime,Lancel,May  the Crone lead her to her wisdom and the Warrior defend her.Why would Cersei need the Warrior?She has me.
1625,Jaime,Pycelle,Did I miss  some clever jape?
1626,Jaime,Pycelle,"Oh, look,your brave brother has returned, Your Grace.Most of him."
1627,Pycelle,Robert,"Grand Maester,share the tidings with the Lord Commander, if you would."
1628,Bronn,Pycelle,"There has been a bird,From Stokeworth.Lady Tanda sends word that her daughter Lollys has been delivered of a strong, healthy son.And you will never guess what they have named the little bastard, brother.They wanted to name him Tywin, I recall.Yes, but I forbade it.I told Falyse that I would not have our fathers noble name bestowed  upon the ill-gotten spawn of some pig boy and a feeble-witted sow.Lady Stokeworth insists the childs name was not her doing,"
1629,Bronn,Pycelle,"Lollyss husband made the choice, she writes.   ventured Jaime."
1630,Bronn,Jaime,"There you are, sweet sister.You have been looking everywhere for  Tyrion, and all the time hes been hiding in Lollyss womb.Droll."
1631,Bronn,Jaime,"No doubt the bastard is sucking on one of Lollys  Lackwits dugs even as we speak, whilst this sellsword looks on, smirking at his little insolence.Perhaps this child bears some resemblance to your brother,He might have been born deformed, or without a nose."
1632,Bronn,Cersei,"We shall have to send the darling boy a gift,Wont we, Tommen?We could send him a kitten.A lion cub,"
1633,Cersei,Jaime,"I had a different sort of gift in mind,"
1634,Jaime,Jon,"Youre hurting me,Youre  hurting me."
1635,Jaime,Jon,"We are  sworn to protect her as well,We are,but not from him."
1636,Jaime,Tommen,"Your Grace,might we have a private word?As you wish."
1637,Jaime,Tommen,"Go with the Grand  Maester.Yes, Mother.We are learning about Baelor the Blessed."
1638,Jaime,Tommen,"Shall I return for  supper, Your Grace?I shall be very cross with you if you do not."
1639,Daenerys,Reznak,"First these  Kettleblacks, then Qyburn, now her. Jaime reminded her."
1640,Cersei,Jaime,Margaery was thrilled  when I asked her leave to take Taena on as my companion.
1641,Cersei,Taena,"Our little queen does not want me to be lonely.If you know she is a spy, why take her on?Margaery is not half so clever as she thinks."
1642,Cersei,Taena,Some of it is even  true.
1643,Cersei,Taena,"And Taena tells me everything Maid Margaery  is doing.Does she?How much do you know about this woman?I know she is a mother, with a young son that she wants to rise high in this world."
1644,Cersei,Margaery,You would be surprised at all the interesting things shes told me.What sorts of things?
1645,Cersei,Margaery,Did you know that the Queen of Thorns keeps a chest of coins  in her wheelhouse?
1646,Kevan,Stannis,What merchant would dare complain of being cheated by Mace Tyrells lady  mother?Did you enjoy your little ride?Our uncle remarked upon your absence.Our uncles remarks do not concern me.They should.
1647,Kevan,Roose,"  He will deal with Stannis.Lord Bolton is trapped below the Neck, cut off from the north by the ironmen at Moat Cailin.Not for long."
1648,Aenys,Hosteen,That should be more than enough to deal with Stannis and a few thousand broken men.Ser Kevan...
1649,Jaime,Lancel,Daven and Damion will serve us better.Theyll suffice.
1650,Jaime,Taena,"You still require a Hand, however.If  not our uncle, who?"
1651,Jaime,Taena,Not you.
1652,Jaime,Taena,His  grandfather was Hand under Aerys.
1653,Jaime,Owen,"As I recall, he did so well that Aerys exiled him and seized his lands.Robert gave them back."
1654,Owen,Tywin,Taena would be pleased if Orton could recover the  rest.Is this about pleasing some Myrish whore?Here I thought it was about governing the realm.I govern the realm.
1655,Aerys,Cersei,"You need a strong Hand to help you.A weak ruler needs a strong Hand, as Aerys needed Father.A strong ruler requires only a  diligent servant to carry out his orders."
1656,Aerys,Cersei,Lord Hallyne might suit.He  would not be the first pyromancer to serve as the Kings Hand.
1657,Aerys,Cersei,There is talk that you mean to make Aurane Waters the master of  ships.Has someone been informing on me?Waters is well suited to the office.
1658,Jaime,Tommen,Aurane is strong and vigorous.
1659,Daenerys,Reznak,
1660,Moon,Paxter,"Aurane Waters could command a skiff, but only if you  bought him one.You are a child, Jaime."
1661,Cersei,Qyburn,"I want none of Lord Tyrells creatures on my council.Tommens council, you mean.You know what I mean."
1662,Cersei,Qyburn,"I know that Aurane Waters is a bad idea, and Hallyne is a worse one."
1663,Qyburn,Vargo,The Citadel stripped him of his  chain!The grey sheep.
1664,Qyburn,Vargo,"And he is loyal, which is more  than I can say of mine own kin."
1665,Kevan,Qyburn,"Cersei, listen to yourself."
1666,Aerys,Kevan,I am not your enemy.
1667,Aerys,Kevan,"I begged you for your help.I went down on my knees to you, and you  refused me!My vows..."
1668,Aerys,Jaime,Get out.Sister...
1669,Aerys,Jaime,Get out!
1670,Jaime,Loras,"I saw you in the yard today,You rode well.Better than well, surely."
1671,Jaime,Loras,"A more modest man might have answered My lord is too kind, or I had a good mount.The horse was adequate, and my lord is as kind as I am modest."
1672,Jaime,Loras,Lord Renly always said that books were for maesters.This one is for us.The history of every man who has ever worn a white cloak is written here.I have glanced at it.
1673,Aemon,Jaime,Lord Renly  owned a few with drawings that would turn a septon blind.
1674,Aemon,Jaime,"Theres none of that here, ser, but the histories will open your eyes.You  would do well to know about the lives of those who went before.I do.  You will have heard of  Lucamore Strong as well.Ser Lucamore the Lusty?"
1675,Conn,Loras,"Three wives and thirty children, was it?"
1676,Conn,Loras,"Shall I sing the song for you, my lord?And Ser Terrence Toyne?Bedded the kings mistress and died screaming.The lesson is, men who wear white breeches  need to keep them tightly laced.Gyles Greycloak?Orivel the Open-Handed?Gyles was a traitor, Orivel a coward."
1677,Conn,Loras,What is my lord  suggesting?Little and less.
1678,Loras,Robert,How about Long Tom  Costayne?
1679,Loras,Robert,He was a Kingsguard knight for sixty years.When was that?    
1680,Loras,Robert,What can you tell me of them?Flowers is a bastard name.So is Hill.Yet both men rose to command the Kingsguard.
1681,Loras,Robert,He was given his cloak  on a battlefield and died within an hour of donning it.He cant have been very good.Good enough.
1682,Jaime,Loras,Most  have been forgotten.Most deserve to be forgotten.
1683,Jaime,Loras,The best.The best and the worst.
1684,Jaime,Loras,And a few who were a bit of  both.Like him.
1685,Jaime,Loras,Who?
1686,Jaime,Loras,"Ten black pellets on a scarlet field.I do not  know those arms.They belonged to Criston Cole, who served the first Viserys and the second Aegon."
1687,Jaime,Loras,They called him Kingmaker.
1688,Baelor,Tyrion,"Your Grace,the small council...... will await my pleasure."
1689,Cersei,Tyrion,"Off  your knees,Show me what youve brought me."
1690,Dorcas,Jocelyn,"Youve killed the wrong dwarf,We never did,This is got to be him, ser."
1691,Cersei,Jocelyn,"Hes  rotted some, is all.He has also grown a new nose,A rather bulbous one, Id say.Tyrions  nose was hacked off in a battle."
1692,Cersei,Jocelyn,"No one told us,This one  come walking along as bold as you please, some ugly dwarf, so we thought...He said he were a sparrow,and you said he was lying."
1693,Cersei,Jocelyn,You have wasted my time and slain an innocent man.I should have your own heads off.
1694,Cersei,Jocelyn,"Remove yourselves from my sight.Aye, Your Grace,We beg your pardons.Do you want the head?"
1695,Jocelyn,Osmund,Give it to Ser Meryn.
1696,Jocelyn,Osmund,"Ser Osmund, see them out."
1697,Jocelyn,Osmund,"Clean that up at once,"
1698,Cersei,Osmund,"Someone will find the dwarf, never fear,And when they do, well  kill him good."
1699,Melara,Qyburn,"I have informers sniffing after the Imp everywhere, Your Grace,"
1700,Cersei,Dorcas,"Oldtown, Gulltown, Dorne, even the Free Cities.Wheresoever he might run, my whisperers will find him.You assume he left Kings Landing.He could be hiding in Baelors Sept for all we know,  swinging on the bell ropes to make that awful din."
1701,Dorcas,Qyburn,"Come, my lord.My council awaits."
1702,Dorcas,Qyburn,"Have you attended to that little task I set you?I have, Your Grace."
1703,Doran,Qyburn,"By way of pardon, I have lined a box of ebony and silver with felt, to  make a fitting presentation for the skull.A cloth sack would serve as well."
1704,Doran,Qyburn,He wont give a fig what sort  of box it comes in.
1705,Qyburn,Varys,"The bells will stop at sunset, Your Grace.That will be a great relief.How can you know?Knowing is the nature of my service."
1706,Boros,Jaime,"Ser Boros,you look quite grey this morning."
1707,Cersei,Harys,"My lords, I know you will forgive my lateness.We are here to serve Your Grace,It is our pleasure to anticipate your  coming.You all know Lord Qyburn, I am sure."
1708,Cersei,Pycelle,Lord Qyburn?
1709,Cersei,Pycelle,"Your  Grace, this... a maester swears sacred vows, to hold no lands or lordships...Your Citadel took away his chain,If he is not a maester, he cannot be  held to a maesters vows.We called the eunuch lord as well, you may recall."
1710,Cersei,Pycelle,"This man is... he is unfit...Do not presume to speak to me of fitness. He raised a spotted hand, as if to ward off a blow.  "
1711,Orton,Qyburn,"My lord, you know your fellow councillors?I would be a poor informer if I did not, Your Grace."
1712,Gyles,Orton,masters
1713,Kevan,Orton,Will the king be joining us?
1714,Aurane,Orton,My son is playing with his little queen.
1715,Aurane,Orton,His Grace is still too young to comprehend affairs of state.And our valiant Lord Commander?Ser Jaime is at his armorers being fitted for a hand.
1716,Aurane,Cersei,And I daresay he would find these proceedings as tiresome as Tommen.
1717,Cersei,Orton,"Do we have wine?We do, Your Grace."
1718,Cersei,Pycelle,"We have  Dornish red and Arbor gold, and a fine sweet hippocras from Highgarden.The gold, I think.I find Dornish wines as sour as the Dornish.I suppose we had as well begin with them."
1719,Doran,Pycelle,As you  command.
1720,Balon,Doran,The prince writes that he cannot hope to calm the waters until he receives the justice that  was promised him.To be sure.
1721,Balon,Harys,"His long wait is almost done.I am sending  Balon Swann to Sunspear, to deliver him the head of Gregor Clegane."
1722,Balon,Harys,Ah.
1723,Aurane,Cersei,"He is dead  then?Ser Gregor?I would think so, my lord,I am told that removing the head from  the body is often mortal."
1724,Pycelle,Qyburn,"Ser  Gregor perished of his wounds, just as Grand Maester Pycelle foretold."
1725,Pycelle,Qyburn,The spear was poisoned.No man could have  saved him.So you said.I recall it well.
1726,Pycelle,Qyburn,"What were you speaking of when  I arrived, Ser Harys?Sparrows, Your Grace."
1727,Jaime,Tywin,
1728,Cersei,Stannis,"And long past time, wouldnt you agree?"
1729,Qyburn,Stannis,The Faith should oppose such evil.
1730,Pycelle,Qyburn,"Our late High Septon let too much pass, I  fear.Age had dimmed his sight and sapped his strength.He was an old done man, Your Grace."
1731,Pycelle,Qyburn,"His passing should not  have surprised us.No man can ask for more than to die peacefully in his sleep, full of years.No,but we must hope that his successor is more vigorous."
1732,Pycelle,Qyburn,"I have friends among the Most Devout as well, and  they speak of Septon Ollidor.Do not discount this man Luceon,Last night he feted thirty of the Most Devout  on suckling pig and Arbor gold, and by day he hands out hardbread to the poor to prove his  piety."
1733,Pycelle,Tyrion,"One will serve as well as another,but whosoever dons the  crystal crown must pronounce an anathema upon the Imp."
1734,Orton,Tyrion,"As for these pink sparrows, so long as they preach no  treason they are the Faiths problem, not ours."
1735,Cersei,Pycelle,"Maester, have you brought the letter from the Vale?I have, Your Grace."
1736,Pycelle,Yohn,"It is a  declaration, rather than a letter."
1737,Daenerys,Reznak,  A deal of rubbish.
1738,Harys,Petyr,"The question is, ought we allow this?Does Lord Baelish seek our help?"
1739,Harys,Petyr,Not as yet.
1740,Harys,Pycelle,His last letter mentions the rebels only  briefly before beseeching me to ship him some old tapestries of Roberts.
1741,Harys,Pycelle,"And these lords of the declaration, do they appeal to the  king to take a hand?They do not.Then... mayhaps we need do nothing.A war in the Vale would be most tragic,War?"
1742,Orton,Pycelle,"Lord Baelish is a most amusing man, but one does not  fight a war with witticisms."
1743,Cersei,Petyr,"And does it matter who is regent for  little Lord Robert, so long as the Vale remits its taxes?"
1744,Petyr,Pycelle,Lord Orton has convinced me.
1745,Aurane,Petyr,"Elsewise, the crown is content with whatever  dispositions they might make for the governance of the Vale during Robert Arryns minority.Very good, Your Grace.Might we discuss the fleet?"
1746,Aurane,Petyr,Fewer than a dozen of our ships survived  the inferno on the Blackwater.We must needs restore our strength at sea.
1747,Aurane,Orton,Strength at sea is most essential.Could we make use of the ironmen?
1748,Aurane,Orton,"The enemy of our enemy?What would the Seastone Chair want of us as the price of an alliance?They want the north,which our queens noble father promised  to House Bolton.How inconvenient,Still, the north is large."
1749,Gyles,Harys,"Bolton might consent, so long as we assure him that our  strength will be his once Stannis is destroyed.Balon Greyjoy is dead, I had heard,Do we know who rules the isles  now?Did Lord Balon have a son?Leo?"
1750,Gyles,Qyburn,"Theo?Theon Greyjoy was raised at Winterfell, a ward of Eddard Stark,He is not like  to be a friend of ours.I had heard he was slain,Was there only one son?"
1751,Harys,Varys,Brothers.
1752,Cersei,Varys,Were there not?
1753,Cersei,Stannis,I do not propose to climb in bed with  that sorry pack of squids.
1754,Aurane,Stannis,"What we  require is our own fleet.I propose we build new dromonds,Ten, to start with.Where is the coin to come from?"
1755,Gyles,Harys,"There is no...... no... we do not...The crown  incomes have never been greater,Ser Kevan told me so himself."
1756,Cersei,Gyles,... expenses... gold cloaks...Our lord treasurer is trying to say that we have too  many gold cloaks and too little gold.
1757,Chett,Moon,"Though large, the crown incomes are not large enough to  keep abreast of Roberts debts."
1758,Harys,Robert,"The monies saved will be used for the building of our new fleet.Your Grace is prudent,This is a wise measure."
1759,Harys,Pycelle,"I concur.And I,Your Grace,this will cause more trouble than you know, I  fear.The Iron Bank..."
1760,Harys,Pycelle,A Lannister  pays his debts.The Braavosi have a saying too.
1761,Harys,Pycelle,"The Iron Bank will  have its due, they say.The Iron Bank will have its due when I say they will."
1762,Harys,Pycelle,"Lord Waters, commence the building of your dromonds.Very good, Your Grace."
1763,Aurane,Harys,The next matter... we have had a letter from Lord  Frey putting forth some claims...How many lands and honors does that man want?
1764,Aurane,Harys,"His mother must have  had three teats.My lords may not know,but in the winesinks and pot shops of this city, there  are those who suggest that the crown might have been somehow complicit in Lord Walders  crime."
1765,Aurane,Harys,Do you refer to the Red Wedding?
1766,Aurane,Harys,Crime?
1767,Gyles,Qyburn,"These sparrows are especially outspoken,The Red Wedding was an affront  to all the laws of gods and men, they say, and those who had a hand in it are damned."
1768,Cersei,Qyburn,Lord Walder must soon face the Fathers judgment.
1769,Harys,Pycelle,"It has nought to do with us.No,No,No one could think so,"
1770,Gyles,Pycelle,"A little spittle on Lord Walders tomb is not like to disturb the grave worms,but it would also be useful if someone were to be punished for the Red Wedding. said Pycelle. mused Cersei, "
1771,Aurane,Walder,"What better way for the new Lord of the Crossing to rid himself  of inconvenient half brothers, disagreeable cousins, and scheming sisters than by naming them  the culprits?Whilst we await Lord Walders death, there is another matter,The  Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr.Around the docks Ive heard men say that  Lord Stannis has hired them and is bringing them across the sea.What would he pay them with?"
1772,Aurane,Cersei,Snow?
1773,Aurane,Cersei,"How much gold does Stannis have?Little enough,Lord Qyburn has spoken to the crew of that Myrish  galley in the bay."
1774,Cersei,Daven,"If they mean to cross  to Westeros, they are marching in the wrong direction.Perhaps they grew weary of fighting on the losing side,There is that as well,Only a blind man could fail to see our war is all but  won."
1775,Pycelle,Roose,"Then only Stannis himself will remain to vex us.If Lord Janos can be believed, he is trying to make common cause with the wildlings,Savages in skins,Lord Stannis must be desperate indeed, to  seek such allies.Desperate and foolish,The northmen hate the wildlings."
1776,Harys,Pycelle,"Its lord has agreed to marry both his granddaughters to our friends of Frey and open  his port to our ships.I thought we had no ships,Wyman Manderly was a loyal bannerman to Eddard Stark,Can  such a man be trusted?"
1777,Harys,Pycelle,"Hes a fat old man, and frightened."
1778,Gregor,Harys,He insists that he will not bend the knee until his heir has been returned to him.Do we have this heir?
1779,Gregor,Harys,"He will be at Harrenhal, if he is still alive.Gregor Clegane took him captive."
1780,Gregor,Harys,"If he is dead,  I suppose we will need to send Lord Manderly the heads of those who killed him, with our most  sincere apologies."
1781,Pycelle,Renly,Will not Lord Stannis seek to win the allegiance of White Harbor as well?
1782,Pycelle,Renly,"Oh, he has tried."
1783,Pycelle,Renly,"Stannis  demands White Harbors swords and silver, for which he offers... well, nothing."
1784,Renly,Stannis,Just this morning there was another bird.
1785,Aurane,Qyburn,"He asks us what he should do with him.Send him here, that we might question him,The man might  know much of value.Let him die,His death will be a lesson to the north, to show them what  becomes of traitors.I quite agree,I have instructed Lord Manderly to have his head off forthwith.That should put an end to any chance of White Harbor supporting Stannis.Stannis will need another Hand,The turnip knight,  perhaps?A turnip knight?"
1786,Aurane,Harys,Who is this man?I have not heard of  him.
1787,Cersei,Pycelle,What if Lord Manderly should refuse?
1788,Cersei,Pycelle,He dare not.The onion knights head is the coin hell need to buy his sons life.
1789,Cersei,Pycelle,"The fat old fool may have been loyal to the Starks in his own way, but with the wolves  of Winterfell extinguished...Your Grace has forgotten the Lady Sansa,"
1790,Cersei,Pycelle,I most certainly have not forgotten that little she-wolf.
1791,Cersei,Pycelle,"I ought to have shown her to the black cells as the daughter of a traitor, but  instead I made her part of mine own household."
1792,Cersei,Sansa,"She is not dead... but before I am done with her, I promise you, she  will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss."
1793,Cersei,Sansa,"In any case,Lord Eddards younger daughter is with Lord Bolton, and  will be wed to his son Ramsay as soon as Moat Cailin has fallen."
1794,Petyr,Pycelle,"If the north must have a  Stark, well give them one."
1795,Petyr,Pycelle,"Another  problem has arisen on the Wall, however.The brothers of the Nights Watch have taken leave of  their wits and chosen Eddard Starks bastard son to be their Lord Commander.Snow, the boy is called,I glimpsed him once at Winterfell,though the Starks did their best to hide  him."
1796,Catelyn,Jaime,"Do as you  please,but you may find that the city is not a healthy place for a growing girl."
1797,Jon,Pycelle,"Snow shares Lord Eddards taste for treason  too,The father would have handed the realm to Stannis.The son has given him lands  and castles.The Nights Watch is sworn to take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,For thousands of years the black brothers have upheld that tradition.Until now,The bastard boy has written us to avow that the Nights Watch takes  no side, but his actions give the lie to his words.He has given Stannis food and shelter, yet has  the insolence to plead with us for arms and men.An outrage,We cannot allow the Nights Watch to join its  strength to that of Lord Stannis.We must declare this Snow a traitor and a rebel,The black brothers  must remove him."
1798,Aurane,Pycelle,"I propose that we inform Castle Black that no  more men will be sent to them until such time as Snow is gone.Our new dromonds will need oarsmen,Let us instruct the lords to send  their poachers and thieves to me henceforth, instead of to the Wall."
1799,Cersei,Qyburn,"The Nights Watch defends us all from snarks and  grumkins.My lords, I say that we must help the brave black brothers."
1800,Cersei,Qyburn,"What are you saying?This,For years now, the Nights Watch has begged for men."
1801,Cersei,Tommen,  
1802,Cersei,Tommen,That is just what we shall do.
1803,Aurane,Cersei,"It will need to be done carefully, to be sure.Leave the rest to me, my  lords."
1804,Aurane,Cersei,"We have  done good work today, my lords."
1805,Aurane,Cersei,"Is there aught else?One last thing, Your Grace,I hesitate to take up  the councils time with trifles, but there has been some queer talk heard along the docks of late."
1806,Aurane,Cersei,  
1807,Aurane,Cersei,"Come back to me when  you hear talk of dwarfs, my lord."
1808,Dorcas,Jocelyn,"What is it you all find so amusing?The Redwyne twins,Both of them have fallen in love with Lady Margaery."
1809,Dorcas,Taena,"Now both of them want to  join the Kingsguard, just to be near the little queen.The Redwynes have always had more freckles than wits."
1810,Cersei,Dorcas,"Dorcas, fetch me Ser Osney Kettleblack."
1811,Dorcas,Taena,As you command.
1812,Cersei,Taena,Why did she  turn so red?Love.
1813,Cersei,Taena,She fancies our Ser Osney.
1814,Osmund,Tyrion,"She likes his scars, I think."
1815,Petyr,Tyrion,"Just so.Scars make a man look  dangerous, and danger is exciting.You shock me, my lady,If danger excites you so, why wed Lord  Orton?"
1816,Orton,Taena,"My lord is more bountiful than dangerous, this is so."
1817,Orton,Taena,"I hope Your Grace  will not think the less of me, but I did not come a maid entire to Ortons bed."
1818,Cersei,Taena,"And pray, who was this lover who was so... full of danger?"
1819,Cersei,Taena,"Oh, I should not have spoken.Your  Grace will keep my secret, yes?Men have scars, women mysteries."
1820,Dorcas,Osney,"Come sit  with me by the window, Ser Osney.Will you take a cup of wine?"
1821,Dorcas,Osney,"Your cloak is threadbare.I have a mind to put you in a new one.What, a white one?Whos died?No one, as yet,Is that your wish, to join your brother Osmund in our  Kingsguard?Id rather be the queens guard, if it please Your Grace."
1822,Cersei,Osney,"You have a bold tongue, ser.You will make  me forget myself again.Good."
1823,Cersei,Osney,"My sweet queen.You are a wicked man,and no true knight, I think."
1824,Osney,Robert,Enough.It isnt.I want you.Youve had me.Only once.
1825,Cersei,Robert,"One good night for one good knight.You did me valiant service, and you had your reward."
1826,Cersei,Osfryd,Was  that a new horse you were riding in the yard yestermorn?The black stallion?
1827,Osfryd,Osney,"Midnight, I call him."
1828,Osfryd,Osney,"A fine mount for a battle.For pleasure, though, there is nothing to  compare to a gallop on a spirited young filly."
1829,Osfryd,Osney,Tell me  true.Do you think our little queen is pretty?
1830,Osfryd,Osney,I suppose.
1831,Osfryd,Osney,Id sooner have a woman.Why not both?
1832,Osfryd,Osney,"Pluck the little rose for me, and you will not find me to be  ungrateful.The little... Margaery, you mean?"
1833,Aegon,Osney,Shes the  kings wife.Wasnt there some Kingsguard who lost his head for bedding the kings wife?Ages ago.
1834,Cersei,Osney,Tommen is not Aegon the  Unworthy.
1835,Cersei,Osney,"I mean for Margaery to lose her head, not you."
1836,Cersei,Osney,"Her maidenhead, you mean?That too.Assuming she has still one."
1837,Cersei,Osney,Unless you think Margaery  would prove unresponsive to your...charms?
1838,Cersei,Osney,She likes me well enough.
1839,Cersei,Osney,"The last time Megga did that, Margaery  told them to stop and said I had a lovely face.There you are, then.There I am,but where am I going to be if she... if I...  after we..."
1840,Cersei,Osney,Lying with a queen is treason.Tommen  would have no choice but to send you to the Wall.The Wall?
1841,Cersei,Osney,"A black cloak  would go well with your eyes, and that black hair of yours.No one returns from the Wall.You will.All you need to do is kill a boy.What boy?A bastard boy in league with Stannis.Hes young and green, and youll have a hundred men."
1842,Cersei,Osney,"Ive killed more boys than I can count,Once this boy is dead,  Id get my pardon from the king?That, and a lordship."
1843,Cersei,Osney,A queen must have a consort.One who knows no fear.Lord Kettleblack?
1844,Cersei,Osney,"Aye, I like  the sound o that.  "
1845,Cersei,Osney,The Wall is cold.And I am warm.
1846,Cersei,Osney,Bed a girl and kill a boy and I am  yours.Do you have the courage?
1847,Cersei,Osney,"I am your man.You are, ser."
1848,Cersei,Osney,Enough for now.
1849,Cersei,Osney,Will you dream of me tonight?Aye.
1850,Cersei,Osney,And when youre abed with our Maid Margaery?
1851,Cersei,Osney,"When youre in  her, will you dream of me then?I will,Good."
1852,Cersei,Dorcas,Will you take a cup  of wine?
1853,Cersei,Dorcas,A small one.
1854,Cersei,Dorcas,"A big one.On the morrow I want you to pay a call on my good-daughter,Lady Margaery is always happy to see me.I know."
1855,Taena,Tommen,Tell her Ive sent seven beeswax candles to the Baelors Sept in memory of our dear  High Septon.
1856,Taena,Tommen,"If so, she will send seven-and-seventy candles of her own, so as not to be  outmourned.I will be very cross if she does not,Tell her also that she has a secret  admirer, a knight so smitten with her beauty that he cannot sleep at night.Might I ask Your Grace which knight?"
1857,Taena,Tommen,"Could it  be Ser Osney?It could be,"
1858,Cersei,Taena,"Will you do that?If it please you.That is all I wish, Your Grace."
1859,Cersei,Jaime,"A hundred times I told him no, and he said yes,until finally I was saying yes as well. the queen said with a wry smile."
1860,Nute,Victarion,"Balon stood  beneath those bones, when first he named himself a king,He swore to win us back  our freedoms, and Tarle the Thrice-Drowned placed a driftwood crown upon his head."
1861,Nute,Victarion,"BALON KING!They will shout your name as loud,"
1862,Asha,Victarion,"Balons sons are dead,and Asha is a  woman.When Victarion reminded them that Balon had commanded him to hold the Moat against the  northmen, Ralf Kenning said, What good to win this swamp and  lose the isles?The Crows Eye has been too long away."
1863,Balon,Euron,"Words are wind,"
1864,Aeron,Euron,"Brother against brother, ironborn against ironborn?"
1865,Nute,Rodrik,Is that Lord Harlaws Sea Song?
1866,Rodrik,Victarion,"Sea Song, aye."
1867,Rodrik,Victarion,"And theres old  Drumms Thunderer, with Blacktydes Nightflyer beside her."
1868,Rodrik,Victarion,Silverfin too.Some kin of Sawane Botley.
1869,Balon,Victarion,"He is here,Drop sail."
1870,Balon,Victarion,"None is to leave save at my command, neither man nor crow."
1871,Nute,Victarion,Lower a boat.I would go ashore.
1872,Nute,Victarion,"I put the chests  into your charge,See that they are strongly guarded."
1873,Nute,Victarion,"As you command, Your Grace."
1874,Aeron,Victarion,I am no king as yet.
1875,Aeron,Victarion,"Brother,what is dead can never die.But rises again, harder and stronger."
1876,Aeron,Victarion,Where is our brother Crows Eye?
1877,Aeron,Victarion,"His is the great tent of cloth-of-gold, there where the din is loudest."
1878,Aeron,Victarion,In him our fathers blood went bad.Our mothers blood as well.
1879,Balon,Euron,All have come?
1880,Balon,Victarion,All who matter.The captains and the kings.
1881,Aeron,Victarion,Do you mean  to claim our fathers crown?
1882,Aeron,Victarion,"If the Drowned God wills it.The waves will speak,Listen to the waves,  brother.Aye."
1883,Hotho,Victarion,"I have no luck with wives,"
1884,Hot,Hotho,"A king must have an heir,The Crows Eye brings three sons to show before  the kingsmoot.Bastards and mongrels.How old is this daughter?Twelve,Fair and fertile, newly flowered, with hair the color of honey."
1885,Hotho,Victarion,"She takes after her mother, more than me."
1886,Hot,Hotho,"I will gladly look at the girl once I am crowned,"
1887,Baelor,Victarion,"Balon was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is  maddest of them all,What of you, Lord Captain?If I shout your name, will  you make an end of this mad war?"
1888,Baelor,Victarion,Would you have me bend the knee?If need be.
1889,Balon,Victarion,"The Old Way is dead.What is dead can never die, but rises harder and stronger.In a hundred years men will sing of  Balon the Bold.Balon the Widowmaker, call him."
1890,Balon,Victarion,Have you one to  give me?
1891,Qarl,Victarion,The Bloody CupSteel Rain
1892,Qarl,Victarion,"Asha,Niece."
1893,Asha,Victarion,Nuncle.
1894,Asha,Victarion,I am pleased to  see you at my queensmoot.Queensmoot?
1895,Nute,Victarion,"Are you drunk, niece?"
1896,Nute,Victarion,I did not spy your Black Wind  on the strand.I beached her beneath Norne Goodbrothers castle and rode across the island.
1897,Asha,Nute,"Who holds the Moat?Ralf Kenning.With the Young Wolf dead, only the bog devils remain to plague us.The Starks were not the only northmen.The Iron Throne has named the Lord of the Dreadfort  as Warden of the North.Would you lesson me in warfare?I was fighting battles when you were sucking mothers  milk.And losing battles too."
1898,Asha,Victarion,"Every man should lose a battle in his youth,  so he does not lose a war when he is old.You have not come to make a claim, I hope."
1899,Asha,Victarion,"And if I have?There are men who remember when you were a little girl, swimming naked in the sea and  playing with your doll.I played with axes too.You did,but a woman wants a husband, not a crown."
1900,Asha,Victarion,"But I am the child of King Balons body, so I come before you both."
1901,Euron,Victarion,"Crows Eye,King Crows Eye, brother."
1902,Euron,Victarion,We shall have no king but from the kingsmoot.
1903,Euron,Victarion,"No godless man......may sit the Seastone Chair, aye."
1904,Euron,Victarion,As it happens as I have oft  sat upon the Seastone Chair of late.It raises no objections.
1905,Euron,Victarion,Who  knows more of gods than I?
1906,Aeron,Chett,Protect me from the Silence.
1907,Aeron,Chett,Godless?
1908,Aeron,Chett,"From Ib to  Asshai, when men see my sails, they pray."
1909,Aeron,Chett,"They pray to trees and golden idols and goat-headed  abominations.   said Euron, "
1910,Aeron,Victarion,Perhaps it should be you who kneels to me for  blessing.
1911,Aeron,Victarion,"Fools,fools and thralls and blind men, that is what you are."
1912,Asha,Victarion,"Lord Captain, have  you no greeting for a brother long away?"
1913,Asha,Victarion,"How fares your lady mother?Poorly,Some man made her a widow."
1914,Asha,Euron,I had heard the Storm God swept Balon to his death.
1915,Asha,Euron,"Tell me his name, niece, so I might revenge myself on him."
1916,Asha,Euron,"You know his name as well as I.Three years you were gone from us, and  yet Silence returns within a day of my lord fathers death.Do you accuse me?"
1917,Asha,Euron,Should I?
1918,Euron,Victarion,Do I command the winds?
1919,Euron,Victarion,"No, Your Grace,No man commands the winds,Would that you did,You would sail wherever you liked and never be  becalmed.There you have it, from the mouths of three brave men,The Silence was at sea  when Balon died.If you doubt an uncles word, I give you leave to ask my crew.A crew of mutes?Aye, that would serve me well.A husband would serve you well."
1920,Euron,Lucas,"Torwold, I  misremember, do you have a wife?Only the one."
1921,Asha,Lucas,"I am unwed,And for good reason,All women do despise the Codds as well."
1922,Asha,Lucas,You still have your famous hand.
1923,Jon,Lucas,"Was that courteous, Asha?You  have wounded Lucas to the quick.Easier than wounding him in the prick.   snarled Pinchface Jon Myre. said Asha. suggested the Red Oarsman. said Asha, "
1924,Euron,Victarion,"Here is my husband, Nuncle.Any man  who wants me should take it up with him."
1925,Euron,Victarion,"Ill have no blood shed here.Euron, take your...  pets... and go.I had looked for a warmer welcome from you, brother.I am your elder... and soon, your  rightful king."
1926,Euron,Victarion,"When the kingsmoot speaks, we shall see who wears the driftwood  crown.On that we can agree."
1927,Asha,Hotho,Nuncle.
1928,Asha,Hotho,"Walk with me, if you would."
1929,Asha,Victarion,"Tell me true, nuncle,why did Euron go away so suddenly?The Crows Eye oft went reaving.Never for so long.He took the Silence east.A lengthy voyage.I asked why he went, not where."
1930,Asha,Victarion,"When I came home, Euron was gone and your new wife was dead.She was only a salt wife."
1931,Asha,Victarion,"My father refused to speak of her,It does no good to speak of things no man can change."
1932,Asha,Victarion,I saw  the Readers longship.It took all my charm to winkle him out of his Book Tower.
1933,Asha,Victarion,You cannot hope to rule.You are a  woman.Is that why I always lose the pissing contests?
1934,Asha,Victarion,"Nuncle, it grieves me to say so,  but you may be right."
1935,Asha,Victarion,Not enough.
1936,Asha,Victarion,I am of a mind to shout my nuncles  name.Which uncle?
1937,Asha,Victarion,You have three.Four.
1938,Asha,Victarion,I will place the driftwood crown upon your brow myself... if you will  agree to share the rule.Share the rule?How could that be?
1939,Asha,Balon,"The Seastone Chair seats but one.Then let my nuncle sit,I will stand behind you, to guard your back and whisper  in your ear."
1940,Asha,Balon,"Let me be your Hand, Nuncle."
1941,Asha,Torrhen,Why would you wish to be my Hand?To end this war before this war ends us.
1942,Daenerys,Reznak,  Victarion chuckled.
1943,Asha,Victarion,"We will have all the north, as your lord father dreamed.When longships learn to row through trees, perhaps."
1944,Asha,Victarion,"The north is too large for us to hold,  and too full of northmen.Go back to your dolls, niece.Leave the winning of wars to warriors."
1945,Asha,Victarion,"I have two hands.No man needs three.I know a man who needs House Harlaw, though.Hotho Humpback has offered me his daughter for my queen.If I take her, I will have the  Harlaws."
1946,Asha,Victarion,"Lord Rodrik rules House Harlaw.Rodrik has no daughters, only books.Hotho will be his heir, and I will be the king."
1947,Asha,Victarion,"The Crows Eye has been too long away.Some men look larger at a distance,Walk amongst the cookfires if you dare,  and listen."
1948,Tywin,Victarion,   Victarion insisted.
1949,Asha,Balon,And killed your wife  as well... did he not?
1950,Balon,Euron,He put a baby in her belly  and made me do the killing.
1951,Euron,Victarion,  
1952,Euron,Victarion,She gave me horns.I had no choice.
1953,Euron,Victarion,"She came to me  wet and willing,It seems Victarion is big everywhere but where it matters."
1954,Aeron,Victarion,"I am sorry for you,and sorrier for her... but you leave me small choice but to  claim the Seastone Chair myself."
1955,Aeron,Victarion,"Your breath is yours to waste, woman.It is,"
1956,Aeron,Chett,"Damphair,"
1957,Aeron,Chett,Is it time?
1958,Daenerys,Reznak,It is.
1959,Aeron,Balon,"We were born from the sea, and to the sea we all  return,The Storm God in his wrath  plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down, yet now he feasts beneath the waves in the  Drowned Gods watery halls."
1960,Aeron,Balon,Balon is dead!The iron king is  dead!The king is dead!
1961,Aeron,Balon,"Yet what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger!"
1962,Aeron,Balon,"Balon has fallen, Balon my brother, who honored the Old Way and paid the iron price."
1963,Aeron,Balon,"Balon is dead... but an iron king shall rise again, to sit upon the Seastone Chair and rule the  isles.A king shall rise!"
1964,Aeron,Balon,He shall rise!He shall.He must.
1965,Aeron,Balon,But who?
1966,Aeron,Balon,Is he here among us now?
1967,Aeron,Balon,Who shall be king over us?
1968,Aeron,Euron,"The ironborn must have a king,I ask again.Who  shall be king over us?I will,Gylbert!"
1969,Aeron,Chett,"I am Gylbert  Farwynd, Lord of the Lonely Light,"
1970,Aeron,Chett,"Make me your king, and I shall lead you there,We will build ten thousand ships as Nymeria once did and take sail with all our people  to the land beyond the sunset.There every man shall be a king and every wife a queen."
1971,Daenerys,Reznak,Gylbert!
1972,Aeron,Chett,I ask again.Who shall be king over us?Me!
1973,Aeron,Brea,"Aye, me!"
1974,Aeron,Brea,Why not?
1975,Aeron,Brea,"Show them  my hammer, Thormor."
1976,Aeron,Brea,"I cant count  how many hands Ive smashed to pulp with that hammer,"
1977,Chett,Jacelyn,ERIK KING!
1978,Asha,Chett,Erik!
1979,Aeron,Asha,"Erik, stand up."
1980,Aeron,Asha,Girl.
1981,Aeron,Asha,"What did you say?Stand up, Erik,Stand up and Ill shout your name with all the rest."
1982,Aeron,Asha,Stand up and take it.
1983,Aeron,Euron,Who shall rule the ironborn?
1984,Aeron,Euron,Who shall be king over us?

2095,Brienne,Dick,"Best we keep a watch tonight, mlady,A place like this, there might be squishers.Squishers?"
2096,Brienne,Dick,"Monsters,They look like men till you get close, but their  heads is too big, and they got scales where a proper mans got hair."

2112,Brienne,Podrick,Theres a rider.Where?
2113,Brienne,Podrick,On the road.
2114,Brienne,Podrick,Down there.
2115,Brienne,Dick,"Dont squint at me,Hes naught t do with old Nimble Dick, whoever he is."
2116,Brienne,Dick,"Or one o them singers, wandering  from place to place."
2117,Brienne,Dick,"Hes no squisher, thats bloody certain.Their  sort dont ride horses.No,"
2118,Brienne,Dick,"Brunes too old to go climbing wallwalks, and his sons and grandsons went off to  the wars.No one left in there but wenches, and a snot-nosed babe or three."
2119,Brienne,Dick,"You speak of Lord Brune as if you know him,Might be I did, once."
2120,Brienne,Dick,"We should ride on,before Brune starts to wonder why were here beneath his  walls."
2121,Brienne,Dick,"No more roads from here on, only streams and  game trails, but mlady need not fear.Nimble Dick knows these parts."
2122,Brienne,Dick,What about that rider?
2123,Brienne,Dick,What about him?
2124,Brienne,Dick,He wont have no road to follow there.
2125,Brienne,Chett,"As  you will,"
2126,Dick,Podrick,"A bear  there was, a bear, a bear, all black and brown, and covered with hair,"
2127,Brienne,Podrick,"Its bad here,This is a bad place."
2128,Brienne,Dick,"A pine wood is a gloomy place, but in  the end its just a wood.Theres naught here that we need fear.What about the squishers?And the heads?Theres a clever lad,"
2129,Brienne,Dick,"There are no squishers,and no  heads."
2130,Brienne,Dick,"Its no matter,Well go  back up the hill and come down another way."
2131,Brienne,Dick,How much longer?
2132,Brienne,Dick,"We must have seen  every tree in Crackclaw Point by now.Not hardly,Were close now."
2133,Brienne,Dick,Were near the  narrow sea.
2134,Brienne,Chett,"You have a mans strength in your arms,but your heart is as soft as any maids."
2135,Brienne,Chett,A piglet  is a piglet.
2136,Brienne,Dick,"Remember that, girl."
2137,Dick,Podrick,"The Whispers,Have a listen.You can hear the heads."
2138,Brienne,Podrick,I hear them.
2139,Brienne,Podrick,"There are no heads,Its the waves you hear  whispering.Waves dont whisper.Its heads."
2140,Brienne,Dick,"Thats the old beacon tower,It fell when I was  half as old as Pods here."
2141,Brienne,Dick,See?
2142,Brienne,Dontos,Keep your hands off me.
2143,Brienne,Dontos,I was only...I dont care what you were only.
2144,Brienne,Dontos,"This fool o yours, hes not a man to hold a grudge, is  he?"
2145,Brienne,Dontos,"I mean, last night I got to thinking that he might be angry at old Nimble  Dick, on account o that map I sold him, and how I left out that the smugglers dont land here no  more.With the gold that youve got coming, you can give him back whatever he paid you for your  help."
2146,Brienne,Dontos,"That is, if hes even here."
2147,Brienne,Podrick,"No ones used this gate for a long time.I could climb over,By the cliff.Where the wall fell down.Its too dangerous."
2148,Brienne,Podrick,There has to  be a postern gate.
2149,Brienne,Sansa,"Someones been through  here, and recently.Your fool and those girls,I told you."
2150,Dontos,Podrick,"Im going in,Crabb, youll come  with me.Podrick, I want you to watch the horses.I want to come too."
2151,Brienne,Podrick,I can fight.Thats why I want you to stay here.
2152,Brienne,Podrick,We dare not leave  the horses unprotected.
2153,Brienne,Podrick,As you say.
2154,Brienne,Dick,"Go on, mlady,What are you waiting for?Old Crabbs been  dead a thousand years."
2155,Brienne,Dick,"I should have used the swordI should have used the magic sword.Podrick,Theres a sword and scabbard wrapped up in my bedroll.Bring them  here to me.Yes, ser."

2162,Dick,Podrick,"Its the sword that makes the lord, some say."
2163,Dick,Podrick,"With me,"
2164,Brienne,Dick,"Halloooooo,Anyone here?Be quiet,Someone might be hiding.Wanting to get a look at us before they show themself."
2165,Brienne,Dick,"Hallooooo,Anyone down there?"
2166,Brienne,Shagwell,"Here,Its your fool.Dick,to me."
2167,Dick,Shagwell,"Thats funny,"
2168,Brienne,Dick,"Oh, look,its Smuggler Dick, the one who made the map for us. Dick whimpered,   I can make it stop.Leave him be,DONT!"
2169,Brienne,Shagwell,"Bad Shags,"
2170,Brienne,Shagwell,"You again, woman?"
2171,Brienne,Shagwell,Or did you miss our friendly  faces?
2172,Brienne,Shagwell,Its me she come for.
2173,Pyg,Timeon,"Im going to fuck her up the arse and pump her full of motley seed, until she  whelps a little me.You need to use a different hole for that, Shags,I best use all her holes, then.Just to make certain."
2174,Brienne,Timeon,There are only three of you.
2175,Brienne,Timeon,"We all went our own ways, after we left Harrenhal."
2176,Rorge,Timeon,"Me and my lads made for  Maidenpool, but we couldnt get near a ship."
2177,Harren,Rorge,"You did for  Vargo with that bite, you know."
2178,Brienne,Shagwell,"He was saving his cock for last, but  some bird called him to Kings Landing, so he finished it and rode off.I am not here for you. She almost said my sister. Shagwell announced happily. blurted Brienne. said Timeon."

2180,Brienne,Timeon,Damned dog.
2181,Brienne,Timeon,How do you know?Had it from one of Berics bunch.
2182,Brienne,Rorge,"We chanced on three of them after Harrenhal, and  winkled the tale from one before he died.He might have lied.He might have, but he didnt."
2183,Daenerys,Reznak,
2184,Shagwell,Timeon,"Stay away,I think Im going to fuck you up the nose, wench,Wont that be  amusing?He has a very small cock,Drop that pretty sword and might be well go  gentle on you, woman.We need gold to pay these smugglers, thats all.And if I give you gold, youll let us go?We will."
2185,Shagwell,Timeon,Once youve fucked the lot of us.
2186,Brienne,Vargo,Whats your choice?This.
2187,Pyg,Timeon,"Your turn,Throw it.So you can dance away and charge me?"
2188,Pyg,Shagwell,"Get her, Shags.You get her,Did you see what she did to Pyg?Shes mad with moon blood."
2189,Brienne,Timeon,"Get her,and you can fuck her corpse.Oh, you do love me."
2190,Brienne,Jaime,"Mother have mercy,Finish it.Send me back to Dorne, you bloody bitch."
2191,Podrick,Shagwell,I told you I could  fight!
2192,Brienne,Shagwell,"I yield,I yield."
2193,Brienne,Jaime,"Dig a grave.There, beneath the weirwood."
2194,Brienne,Jaime,I have no spade.You have two hands.
2195,Dick,Jaime,Why bother?Leave them for the crows.Timeon and Pyg can feed the crows.
2196,Dick,Jaime,This is  his place.
2197,Brienne,Dick,Im sorry that I never trusted you.I dont know how to do that anymore.
2198,Brienne,Shagwell,"Laugh,"
2199,Brienne,Shagwell,"Laugh,Laugh!"
2200,Brienne,Dick,"Why did you do that, my lady?Ser?"
2201,Brienne,Hyle,It was the reward I promised him for finding me the fool.
2202,Hyle,Sansa,"If there are brothels down in hell, the wretch will thank you,Elsewise, thats a waste of good gold.I keep my promises.What are you doing here?Lord Randyll bid me follow you."
2203,Brienne,Sansa,"Have no fear, I was commanded not to harm you."
2204,Brienne,Sansa,"As if you could.What will you do now, my lady?Cover him.About the girl, I meant.The Lady Sansa."
2205,Brienne,Hyle,"She was making for Riverrun, if Timeon told it true."
2206,Brienne,Hyle,   she said stubbornly.
2207,Arianne,Garin,"It is lovely here,"
2208,Arianne,Spotted,"How did you know of this place?My uncle brought me here, with Tyene and Sarella."
2209,Arianne,Spotted,"He  caught some vipers and showed Tyene the safest way to milk them for their venom.Sarella  turned over rocks, brushed sand off the mosaics, and wanted to know everything there was to  know about the people who had lived here.And what did you do, princess?"
2210,Arianne,Garin,"I dreamed,and when the sun went down I sat cross-legged at my  uncles feet and begged him for a story.Prince Oberyn was full of stories."
2211,Arianne,Garin,"He  told about Prince Garin, I remember, the one that I was named for.Garin the Great,the wonder of the Rhoyne.Thats the one.He made Valyria tremble.They trembled,then they killed him."
2212,Arianne,Garin,"I shall remain Darkstar, I think.At  least it is mine own."
2213,Arianne,Sylva,"And the Golden Company broke its  contract with Myr, just as the Myrmen were about to go to war with Lys.The Lyseni bought them off,Clever Lyseni,Clever, craven Lyseni."
2214,Arianne,Quentyn,"Beneath the gold the  bitter steel,"
2215,Gerold,Quentyn,"I believe Ill have a piss.Watch where you set your feet,It has been a while since Prince Oberyn  milked the local vipers.I was weaned on venom, Dalt.Any viper takes a bite of me will rue it."
2216,Arianne,Gerold,"Forgive me, princess,but I do not like that man.A pity,I believe hes half in love with you.We need him,It may be that we will need his sword, and we will  surely need his castle.High Hermitage is not the only castle in Dorne,and you have  other knights who love you well. he affirmed."
2217,Doran,Garin,"I like it no more than you do,but there is a blood debt, and Quentyn is the only coin Lord Ormond will  accept.Coin?"
2218,Doran,Garin,"He is your son.What sort of father uses his own flesh and  blood to pay his debts?The princely sort,"
2219,Garin,Gerold,Princess.
2220,Arianne,Gerold,How was your piss?
2221,Arianne,Gerold,The sands were duly grateful.
2222,Elia,Oberyn,"It occurred to me as I was pissing that  this plan of yours may not yield you what you want.And what is it I want, ser?The Sand Snakes freed."
2223,Elia,Oberyn,You want a  little taste of lion blood.
2224,Elia,Oberyn,I want justice.Call it what you will.
2225,Gerold,Myrcella,The lion is not so easily provoked.The lions dead.Who knows which cub the lioness prefers?The one in her own den.
2226,Gerold,Myrcella,"This is how you start a war.Not with a crown of gold, but with a blade of steel."
2227,Gerold,Myrcella,Put that away.
2228,Gerold,Myrcella,"And Ser Arys  will permit no harm to come to his precious princess, you know that.No, my lady.What I know is that Daynes have been killing Oakhearts for several thousand  years."
2229,Gerold,Myrcella,It seems to me that Oakhearts have been killing Daynes  for just as long.We all have our family traditions.
2230,Gerold,Myrcella,"The moon is rising, and I see  your paragon approaching."
2231,Spotted,Sylva,Your Grace.My lady liege.
2232,Garin,Sylva,"My queen, I am your man."
2233,Arianne,Myrcella,Why do they call me Grace?
2234,Arianne,Myrcella,"Ser Arys, what is this place, and who are they?"
2235,Arianne,Myrcella,"They are my true and loyal friends, Your Grace... and would be your friends as well.Princess Arianne?"
2236,Arianne,Myrcella,"Why do they call me queen?Did  something bad happen to Tommen?He fell in with evil men, Your Grace,and I fear they have conspired with him  to steal your throne.My throne?You mean, the Iron Throne?"
2237,Arianne,Myrcella,"He never  stole that, Tommen is...... younger than you, surely?I am older by a year.That means the Iron Throne by rights is yours,Your brother is only a little  boy, you must not blame him."
2238,Arianne,Myrcella,May I have the  honor of presenting them?
2239,Arianne,Myrcella,"Your Grace, I give you Ser Andrey  Dalt, the heir to Lemonwood.My friends call me Drey,and I should be greatly honored if Your Grace would do  the same."
2240,Myrcella,Sylva,"Until I know  you I must call you ser.Whatever name Your Grace prefers, I am her man.Might I present Lady Sylva Santagar, my queen?"
2241,Garin,Myrcella,"For my freckles, Your Grace,though they all pretend it is because I am the  heir to Spottswood."
2242,Arianne,Myrcella,"Here is  gay Garin of the orphans, who makes me laugh,His mother was my wet nurse.I am sorry she is dead,Shes not, sweet queen."
2243,Arianne,Myrcella,"Im of the orphans of the Greenblood, is what my lady means."
2244,Arianne,Gerold,"Last, but first in valor, I give  you Ser Gerold Dayne, a knight of Starfall."
2245,Arianne,Myrcella,"There was an Arthur Dayne,He was a knight of the Kingsguard in the days  of Mad King Aerys.He was the Sword of the Morning.He is dead.Are you the Sword of the Morning now?No.Men call me Darkstar, and I am of the night."
2246,Arianne,Myrcella,You must be hungry.
2247,Spotted,Sylva,"It  is kinder to the horses.And the riders,Come, Your Grace, warm yourself.I should be honored  if youd let me serve you."
2248,Arianne,Gerold,"My House goes back  ten thousand years, unto the dawn of days,Why is it that my cousin is the only  Dayne that anyone remembers?He was a great knight,He had a great sword,And a great heart."
2249,Arianne,Gerold,"Princess, I beg a moments word.Come."
2250,Arianne,Chett,How  much does the child know?Little enough.
2251,Arianne,Cersei,"She did all I asked of her, and never asked a question."
2252,Arianne,Cersei,There are other tidings you should hear.Tywin  Lannister is dead.
2253,Arianne,Cersei,Dead?Murdered by the Imp.The queen has assumed the regency.Has she?
2254,Myrcella,Tywin,"What became of the dwarf?Hes fled,Cersei is offering a lordship to whosoever delivers her his head."
2255,Arianne,Caleotte,"I see that queenmaking excites you, ser, but  we have no time for this.Later, I promise you."
2256,Arianne,Caleotte,"Did you meet with any  problems?Only Trystane.He wanted to sit beside Myrcellas bedside and play cyvasse with her.He had redspots when he was four, I told you."
2257,Arianne,Caleotte,"You should have put  out that Myrcella was suffering from greyscale, that would have kept him well away.The boy perhaps, but not your fathers maester.Caleotte,Did he try to see her?Not once I described the red spots on her face.He said that nothing could be done until the  disease had run its course, and gave me a pot of salve to soothe her itching."
2258,Arianne,Caleotte,"Good,And the handmaid?Is she convincing?From a distance."
2259,Arianne,Moon,Hell keep to Myrcellas chambers in any case.All we need is a few days.By that time the princess will be beyond my fathers reach.Where?
2260,Arianne,Moon,"Its time you told me the rest of the plan,  dont you think?"
2261,Arianne,Moon,"No, its time we rode."
2262,Myrcella,Tommen,"I am tired,Is it much farther?Where  are we going?Princess Arianne is taking Your Grace to a place where youll be safe,It is a long journey,"
2263,Garin,Myrcella,"They live on boats, and pole them  up and down the Greenblood and its vassals, fishing and picking fruit and doing whatever work  needs doing.Aye,and we sing and play and dance on water, and know much  and more of healing."
2264,Mors,Myrcella,"They are the Rhoynar,and their Mother was the river Rhoyne."
2265,Mors,Myrcella,"I thought you were the Rhoynar.You Dornishmen, I mean.We are in part, Your Grace."
2266,Garin,Myrcella,"The Mother in  their songs is not our Mother, but Mother Rhoyne, whose waters nourished them from the dawn  of days.Id heard the Rhoynar had some turtle god,The Old Man of the River is a lesser god,He was born from Mother River too,  and fought the Crab King to win dominion over all who dwell beneath the flowing waters.Oh,I understand youve fought some mighty battles too, Your Grace,It is said you show our brave Prince Trystane no mercy at the cyvasse table.He always sets his squares up the same way, with all the mountains in the front and his  elephants in the passes,So I send my dragon through to eat his elephants.Does your handmaid play the game as well?"
2267,Myrcella,Sylva,Rosamund?
2268,Myrcella,Sylva,"No.I tried to teach her, but she said the rules were too hard.She is a Lannister as well?"
2269,Myrcella,Sylva,"A Lannister of Lannisport, not a Lannister of Casterly Rock."
2270,Myrcella,Sylva,"Rosamund doesnt truly favor me, but when she dresses up in  my clothes people who dont know us think shes me.You have done this before, then?Oh, yes."
2271,Arianne,Myrcella,"She said we were doing it as a game, but it was meant to keep me safe in case the  ship was taken by my uncle Stannis."
2272,Arianne,Garin,"Princess,Id set a faster pace, unless you mean to kill the  child after all."
2273,Arianne,Small,"I know why my princess wears a veil,Elsewise her beauty would outshine the sun above."
2274,Small,Spotted,"No, your princess wears a veil to keep the glare out of her eyes and the sand  out of her mouth.You should do the same, ser."
2275,Arianne,Garin,"The arms of House Martell display the sun and spear, the Dornishmans two favored weapons,but of the two, the sun is  the more deadly."
2276,Garin,Myrcella,"Were almost there, Your Grace,"
2277,Arianne,Myrcella,"hovels built on rafts,"
2278,Arianne,Garin,"Wake up, you fish-eyed lagabeds,Your queen is here, and wants her royal welcome."
2279,Daenerys,Reznak,
2280,Arianne,Hot,"Theres  the last face Id hoped to see,Away!"
2281,Hot,Myrcella,"Arys, protect the princess..."
2282,Garin,Myrcella,"Yield, my princess,else we must slay all but the child and yourself,  by your fathers word."
2283,Arianne,Garin,"Yielding seems the wisest course,No!"
2284,Arianne,Garin,You  will not take her whilst I still draw breath.
2285,Arianne,Garin,"Are you blind or stupid, Oakheart?"
2286,Arianne,Garin,"Put up  your sword.Do as he says, Ser Arys,"
2287,Arianne,Hot,"Noooo,"
2288,Hot,Myrcella,"No,no,  please, this was not supposed to happen."
2289,Daenerys,Reznak,
2290,Hot,Myrcella,After  him!
2291,Areo,Hot,"The prince said I must bring you back to  Sunspear,"
2292,Arianne,Hot,"I am sorry, little princess."
2293,Arianne,Hot,How could he know?
2294,Arianne,Hot,I was so  careful.How could he know?Someone told.
2295,Arianne,Hot,Someone always tells.
2296,Arianne,Hot,"Ser Gregor,Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei."
2297,Arya,Jaqen,"Child,what are those names you whisper of a night?I dont whisper any names,You lie,All men lie when they are afraid."
2298,Arya,Jaqen,Tell  me of these names.
2299,Arya,Jaqen,"The names dont matter.They do,Tell me, child."
2300,Arya,Jaqen,"Theyre people I hate.I want them to die.We hear many such prayers in this House.I know,"
2301,Arya,Jaqen,Is that why you have come to us?
2302,Arya,Jaqen,"To learn our arts, so you may kill  these men you hate?"
2303,Arya,Jaqen,Maybe.Then you have come to the wrong place.
2304,Arya,Jaqen,"We are but his servants, sworn to do his will.Oh."
2305,Arya,Weasel,"Which god is he?Why, all of them,"
2306,Arya,Weasel,Who are you?
2307,Arya,Weasel,"No one,"
2308,Arya,Jon,"He has the scent to guide him,and the air is warmer where a candle burns."
2309,Arya,Chett,"Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser  Meryn, Queen Cersei."
2310,Arya,Moon,"He has many faces, and many ears to hear."
2311,Arya,Weese,You lie.
2312,Arya,Weese,Who are you?No one.Another lie.
2313,Amory,Tickler,"Death is not the worst thing,It is His gift to us, an end to want and  pain."
2314,Hodor,Jon,"When you smell our candles burning, what does it make you think of, my child?"
2315,Arya,Syrio,"I dont smell  anything,You lie,but you may keep your secrets if you wish, Arya of House Stark."
2316,Arya,Syrio,You know that you may leave this place.
2317,Arya,Syrio,"You may go home anytime you wish.You told me that if I left, I couldnt come back.Just so."
2318,Arya,Syrio,"I dont want to leave.Then stay... but remember, the House of Black and White is not a home for orphans."
2319,Arya,Syrio,"If you cannot obey, you must  depart.I can obey.We shall see."
2320,Arya,Syrio,"The gift of the  Many-Faced God takes myriad forms,but here it is always gentle."
2321,Harren,Weese,"It is pork, child,only pork."
2322,Arya,Chett,"You need to rid yourself of all this,"
2323,Arya,Chett,Theyre mine.And who are you?No one.
2324,Arya,Chett,This belongs to Arya of House Stark.
2325,Arya,Chett,"We are servants here.I serve,"
2326,Arya,Chett,"You play at being a servant, but in your heart you are a lords daughter."
2327,Arya,Chett,"Under them was always Arya.I dont wear gowns.You cant fight in a stupid gown.Why would you wish to fight?Are you some bravo, strutting through the alleys, spoiling for  blood?"
2328,Arya,Chett,"Before you drink from the cold cup, you must offer up all you are to Him of  Many Faces."
2329,Arya,Chett,"If you cannot bring yourself to do that, you must  leave this place.The iron coin......has paid your passage here."
2330,Chett,Jacelyn,"It takes  uncommon strength of body and spirit, and a heart both hard and strong."
2331,Chett,Jacelyn,Im strong.
2332,Chett,Jacelyn,Im hard.You believe this is the only place for you.
2333,Chett,Jacelyn,You are  wrong in that.
2334,Chett,Jacelyn,"Some  honest apprentice boy, a rich old man, a seafarer, whatever you desire."
2335,Chett,Jacelyn,"Is it Westeros you dream of, child?"
2336,Arya,Chett,Shall we find you passage on her?I only just came from Westeros.
2337,Arya,Chett,"Ill go if you dont want me, but I wont go there.My wants do not matter,It may be that the Many-Faced God has led  you here to be His instrument, but when I look at you I see a child... and worse, a girl child."
2338,Arya,Chett,No one can do both.
2339,Arya,Chett,I dont care about  that.You should.
2340,Arya,Chett,Can you do that?
2341,Arya,Chett,"No,I do  not think you can."
2342,Arya,Chett,"I could if I wanted to.So says Arya of House Stark, eater of grave worms.I can give up anything I want!"
2343,Arya,Chett,Then start with these.
2344,Jon,Robb,"Its just a sword,"
2345,Jon,Polliver,"little sister,"
2346,Arya,Chett,"Youll be safe here,No one will know where you are but me."
2347,Chett,Jacelyn,"One day,"
2348,Chett,Jacelyn,"Child,come sit with me."
2349,Chett,Jacelyn,The tale of our beginnings.
2350,Chett,Jacelyn,And  there were wyrms in that red darkness too.Earthworms?
2351,Chett,Jacelyn,Firewyrms.
2352,Arya,Chett,"The young ones are no  larger than that skinny arm of yours, but they can grow to monstrous size and have no love for  men.Did they kill the slaves?Burnt and blackened corpses were oft found in shafts where the rocks were cracked or full of  holes."
2353,Arya,Chett,"In times of peace they bred them, though only the worst were sent down to die in the  red darkness.Didnt the slaves rise up and fight?Some did,Revolts were common in the mines, but few accomplished much."
2354,Arya,Chett,The first Faceless Man was one who did.Who was he?
2355,Arya,Chett,"No one,Some say he was a slave himself."
2356,Arya,Chett,"All gods have their instruments, men and women who serve them and help to work their will  on earth."
2357,Arya,Chett,The first gift had been given.
2358,Arya,Chett,He killed the slave?
2359,Arya,Chett,"He should have  killed the masters!He would bring the gift to them as well... but that is a tale for another day, one best shared  with no one."
2360,Arya,Chett,"And who are you, child?No one.A lie.How do you know?Is it magic?A man does not need to be a wizard to know truth from falsehood, not if he has eyes."
2361,Arya,Chett,"The muscles here, at the corners of  the jaw, and here, where the neck joins the shoulders."
2362,Arya,Chett,Some liars blink.
2363,Arya,Chett,Can you tell dusk from dawn?
2364,Arya,Chett,"Then you can learn to see a lie... and once you do, no secret will be safe from you.Teach me."
2365,Arya,Chett,"She will teach you,Starting with  the tongue of Braavos."
2366,Arya,Chett,"Will you do  this?Yes,"
2367,Arya,Chett,"Who are you?No one,You lie,You must lie gooder."
2368,Arya,Chett,"Gooder?You mean better, stupid.Better stupid.I will show you."
2369,Arya,Chett,How many years have you?
2370,Arya,Chett,"Ten,"
2371,Arya,Chett,How many years have  you?
2372,Arya,Chett,"Youre  lying,"
2373,Arya,Chett,"She did not lie,The one you call waif is a woman grown who has spent her life serving Him of  Many Faces.She gave Him all she was, all she ever might have been, all the lives that were  within her."
2374,Arya,Chett,"Will I be like her?No,not unless you wish it."
2375,Arya,Syrio,"When you are not pouring, you must stand as  still as if you had been carved of stone,Can you do that?Yes."
2376,Harren,Roose,"Good,It would be best if you were blind and deaf as well."
2377,Arya,Harren,Do not listen.
2378,Arya,Chett,Are the other men all priests?
2379,Arya,Chett,"Were those their  real faces?What do you think, child?"
2380,Arya,Chett,Is Jaqen Hghar a priest too?Do you know if Jaqen will be coming back to  Braavos?Who?
2381,Arya,Chett,"Jaqen Hghar.He gave me the iron coin.I know no one by this name, child.I asked him how he changed his face, and he said it was no harder than taking a new name, if  you knew the way.Did he?Will you show me how to change my face?If you wish."
2382,Arya,Chett,Puff up your cheeks and  stick out your tongue.
2383,Arya,Chett,"There.Your face is changed.Thats not how I meant.Jaqen used magic.All sorcery comes at a cost, child.Years of prayer and sacrifice and study are required to work  a proper glamor.Years?"
2384,Arya,Chett,If it were easy all men would do it.
2385,Arya,Chett,"Why use a spell, where  mummers tricks will serve?I dont know any mummers tricks either.Then practice making faces."
2386,Arya,Chett,Learn to rule your face.Show me how.Puff up your cheeks.
2387,Arya,Chett,"Lift your eyebrows.No, higher."
2388,Arya,Chett,Good.
2389,Chett,Weese,"Eyes, nostrils, cheeks, ears,  lips, learn to rule them all."
2390,Chett,Weese,"Who are you?No one.A lie.A sad little lie, child."
2391,Arya,Brus,"Your accent is a horror,"
2392,Brus,Brusco,You must go.When?
2393,Brus,Brusco,"Where?Now,Beyond these walls you will find the hundred isles of Braavos in the sea.You have been taught the words for mussels, cockles, and clams, have you not?Yes."
2394,Brus,Brusco,It will serve.
2395,Brus,Brusco,"Do you understand?Yes.And when Brusco asks, who are you?No one.No.That will not serve, outside this House."
2396,Brus,Brusco,"I could be Salty, from Saltpans.Salty is known to Ternesio Terys and the men of the Titans Daughter.You are marked by the  way you speak, so you must be some girl of Westeros... but a different girl, I think."
2397,Brus,Brusco,Could I be Cat?Cat.
2398,Brus,Brusco,Yes.
2399,Brus,Brusco,  
2400,Brus,Brusco,Just so.
2401,Chett,Jacelyn,"And what was the name of the ship?Nymeria,"
2402,Arya,Gretchel,"Ser Gregor,"
2403,Arya,Gretchel,"Dunsen, Raff the  Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei."
2404,Arya,Gretchel,"Valar morghulis,valar  morghulis, valar morghulis."
2405,Gretchel,Lysa,"The fires almost out,Put another log on, if you would.As my lady wishes,"
2406,Petyr,Robert,misrulefalse friends and evil counselors
2407,Gretchel,Robert,"I wanted eggs,I wanted three eggs boiled soft, and some back bacon."
2408,Petyr,Robert,"You can have eggs when Mya comes, as many as you like,Shell bring eggs and butter and melons, all sorts of tasty things."
2409,Petyr,Robert,"I wanted eggs today.Sweetrobin, there are no eggs, you know that.Please, eat your porridge, its very nice."
2410,Petyr,Robert,"I am not  hungry,I want to go back to bed."
2411,Petyr,Robert,Maester  Colemon gave me dreamwine but I could still hear it.
2412,Petyr,Robert,"If there had been singing, I should have heard it too.You had a  bad dream, thats all.No, it wasnt a dream."
2413,Petyr,Robert,"Marillion was singing again.Your father says  hes dead, but he isnt.He is."
2414,Petyr,Robert,"Sweetrobin, he is.Marillion loved your lady mother too much and could  not live with what hed done to her, so he walked into the sky."
2415,Petyr,Robert,"Hes gone, truly.But I hear him every night."
2416,Petyr,Robert,"I told him to, but he wouldnt."
2417,Petyr,Robert,"Be a good boy and eat your porridge,Please?For me?I dont want porridge."
2418,Colemon,Petyr,"The lord wants eggs!The lord shall eat porridge and be thankful for it,"
2419,Colemon,Robert,"You  should heed the Lord Protector, my lord,Your lords bannermen are coming  up the mountain to pay you homage, so you will need all your strength."
2420,Petyr,Robert,Send them away.
2421,Petyr,Robert,"If they come,  Ill make them fly.You tempt me sorely, my lord, but I fear I promised them safe conduct,In any  case, it is too late to turn them back.By now they may have climbed as far as Stone.Why wont they leave us be?"
2422,Nestor,Petyr,"We never did them any harm.What do they  want of us?Just Lord Robert.Him, and the Vale."
2423,Nestor,Petyr,There will be eight of them.
2424,Nestor,Petyr,Ser Lyn is not the sort of man to stay  away when blood is in the offing.
2425,Daenerys,Reznak,"Thats not a point youll want to raise with Corbray, though."
2426,Lewyn,Robert,Why is he coming?
2427,Lewyn,Robert,"I  thought the Corbrays were for you.Lord Lyonel Corbray is well disposed toward my rule,"
2428,Petyr,Robert,"He wanted Lysas hand for himself.I dont like Ser Lyn,I wont have him here."
2429,Petyr,Robert,"The Eyrie is impregnable, Mother said.Your mother is dead, my lord.Until your sixteenth name day, I rule the Eyrie."
2430,Petyr,Robert,"Mela, fetch his lordship a new  spoon.He wants to eat his porridge.I do not!Let my porridge fly!"
2431,Colemon,Petyr,"Oh, gods be good,"
2432,Colemon,Petyr,"Take him back to bed and leech him,"
2433,Colemon,Lysa,"My lord, this parley might best be left for  another day."
2434,Lysa,Petyr,   Petyr said.
2435,Colemon,Petyr,"Lady Lysa would give his lordship her breast whenever he grew overwrought.Archmaester  Ebrose claims that mothers milk has many heathful properties.Is that your counsel, maester?"
2436,Colemon,Petyr,That way he can move directly from  his nurses nipples to his wifes.
2437,Colemon,Petyr,"No,  I think not."
2438,Colemon,Petyr,"The boy is fond of sweets, is he not?Sweets?"
2439,Colemon,Petyr,Sweets.
2440,Colemon,Petyr,"Just a pinch, to calm him and stop his wretched shaking.A pinch?"
2441,Colemon,Petyr,"One small  pinch... perhaps, perhaps.   Lord Petyr said, "
2442,Colemon,Petyr,"Father,will you have a bowl of porridge to break your  fast?I despise porridge."
2443,Colemon,Petyr,Id sooner break my fast with a  kiss.
2444,Chett,Petyr,How...dutiful.
2445,Chett,Petyr,"Well, I have other duties  for you, as it happens."
2446,Petyr,Waymar,What sort of cheese is left to us?The sharp white and the stinky blue.The white.And youd best change as well.
2447,Petyr,Waymar,Is it too...
2448,Petyr,Waymar,Need I remind you to avoid  sky blue and cream?No.
2449,Petyr,Waymar,"Eight, you said...Bronze Yohn is  one of them?The only one who matters.Bronze Yohn knows me,He was a guest at Winterfell when his son rode  north to take the black."
2450,Petyr,Waymar,"And that was not the only time.Lord Royce saw... he saw Sansa Stark again at Kings Landing, during the Hands tourney."
2451,Petyr,Sansa,"That Royce glimpsed this pretty face I do not doubt, but it  was one face in a thousand."
2452,Petyr,Sansa,"Men see what they expect to see, Alayne."
2453,Petyr,Sansa,Have Maddy lay a fire in the solar.I shall receive our Lords Declarant there.Not the High Hall?No.
2454,Petyr,Sansa,Cheeks born so low as mine must never aspire to such lofty cushions.The solar.
2455,Gregor,Sansa,"If you  gave them Robert...... and the Vale?They have the Vale.Oh, much of it, thats true."
2456,Amory,Gregor,Back to  my mighty stronghold on the Fingers?
2457,Amory,Gregor,"Joffrey gave you Harrenhal.You are lord in your own right there.By title.I needed a great seat to marry Lysa, and the Lannisters were not about to grant me  Casterly Rock.Yes, but the castle is yours.Ah, and what a castle it is.Cavernous halls and ruined towers, ghosts and draughts, ruinous to  heat, impossible to garrison... and theres that small matter of a curse.Curses are only in songs and stories."
2458,Amory,Gregor,Has someone made a song about Gregor Clegane dying of a  poisoned spear thrust?
2459,Cersei,Petyr,"Lothstons,  Strongs, Harroways, Strongs... Harrenhal has withered every hand to touch it.Then give it to Lord Frey."
2460,Cersei,Petyr,Perhaps I shall.
2461,Cersei,Petyr,Isnt that kind of her?
2462,Cersei,Petyr,Shes not kind.
2463,Cersei,Petyr,  Provided she does not  remove herself first.
2464,Cersei,Petyr,"In the game of thrones, even the  humblest pieces can have wills of their own."
2465,Cersei,Petyr,"Now, dont you have some duties to perform?"
2466,Robb,Yohn,"Lord Royce,will you have a cup of wine, to take the  chill off?"
2467,Nestor,Yohn,"Do I know you, girl?"
2468,Nestor,Yohn,"Alayne is  the Lord Protectors natural daughter,Petyrs little finger has been busy,"
2469,Anya,Nestor,"How old are you, child?"
2470,Anya,Nestor,"Four-fourteen, my lady."
2471,Anya,Nestor,"And I am no  child, but a maiden flowered.But not deflowered, one can hope."
2472,Anya,Nestor,"Yet,But ripe for plucking soon, Id say.Is that what passes for courtesy at Hearts Home?"
2473,Anya,Chett,"The girl is young and gently bred, and has suffered enough horrors.Mind your tongue, ser.My tongue is my concern,Your ladyship should take care to mind her own.I have never taken kindly to chastisement, as any number of dead men could tell you."
2474,Anya,Lothor,"Best take us to your father, Alayne.The sooner we  are done with this, the better.The Lord Protector awaits you in the solar.If my lords would follow me."
2475,Lothor,Petyr,"This way, if it please my lords."
2476,Lothor,Petyr,"My lords, be welcome."
2477,Nestor,Petyr,"Alayne, my sweet, more wine  for our noble guests.As you say, Father."
2478,Lothor,Petyr,"I have been reading this remarkable declaration of yours,Splendid."
2479,Lothor,Petyr,I only wish you had invited me to sign as well.
2480,Lothor,Petyr,You?
2481,Petyr,Yohn,"Sign?I wield a quill as well as any man, and no one loves Lord Robert more than I do."
2482,Petyr,Yohn,"Show me where to sign, I beg you."
2483,Daenerys,Reznak,We did not come for your signature.
2484,Petyr,Symond,As you  wish.
2485,Symon,Symond,"What would you have of me, my lords and lady?We will have naught of you."
2486,Petyr,Symond,We will have you gone.Gone?
2487,Horton,Petyr,"Where would I go?The crown has made you Lord of Harrenhal,That should  be enough for any man.The riverlands have need of a lord,Riverrun stands besieged,  Bracken and Blackwood are at open war, and outlaws roam freely on both sides of the Trident,  stealing and killing as they will.Unburied corpses litter the landscape everywhere you go.You make it sound so wonderfully attractive, Lord Redfort,"
2488,Robert,Yohn,"Would you have me  drag a sickly child into the midst of such carnage?His lordship will remain in the Vale,I mean to take the boy with me to Runestone, and raise him up to be a knight that Jon Arryn  would be proud of.Why Runestone?"
2489,Petyr,Yohn,"Why not Ironoaks or the Redfort?Why not Longbow Hall?Any of these would serve as well,and his lordship will visit each in  turn, in due time.Will he?"
2490,Petyr,Yohn,"Lord Petyr, if you think to set us one against the other, you may  spare yourself the effort."
2491,Petyr,Robert,"At Runestone he will also find other boys his own age, more suitable  companions than the old women and sellswords that presently surround him."
2492,Petyr,Robert,"His lordship needs companions, I do not disagree."
2493,Anya,Petyr,Each of them has a boy of an age with Robert.
2494,Anya,Petyr,Two pups from a pair of lapdogs.Robert should have an older boy about him too.
2495,Anya,Petyr,Someone he  could admire and try to emulate.
2496,Anya,Petyr,"You have such a boy at  Ironoaks, my lady.Perhaps you might agree to send me Harrold Hardyng."
2497,Anya,Yohn,"Lord Petyr, you are as bold a thief as Id ever care to meet.I do not wish to steal the boy,but he and Lord Robert should be friends."
2498,Petyr,Yohn,"It is meet and proper that Lord Robert should befriend  young Harry, and he shall... at Runestone, under my care, as my ward and squire.Give us the boy,and you may depart the Vale unmolested for your  proper seat at Harrenhal."
2499,Lysa,Petyr,"Are you suggesting that elsewise I might come to  harm, my lord?"
2500,Jon,Lysa,"My late wife seemed to think this was my proper seat.Lord Baelish,"
2501,Petyr,Robert,"By what right do you presume to rule us?Lysa named me Lord Protector, I do seem to recall.Lysa Tully was never truly of the Vale, nor had she the right to  dispose of us.And Lord Robert?"
2502,Nestor,Petyr,Will your lordship also claim that Lady Lysa had no right to  dispose of her own son?
2503,Anya,Nestor,I once hoped to wed  Lady Lysa myself.
2504,Petyr,Yohn,"It happens that she chose Lord Petyr, and entrusted her son to his care.He was Jon Arryns son as well, cousin,He  belongs to the Vale."
2505,Petyr,Yohn,"The Eyrie is as much a part of the Vale as Runestone.Unless  someone has moved it?Jape all you like, Petyr,The boy shall come with us.I am loath to disappoint you, Lord Belmore, but my stepson will be remaining here with me."
2506,Symon,Symond,"As his  stepfather and Lord Protector, I cannot permit it.Each of us has a thousand men at the foot of  this mountain, Petyr.What a splendid place for them.If need be, we can summon many more.Are you threatening me with war, ser?"
2507,Petyr,Yohn,We shall have Lord Robert.
2508,Petyr,Yohn,All this talk makes me ill. Petyr will talk you out of your smallclothes if you  listen long enough.The only way to settle his sort is with steel.
2509,Petyr,Sansa,"I wear no sword, ser.Easily remedied."
2510,Lothor,Sansa,"Your apple-eater holds a blade.Tell  him to give it to you, or draw that dagger."
2511,Lothor,Yohn,"Put up your steel, ser!"
2512,Lothor,Yohn,"We are guests here.This is unseemly.Sheathe your sword, Corbray,You shame us all with this.Come, Lyn,This will serve for nought.Put Lady Forlorn to  bed.My lady has a thirst,Whenever she comes out to dance, she likes a drop of  red.Your lady must go thirsty."
2513,Anya,Yohn,The Lords Declarant.
2514,Anya,Yohn,You should have named yourselves the Six Old  Women.
2515,Petyr,Yohn,"Lord Baelish,you must forgive us that display.Must I?"
2516,Petyr,Yohn,"You brought him here, my lords.It was never our intent...You brought him here."
2517,Petyr,Yohn,You gave us safe conduct!Yes.Be grateful that I have more honor than some.
2518,Lysa,Petyr,I have read your declaration and heard your demands.
2519,Lysa,Robert,"Grant me but a year, and with Lord Nestors  help I promise that none of you shall have any cause for grievance.So you say,Yet how shall we trust you?You dare call me untrustworthy?"
2520,Petyr,Robert,"If it is war you want, say so now and the Vale will bleed."
2521,Nestor,Petyr,"A year is not so long  a time,Mayhaps... if you gave assurances...None of us wants war,Autumn wanes, and we must gird  ourselves for winter."
2522,Nestor,Petyr,"At the end of this year...... if I have not set the Vale to rights, I shall willingly step down as Lord Protector,I call that more than fair,There must be no reprisals,No talk of treason or rebellion.You must  swear to that as well.Gladly,It is friends I want, not foes."
2523,Petyr,Yohn,"His brother is a good man, there is no need to bring down shame upon  a noble House."
2524,Petyr,Yohn,"My lords, perhaps we might confer?There is no need.It is plain that he has won."
2525,Petyr,Yohn,"I like it not, but it would seem you have your year."
2526,Petyr,Yohn,Not all of  us are fooled.
2527,Gretchel,Petyr,"Alayne,My sweet.What brings you  here so late?I had to know.What will happen in a year?"
2528,Gilwood,Petyr,Redfort and Waynwood are old.
2529,Eon,Petyr,"Bronze Yohn Royce will continue to be hostile, I fear, but so long as  he stands alone he is not so much a threat.And Ser Lyn Corbray?"
2530,Eon,Petyr,"Ser Lyn will remain my implacable enemy.He will  speak of me with scorn and loathing to every man he meets, and lend his sword to every secret  plot to bring me down."
2531,Eon,Petyr,And how shall you reward him for this  service?
2532,Eon,Petyr,"With gold and boys and promises, of course."
2533,Cersei,Petyr,All he likes is gold and boys and killing.
2534,Cersei,Dorcas,"I want to sit on the Iron Throne,You always let  Joffrey sit up there.Joffrey was twelve.But Im the king.The throne belongs to me.Who told you that?"
2535,Margaery,Tommen,No one told me.No one?Is that what you call your lady wife?
2536,Pate,Tommen,"If you lie to me, I will have no choice but to send for Pate and have him  beaten till he bleeds."
2537,Joffrey,Tommen,"Is that what  you want?No,Who told you?"
2538,Joffrey,Tommen,Lady Margaery.
2539,Joffrey,Tommen,That is better.
2540,Cersei,Tommen,"I suppose Margaery thinks you ought to be at my council meetings too?Yes,She says I have to learn to be king.When you are older, you can attend as many councils as you wish,I  promise you, you will soon grow sick of them.Robert used to doze through the sessions."
2541,Cersei,Tommen,"He preferred to hunt and hawk, and leave the tedium to old Lord  Arryn.Do you remember him?He died of a bellyache.So he did, poor man."
2542,Cersei,Tommen,"You may recite them to me on the  morrow.Yes, Mother,Thats my good boy."
2543,Cersei,Pycelle,"Seasoned men of proven loyalty,"
2544,Cersei,Pycelle,"The only thing these captains proved was that they know how to swim,No mother should outlive her children, and no captain should outlive his ship."
2545,Pycelle,Wyman,"Your Grace, glad  tidings,Wyman Manderly has done as you commanded, and beheaded Lord  Stanniss onion knight.We know this for a certainty?The mans head and hands have been mounted above the walls of White Harbor."
2546,Cersei,Roose,"And the hands, one marked by his shortened fingers.Very good,Send a bird to Manderly and inform him that his son will be  returned forthwith, now that he has demonstrated his loyalty."
2547,Cersei,Osmund,This is more properly a matter for  our lord treasurer.
2548,Cersei,Osmund,"I have spoken with Lord Gyles six  times.He coughs at me and makes excuses, Your Grace, but the gold is not forthcoming.Speak to him a seventh time,The number seven is sacred to our  gods.It pleases Your Grace to make a jest, I see.When I make a jest I smile."
2549,Cersei,Osmund,"I assure you, when  I make a jest, men laugh.King Robert......is dead,The Iron Bank will have its gold when this rebellion has been  put down."
2550,Cersei,Osmund,Your Grace...This audience is at an end.
2551,Cersei,Osmund,"Ser Meryn, show  the noble Noho Dimittis to the door.Ser Osmund, you may escort me back to my apartments."
2552,Cersei,Osmund,"How is your little  brother faring, pray?"
2553,Cersei,Osmund,"Ah... well enough, only...Only?"
2554,Osmund,Tommen,"I must confess, I am running short of  patience with dear Osney."
2555,Margaery,Osmund,Is the little queen blind to his charms?His charms is fine.
2556,Margaery,Osmund,Begging your pardon.
2557,Osmund,Osney,Its her thats the trouble.And why is that?
2558,Aurane,Tallad,Would the maid prefer someone else?Does your brothers face  displease her?She likes his face.
2559,Cersei,Osney,  
2560,Cersei,Osney,They are never alone.
2561,Osmund,Tallad,"And theres  always men about her, even in the Maidenvault.Men."
2562,Osmund,Tallad,"What men are these, pray tell?"
2563,Osmund,Tallad,Singers.
2564,Cersei,Osney,The Summer Islanders always  underfoot as well.Jalabhar Xho?
2565,Cersei,Robert,"Begging her for gold and swords to win his  homeland back, most like."
2566,Cersei,Robert,"No,"
2567,Margaery,Osmund,"No,Next year,I couldnt say if he was begging, Your Grace,Osney says hes  teaching them the Summer Tongue.Not Osney, the quee...the filly and her cousins.A horse that speaks the Summer Tongue would make a great sensation,Tell your brother to keep his spurs well honed.I shall find some way for him to mount his filly  soon, you may rely on that.Ill tell him, Your Grace."
2568,Margaery,Osmund,"Shes a pretty little  thing, that filly."
2569,Loras,Osney,Did you see?
2570,Loras,Osney,"I did it just the way Ser Loras said.Did you see, Ser  Osney?I did,A pretty sight.You have a better seat than me, sire,I broke the lance too.Ser Loras, did you hear it?As loud as a crack of thunder."
2571,Loras,Margaery,"You rode a splendid  course, but once is not enough."
2572,Loras,Margaery,"You must ride every day,  until every blow lands true and straight, and your lance is as much a part of you as your arm.I want to.You were glorious."
2573,Loras,Margaery,"Brother, take care,My gallant husband will be unhorsing  you in a few more years, I think.Tommen will be the champion, the champion, the champion.When he is a man grown,"
2574,Margaery,Tommen,"Mother, did you see me?"
2575,Margaery,Tommen,"I broke my lance on the shield, and the bag never hit me!I was watching from across the yard."
2576,Margaery,Tommen,"One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did.No man will stand before him."
2577,Margaery,Tommen,But I never  knew that King Robert was so accomplished at the joust.
2578,Cersei,Robert,I know the king should like to hear about his  fathers victories.
2579,Jaime,Margaery,"Robert won the tourney of the Trident,He overthrew Prince Rhaegar and named me his queen of love and beauty.I am surprised  you do not know that story, good-daughter."
2580,Loras,Margaery,"Ser  Osmund, help my son from his armor, if you would be so good."
2581,Loras,Margaery,I need  a word with you.
2582,Cersei,Loras,"Whose notion was that, pray?My sisters,Ser Tallad, Ser Dermot, and Ser Portifer were riding at the  quintain, and the queen suggested that His Grace might like to have a turn."
2583,Cersei,Loras,"And your part?I helped His Grace to don his armor and showed him how to couch his lance,That horse was much too large for him."
2584,Cersei,Loras,What if the sandbag had  smashed his head in?Bruises and bloody lips are all part of being a knight.I begin to understand why your brother is a cripple.
2585,Cersei,Loras,"Perhaps my brother failed to explain your duties to you, ser."
2586,Cersei,Loras,"Training him for knighthood is the province of the  master-at-arms.The Red Keep has had no master-at-arms since Aron Santagar was slain,His Grace is almost nine, and eager to learn."
2587,Cersei,Loras,Someone has to teach him.
2588,Cersei,Loras,"Pray, who did you squire for, ser?"
2589,Cersei,Tommen,"Lord Renly, was it not?I had that honor.Yes, I thought as much."
2590,Loras,Tommen,I have been remiss.
2591,Loras,Tommen,I shall rectify that error at once.
2592,Loras,Maegor,Your Grace will not  find any man half so skilled with sword and lance as I.
2593,Loras,Maegor,"Tommen is your king, not your squire."
2594,Loras,Maegor,No more.
2595,Cersei,Qyburn,"If it please  Your Grace, I have reports.More plots and treasons?"
2596,Cersei,Qyburn,I have had a long and tiring day.Tell me quickly.
2597,Cersei,Qyburn,As you wish.
2598,Cersei,Qyburn,  
2599,Daemon,Oberyn,"Do you have  any news of more import?The slave revolt in Astapor has spread to Meereen, it would seem.   It is harpies in Meereen."
2600,Daemon,Oberyn,Let the slaves revolt.
2601,Daemon,Oberyn,"Is that all you have for me?There is some news from Dorne that Your Grace may find of more interest.Prince Doran has  imprisoned Ser Daemon Sand, a bastard who once squired for the Red Viper.I recall him."
2602,Daemon,Oberyn,"What did he do?He demanded that Prince Oberyns daughters be set free.More fool him.Also,the daughter of the Knight of Spottswood was betrothed quite  unexpectedly to Lord Estermont, our friends in Dorne inform us.She was sent to Greenstone that  very night, and it is said she and Estermont have already wed.A bastard in the belly would explain that."
2603,Cersei,Robert,"How old is  the blushing bride?Three-and-twenty, Your Grace.  I am aware of that."
2604,Cersei,Jaime,Greenshit
2605,Cersei,Jaime,"Her father was good to me,and she and I would play together when the two of us were small."
2606,Joffrey,Robert,"No,I want him horned."
2607,Joffrey,Qyburn,"Eldon Estermont has taken a wife fifty years his junior,Why should that  concern me?"
2608,Joffrey,Qyburn,"I do not say it should... but Daemon Sand and this Santagar girl were both close  to Prince Dorans own daughter, Arianne, or so the Dornishmen would have us believe.Perhaps  it means little or less, but I thought Your Grace should know.Now I do."
2609,Joffrey,Qyburn,Do you have more?One more thing.A trifling matter.
2610,Cersei,Qyburn,"The puppet lions grow greedy and   arrogant as this treasonous tale proceeds, until they begin to devour their own subjects.When the  noble stag makes objection, the lions devour him as well, and roar that it is their right as the  mightiest of beasts.And is that the end of it?"
2611,Cersei,Qyburn,"No, Your Grace.At the end a dragon hatches from an egg and devours all of the lions."
2612,Cersei,Qyburn,Witless fools.Only cretins  would hazard their heads upon a wooden dragon.
2613,Cersei,Chett,"Send some of  your whisperers to these shows and make note of who attends.If any of them should be men of  note, I would know their names.What will be done with them, if I may be so bold?Any men of substance shall be fined."
2614,Cersei,Qyburn,"For the puppeteers, the axe.There are four."
2615,Cersei,Qyburn,   the queen said sharply.
2616,Cersei,Qyburn,exhausted.
2617,Daenerys,Reznak,
2618,Dorcas,Qyburn,But first I will have names.As you command.
2619,Cersei,Tommen,"Sweet sister,the king requires a word."
2620,Cersei,Jaime,Tommen?
2621,Jaime,Tommen,What is it now?
2622,Jaime,Tommen,"His Grace wants his white courser on the morrow,For his jousting lesson."
2623,Jaime,Tommen,"There will be no jousting.Yes, there will."
2624,Jaime,Tommen,"I have to ride every day.And you shall,once we have a proper master-at-arms to supervise your  training.I dont want a proper master-at-arms.I want Ser Loras.You make too much of that boy.Your little wife has filled your head with foolish notions of  his prowess, I know, but Osmund Kettleblack is thrice the knight that Loras is."
2625,Jaime,Loras,Not the Osmund Kettleblack I know.
2626,Jaime,Tommen,"I am sending for a Dornishman to train you,The Dornish are  the finest jousters in the realm.They are not,Anyway, I dont want any stupid Dornishman, I want Ser  Loras.I command it."
2627,Jaime,Margaery,Must I send for Pate?
2628,Loras,Margaery,"I am your mother.Yes, but Im the king."
2629,Jaime,Loras,"I want a kitten too,  and I dont want to eat beets."
2630,Jaime,Loras,"Tommen, come here."
2631,Jaime,Loras,Are you afraid?A king should not show fear.
2632,Jaime,Loras,"King or no, you are a little boy."
2633,Jaime,Tommen,"Isnt that so, ser?Very important duties."
2634,Jaime,Tommen,"Riding round the city walls, for an instance."
2635,Jaime,Tommen,"Can I still have a kitten?Perhaps,So long as I hear no more nonsense about jousting.Can you  promise me that?"
2636,Jaime,Tommen,Yes.Good.
2637,Jaime,Tommen,"My guests will be here shortly.When Im king in my own right,  Im going to outlaw beets."
2638,Jaime,Tommen,"Your Grace,I was wondering."
2639,Stannis,Tommen,"Guard  your tongue, or......or what?"
2640,Stannis,Tommen,Your bloody walls are fine.
2641,Loras,Stannis,"The walls are as strong as they  have ever been... but perchance Your Grace has forgotten that our friends of Highgarden are  inside the walls?I forget nothing,"
2642,Barristan,Loras,This is the first I have heard of a new master-at-arms.
2643,Barristan,Loras,  
2644,Barristan,Loras,You had best remind him of his duties.
2645,Arthur,Barristan,"He knows his duties, and theres no better lance..."
2646,Jaime,Tywin,Hes just a boy.
2647,Cersei,Jaime,When I want  your counsel I will ask for it.
2648,Cersei,Jaime,"I must needs dress.Your supper guests, I know."
2649,Cersei,Jaime,There are so many I lose track.
2650,Jaime,Joffrey,"Pining for what youve lost, brother?"
2651,Jaime,Joffrey,"I love you too, sweet sister."
2652,Jaime,Joffrey,A beautiful golden fool.
2653,Cersei,Joffrey,Get out.
2654,Cersei,Taena,"The smallfolk will love you more if you  are kind,"
2655,Balman,Falyse,"Sweet Falyse,"
2656,Balman,Falyse,How fares our Lady  Tanda?
2657,Balman,Falyse,Your Grace is good to ask.
2658,Daenerys,Reznak,
2659,Balman,Cersei,"I shall add my prayers to your own,Lord Qyburn tells me that Tanda was thrown from her horse.Her saddle girth burst whilst she was riding,The stableboy should  have seen the strap was worn.He has been chastised.Severely, I hope."
2660,Cersei,Jaime,"Will you have another cup of hippocras, Falyse?You were always fond of it, I seem to recall.It is so good of you to remember, Your Grace."
2661,Falyse,Jaime,"How was your journey?Uncomfortable,It rained most of the day.We thought to spend the night  at Rosby, but that young ward of Lord Gyles refused us hospitality."
2662,Falyse,Gyles,"Mark my  word, when Gyles dies that ill-born wretch will make off with his gold."
2663,Cersei,Gyles,"My  lady mother was aunt to his second wife, third cousin to Gyles himself."
2664,Balman,Cersei,"Lord Gyles  has been threatening to die for as long as I have known him, but he is still with us, and will be for  many years, I do hope."
2665,Balman,Cersei,"No doubt he will cough the whole lot of us into  our graves.Like as not,Rosbys ward was not the only one to vex us, Your Grace."
2666,Cersei,Falyse,"Some had stars sewn on their jerkins, sacred stars of seven points, but they had an evil look  about them all the same.They were lice-ridden, I am certain,They call themselves sparrows,A plague upon the land."
2667,Cersei,Falyse,"If not, I shall deal with them myself.Has His High Holiness been chosen yet?"
2668,Balman,Falyse,"No,Septon Ollidor was on the verge of being chosen, until some  of these sparrows followed him to a brothel and dragged him naked out into the street.Luceon  seems the likely choice now, though our friends on the other hill say that he is still a few votes  short of the required number.May the Crone guide the deliberations with her golden lamp of wisdom,"
2669,Balman,Lollys,"Your Grace, an awkward matter, but... lest bad feeling fester  between us, you should know that neither my good wife nor her mother had any hand in the   naming of this bastard child."
2670,Balman,Lollys,He laughed.
2671,Falyse,Tanda,"Tyrion was a kings name before the dragons came.The Imp has despoiled it, but  perhaps this child can restore the name to honor."
2672,Falyse,Tanda,I know you are  not to blame. Her voice broke.
2673,Balman,Cersei,"In... in fear, Your Grace?I have not slept a whole night through since Joffrey died."
2674,Balman,Cersei,"My friends... you are my friends, I hope?And King Tommens?That sweet lad,Your Grace, the very words of House Stokeworth are  Proud to Be Faithful.Would that there were more like you, good ser.I tell you truly, I have grave doubts about Ser  Bronn of the Blackwater."
2675,Balman,Falyse,"The man is insolent, Your Grace,Uncouth  and foul-mouthed.He is no true knight,No."
2676,Balman,Cersei,"And you are a man who would know true knighthood.I  remember watching you joust in... which tourney was it where you fought so brilliantly, ser?"
2677,Balman,Cersei,That affair at Duskendale six years ago?
2678,Balman,Cersei,  
2679,Balman,Cersei,"The Imp vanished the night my father died,  leaving two honest gaolers behind in pools of blood."
2680,Balman,Cersei,Perhaps  some friend is hiding him.Bronn?
2681,Balman,Cersei,"He was ever the Imps creature.Only the Stranger knows how many men hes sent to hell at  Tyrions behest.Your Grace, I think I should have noticed a dwarf skulking about our lands,My brother is small.He was made for skulking."
2682,Cersei,Falyse,"A childs name is  a small thing... but insolence unpunished breeds rebellion.And this man Bronn has been  gathering sellswords to him, Qyburn has told me.He has taken four knights into his household,"
2683,Balman,Bronn,"My good wife flatters them, to call them knights.Theyre upjumped  sellswords, with not a thimble of chivalry to be found amongst the four of them.As I feared."
2684,Balman,Cersei,The  Imp will kill him as he killed his brother.
2685,Balman,Cersei,"My friends, I put my honor in your  hands... but what is a queens honor against a mothers fears?Say on, Your Grace,Your words shall neer leave this room."
2686,Balman,Cersei,"I...I would sleep more easily of a  night if I were to hear that Ser Bronn had suffered a... a mishap... whilst hunting, perhaps."
2687,Balman,Cersei,A mortal mishap?
2688,Balman,Cersei,"I beg you, ser,do not make me say it...I understand."
2689,Cersei,Falyse,"You are a true knight indeed, ser.The answer to a  frightened mothers prayers."
2690,Cersei,Falyse,"Do it quickly, if you would.Bronn has only a  few men about him now, but if we do not act, he will surely gather more."
2691,Cersei,Falyse,"I  shall never forget this, my friends."
2692,Cersei,Falyse,"You  have my word, we shall find Lollys a better husband when this is done."
2693,Cersei,Falyse,We Lannisters pay our debts.
2694,Cersei,Meryn,Where did those come  from?
2695,Margaery,Meryn,"The little queen gave them to him.She only meant to give him one, but he couldnt decide  which one he liked the best."
2696,Cersei,Jaime,"Never speak of it, child,Not until His Grace agrees to the betrothal.It must remain our secret for now."
2697,Cersei,Mag,"You must be especially beautiful,for at  the final feast it shall be announced that you and Prince Rhaegar are betrothed."
2698,Aerys,Tywin,"Your father proposed the match,"
2699,Jaime,Tywin,"Your father will find another man for you, a better man than  Rhaegar."
2700,Brienne,Hyle,"Tarly will want them for the  walls,We have no tar,The flesh will rot.Leave them."
2701,Hyle,Randyll,"Bury them,"
2702,Brienne,Randyll,"The stammering squire threw a rock,"
2703,Brienne,Randyll,The swordswench  did the rest.All three?
2704,Brienne,Randyll,"The way she fought, she could have killed three more.And did you find the Stark girl?"
2705,Brienne,Randyll,"No, my lord.Instead you slew some rats.Did you enjoy it?No, my lord.A pity."
2706,Pyg,Timeon,"Ill have you on it.Thank you, my lord, but no."
2707,Pyg,Shagwell,"You mean  to continue with this folly?I mean to find the Lady Sansa.If it please my lord,I watched her fight the Mummers.She is stronger than  most men, and quick...The sword is quick,That is the nature of Valyrian steel."
2708,Beric,Brienne,"Shes a freak of nature, far be it from me to deny it."
2709,Beric,Brienne,"My lord, it may be that  Sandor Clegane has some knowledge of the girl.  "
2710,Beric,Brienne,"Clegane,  Dondarrion, the red priest, and now this woman Stoneheart... how do you propose to find them,  when I cannot?My lord, I...All I can do is try.Try, then."
2711,Brienne,Randyll,You can crawl back to Tarth with some dogs  bastard in your belly.
2712,Brienne,Randyll,"If it please my lord, how many men ride with the Hound?Six or sixty or six hundred.It would seem to depend on whom we ask."
2713,Hyle,Randyll,If my squire and I might beg your hospitality until...Beg all you want.
2714,Hyle,Randyll,"If it please my lord, I had understood that it was still Lord  Mootons roof."
2715,Hyle,Randyll,Mooton has the courage of a worm.
2716,Brienne,Hyle,"Live or die, Lady Brienne, do not return to Maidenpool whilst I rule here."
2717,Brienne,Hyle,"As you  command, my lord,"
2718,Alyn,Hyle,There are inns.
2719,Alyn,Hyle,Do you recall the Stinking Goose?
2720,Alyn,Hyle,"Why?Meet me there on the morrow, at midday."
2721,Alyn,Hyle,"Ill speak with him.Why would you do that?Why not?If you succeed where Alyn failed, I shall be able to taunt him with that for years."
2722,Podrick,Randyll,Ser?My lady?
2723,Podrick,Randyll,There are ships.
2724,Podrick,Randyll,Or bunks.
2725,Brienne,Podrick,"Gulltown next,"
2726,Brienne,Podrick,Is mlady seeking passage north?No.
2727,Daenerys,Reznak,
2728,Brienne,Podrick,Lady Sansa.They burned her home.Still.
2729,Brienne,Podrick,And gods cant die.
2730,Brienne,Podrick,"Timeon was a cruel man and a murderer, but I do not think he  lied about the Hound."
2731,Brienne,Podrick,There will be other ships.
2732,Brienne,Podrick,Youre the  big one went off with Nimble Dick.
2733,Brienne,Podrick,He cheat you?No.Rape you?No.Steal your horse?No.He was slain by outlaws.Outlaws?
2734,Brienne,Podrick,"I always figured Dick would hang,  or get sent off to that Wall."
2735,Brienne,Hyle,"My lady.Podrick.Gods, I hope you  did not eat the food here.What we ate is no concern of yours,Did you find your cousin?What did he  tell you?Sandor Clegane was last seen in Saltpans, the day of the raid.Afterward he rode west, along  the Trident."
2736,Brienne,Hyle,"The Trident is a long river.Aye, but I dont think our dog will have wandered too far from its mouth."
2737,Brienne,Hyle,At Saltpans he was looking for a ship.
2738,Harren,Hyle,"The  Hound butchered three of his brothers men at the old inn by the crossroads, here.He led the raid  on Saltpans, here."
2739,Harren,Hyle,He may be trapped.
2740,Alyn,Randyll,Wheres a dog to go?If he is with Dondarrion...?Hes not.
2741,Beric,Brienne,"Supposedly she was hanged by the Freys, but Dondarrion kissed her and brought her back to  life, and now she cannot die, no more than he can."
2742,Brienne,Hyle,"If Clegane was  last seen at Saltpans, that would be the place to find his trail.There is no one left at Saltpans but an old knight hiding in his castle, Alyn said.Still, it would be a place to start.Theres a man,A septon."
2743,Brienne,Meribald,We should go with  him.
2744,Brienne,Meribald,"We?I am going with you.Youre not.Well, Im going with Septon Meribald to Saltpans.You and Podrick can go wherever you  bloody well like.Did Lord Randyll command you to follow me again?He commanded me to stay away from you.Lord Randyll is of the view that you might benefit  from a good hard raping.Then why would you come with me?It was that, or return to gate duty.If your lord commanded...He is no longer my lord."
2745,Brienne,Hyle,"You left his service?His lordship informed me that he had no further need of my sword, or my insolence."
2746,Brienne,Hyle,"Henceforth I shall enjoy the adventuresome life of a hedge knight...  though if we do find Sansa Stark, I imagine we will be well rewarded."
2747,Brienne,Hyle,"I mean to save the girl, not sell her.I swore a vow.I dont recall that I did.That is why you will not be coming with me."
2748,Brienne,Meribald,"Food for the poor and hungry of the riverlands,Seeds and nuts and dried fruit, oaten  porridge, flour, barley bread, three wheels of yellow cheese from the inn by the Fools Gate, salt  cod for me, salt mutton for Dog... oh, and salt."
2749,Brienne,Meribald,"I got these from a  sailor, and I fear they will be the last Ill taste till spring."
2750,Chett,Meribald,"There are many  fine hedges in the riverlands,The old ones are the best."
2751,Chett,Meribald,"Inside one of those a man can sleep as snug as at an inn, and with less  fear of fleas."
2752,Brienne,Podrick,"I have not worn a shoe in twenty years,The first year, I had more blisters  than I had toes, and my soles would bleed like pigs whenever I trod on a hard stone, but I prayed  and the Cobbler Above turned my skin to leather.There is no cobbler above,There is, lad... though you may call him by another name.Tell me, which of the seven gods do  you love best?The Warrior,"
2753,Brienne,Meribald,"At Evenfall my fathers septon always said that there was but one  god.One god with seven aspects.Thats so, my lady, and you are right to point it out, but the  mystery of the Seven Who Are One is not easy for simple folk to grasp, and I am nothing if not  simple, so I speak of seven gods."
2754,Meribald,Podrick,I have never known a boy  who did not love the Warrior.
2755,Brienne,Chett,"It was he who heard my prayer and healed my feet.The gods are good,but why trouble them, when you might just  have kept your shoes?Going barefoot was my penance."
2756,Brienne,Hyle,It shames me to think of all the maidens I  deflowered.
2757,Hyle,Podrick,"Were looking for a maiden,A highborn girl of three-and-ten, with  auburn hair.I had understood that you were seeking outlaws.Them too,Most travelers do all they can to avoid such men,yet you would seek  them out.We only seek one outlaw,Sandor.So Ser Hyle told me."
2758,Brienne,Sansa,What  would good folk want with such a creature?The maid that Podrick spoke of may be with him.Truly?Then we must pray for the poor girl.
2759,Hyle,Podrick,"It would seem the gods walk with us... at least the Maiden, the Mother, and  the Crone."
2760,Brienne,Podrick,"These people  live less than a days ride from Maidenpool, and yet the fighting has not touched them.They have little to touch, my lady."
2761,Brienne,Podrick,"They know  Lord Mooton rules their lands, but few have ever seen him, and Riverrun and Kings Landing are  only names to them.And yet they know the gods,That is your work, I think.How long have you  walked the riverlands?It will be forty years soon,From Maidenpool  to Maidenpool, my circuit takes me half a year and ofttimes more, but I will not say I know the  Trident."
2762,Brienne,Hyle,"And the roads the smallfolk use, the  crooked muddy tracks that do not appear on parchment maps, I know them too."
2763,Brienne,Hyle,"I  should.My feet have trod every mile of them, ten times over."
2764,Hyle,Podrick,"It must make for a lonely life, septon.The Seven are always with me,and I have my faithful servant, and Dog.Does your dog have a name?"
2765,Hyle,Podrick,"He must,but he is not my dog."
2766,Hyle,Podrick,Who does he belong to?
2767,Hyle,Podrick,"Why, to himself, and to the Seven."
2768,Hyle,Podrick,I call him  Dog.Oh.
2769,Daenerys,Reznak,I used to have a dog when I was little.
2770,Hyle,Podrick,"He died.Dog keeps me safe upon the roads, even in such trying times as these.Neither wolf nor outlaw  dare molest me when Dog is at my side."
2771,Hyle,Podrick,The wolves have grown terrible  of late.
2772,Hyle,Podrick,"In all my  years the biggest pack I ever saw had fewer than a dozen wolves in it, but the great pack that  prowls along the Trident now numbers in the hundreds.Have you come on them yourself?"
2773,Hyle,Podrick,"I have been spared that, Seven save me, but I have heard them in the night, and more than  once."
2774,Hyle,Podrick,"It even set Dog to shivering, and Dog  has killed a dozen wolves."
2775,Hyle,Podrick,Some will tell you that they are demons.
2776,Hyle,Podrick,"They will tell you that she has been known to bring aurochs down all by herself, that no trap nor  snare can hold her, that she fears neither steel nor fire, slays any wolf that tries to mount her, and  devours no other flesh but man."
2777,Hyle,Podrick,"Now youve done it, septon.Poor Podricks eyes are big as boiled  eggs.Theyre not,"
2778,Meribald,Podrick,"The  tides out, ser."
2779,Meribald,Podrick,"Theres no water, only mudflats.Stay off the mud, child,The mud is not fond of strangers.If you  walk in the wrong place, it will open up and swallow you.Its only mud,Until it fills your mouth and starts creeping up your nose.Then its death."
2780,Meribald,Podrick,"Wipe off that mud and have a slice of orange, lad."
2781,Daenerys,Reznak,"We would do well to keep a watch tonight, my friends."
2782,Hyle,Podrick,"Three is honey to our swordswench.Theyre not like to  trouble armed men.Unless theyre starving,There is food in these marshes, but only for those  with the eyes to find it, and these men are strangers here, survivors from some battle.If they  should accost us, ser, I beg you, leave them to me.What will you do with them?Feed them."
2783,Hyle,Podrick,"Invite them to come  with us to the Quiet Isle.Thats as good as inviting them to slit our throats as we sleep,Lord  Randyll has better ways to deal with broken men...steel and hempen rope.Ser?My lady?"
2784,Brienne,Podrick,"Is a broken man an outlaw?More or less,"
2785,Brienne,Meribald,More less than more.
2786,Chett,Jacelyn,"Then they get a taste of battle.For some, that one taste is enough to break them."
2787,Chett,Jacelyn,"They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his  now."
2788,Chett,Jacelyn,"If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take  them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk  whose lands theyre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be."
2789,Daenerys,Reznak,And the man breaks.
2790,Brienne,Meribald,"In times like  these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them... but he should pity them as well."
2791,Meribald,Willam,"How old were you  when they marched you off to war?Why, no older than your boy,Too young for such, in truth, but my  brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind."
2792,Hyle,Robin,"Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.The War of the Ninepenny Kings?"
2793,Hyle,Robin,"So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny."
2794,Hyle,Robin,That it  was.
2795,Gilly,Samwell,"He promised hed be back,You heard him too."
2796,Dareon,Samwell,"He doesnt like it here with us,Its sad here.He likes it where the wine is, and the smiles."
2797,Moon,Samwell,"You should have asked her for silver,Its coin  we need, not kisses."
2798,Dareon,Samwell,"Some kisses are worth more than yellow gold,  Slayer."
2799,Gilly,Samwell,"All that weeping makes me want to slap her,and I can scarce sleep  for her sobbing."
2800,Aemon,Gilly,"When you raised him up to be the lord commander,"
2801,Aemon,Gilly,Egg?
2802,Aemon,Gilly,Why is it so dark?
2803,Aemon,Samwell,"Its me,Samwell Tarly.Your steward.SamwellYes."
2804,Aemon,Samwell,"Forgive me,  Samwell Is morning come?No."
2805,Aemon,Samwell,"Its night, maester.Youve been asleep.Too long.Its cold in here.We have no wood,and the innkeep will not give us more unless we have the  coin."
2806,Aemon,Samwell,"This may help gentle his passing,"
2807,Aemon,Samwell,"Ointments I have, potions and infusions, tinctures and venoms and poultices."
2808,Aemon,Samwell,Give him this and let him sleep.
2809,Aemon,Dareon,We must go  down to the ships.
2810,Aemon,Dareon,"Youre too weak to go out,"
2811,Aemon,Samwell,"On the morrow we can go to the docks,You can ask about and find which  ship is departing next for Oldtown."
2812,Aemon,Samwell,"Oldtown,Yes."
2813,Aemon,Samwell,We were drinking in the old inn  where they make the fearsomely strong cider.
2814,Aemon,Samwell,"The ships,We will find our  answer there."
2815,Aemon,Samwell,I need to know.
2816,Aemon,Samwell,"Are you hungry, maester?We have some bread left, and a bit of cheese.Not just now, Samwell Later, when Im feeling stronger.How will you get stronger unless you eat?"
2817,Aemon,Samwell,"The breads gone stale, but I can beg some gravy from the kitchens to soak it in,"
2818,Dareon,Samwell,"No.Perhaps a sip of wine, though?"
2819,Dareon,Samwell,"Well  have wine later,Theres water, but its not the good water."
2820,Aemon,Samwell,"All we have is canal  water,but the cook gave it a boil."
2821,Aemon,Samwell,"Help me, if you would."
2822,Aemon,Dareon,"Enough,Youll drown  me."
2823,Aemon,Dareon,Why is the room so cold?Theres no more wood.
2824,Aemon,Chett,"We must go to the docks,  SamwellWhen you are stronger."
2825,Dareon,Samwell,"It would be too great a strain on you.Then go in my stead,and bring me someone who has seen these dragons.Me?"
2826,Dareon,Samwell,"Maester, it was only a story.A sailors story."
2827,Dareon,Samwell,Dareon may have made up the whole  story.
2828,Dareon,Samwell,"They make things up.They do,but even the most fanciful song may hold a kernel of truth.Find that truth for me, Samwell"
2829,Chett,Samwell,  
2830,Chett,Samwell,  I know that now.
2831,Chett,Samwell,I will be with my brothers soon.
2832,Aemon,Samwell,"The septons sing of sweet surcease, of laying down  our burdens and voyaging to a far sweet land where we may laugh and love and feast until the   end of days... but what if there is no land of light and honey, only cold and dark and pain beyond  the wall called death?"
2833,Aemon,Samwell,You are not dying.
2834,Aemon,Samwell,"It will pass.Not this time, Samwell I dreamed... in the black of night a man asks all the questions he dare not  ask by daylight."
2835,Aemon,Samwell,What  use could they have for an old done man like me?
2836,Aemon,Samwell,"I remember, Samwell I still remember."
2837,Aemon,Samwell,"Remember what?Dragons,The grief and glory of my House, they were.The last dragon died before you were born,How could you remember them?I see them in my dreams, Samwell I see a red star bleeding in the sky."
2838,Aemon,Samwell,  said Samwell  
2839,Aemon,Samwell,"Or I am an old man, feverish and dying."
2840,Aemon,Samwell,I should not have left the Wall.
2841,Dareon,Samwell,"Go down to  the ships, Samwell Learn all you can about these dragons."
2842,Dareon,Samwell,I will.
2843,Daenerys,Reznak,
2844,Dareon,Gilly,Well.
2845,Gilly,Samwell,"Gilly, bar the door  when I am gone."
2846,Dareon,Samwell,"I am sorry,I do not understand."
2847,Chett,Samwell,"My friend Terro says you are so fat you make him sick,My friend Terro says that  the rattle of your sword makes his head ache."
2848,Daenerys,Reznak,My friend Terro says you dress above your station.
2849,Chett,Samwell,"Im not...He is not a lord,Hes in the Nights Watch, stupid.From Westeros."
2850,Chett,Samwell,"Theres another one down at the Happy Port, singing songs  to the Sailors Wife,"
2851,Chett,Samwell,"I sold all my oysters.I have no coin,He has no coin,"
2852,Chett,Samwell,"My friend Terro is chilly.Be our good fat friend and give him your  cloak.Dont do that either,or else theyll ask for your boots next, and before  long youll be naked.Little cats who howl too loud get drowned in the canals,Not if they have claws."
2853,Chett,Samwell,"Thank you,"
2854,Chett,Samwell,If you wear a sword at night it means you can be challenged.Did you  want to fight them?No.
2855,Chett,Samwell,Are you truly in the Nights Watch?I never saw a black brother like you before.
2856,Chett,Samwell,You can have the last clams if you want.
2857,Chett,Samwell,Are you sailing to the Wall?To Oldtown.
2858,Chett,Samwell,Were between ships.
2859,Dareon,Samwell,The bravos never bother anyone without a sword.Not even stupid camel cunts like Terro and  Orbelo.Who are you?No one.
2860,Dareon,Samwell,"I used to be someone, but now Im not."
2861,Dareon,Samwell,"Who are you?Samwell, of House Tarly.You speak the Common Tongue.My father was the oarmaster on Nymeria."
2862,Dareon,Samwell,Brusco took me in and gave me a barrow.
2863,Dareon,Samwell,What ship will you be sailing  on?We bought passage on the Lady Ushanora.
2864,Dareon,Samwell,Shes gone.
2865,Dareon,Samwell,She left days and days  ago.
2866,Dareon,Samwell,"Well,thats done."
2867,Dareon,Samwell,"Three days I have  waited for this old man,My holds are full, and my men have fucked their  wives farewell.With you or without, my Lady leaves on the tide.Please,Just a few more days, thats all I ask.So Maester Aemon can  recover his strength.He has no strength."
2868,Aemon,Samwell,He is old and ill and I will not have him dying on my Lady.
2869,Aemon,Samwell,I sail.
2870,Aemon,Samwell,You bought my finest  cabin.
2871,Dareon,Samwell,Why  should I bear the loss?
2872,Dareon,Samwell,You said you saw a singer...At the Happy Port.
2873,Dareon,Samwell,I have to go.
2874,Dareon,Samwell,"Dont,Im not here for that."
2875,Dareon,Samwell,"I do  not speak that tongue,"
2876,Dareon,Samwell,Dont do  that!Im not here for that!Sam!
2877,Dareon,Samwell,"Yna, let him go, thats Samwellthe Slayer.My Sworn  Brother!"
2878,Dareon,Samwell,"He can slay me if he likes,Do you think hed let me touch his  sword?"
2879,Dareon,Samwell,"Slayer,come meet my lady wife."
2880,Dareon,Samwell,I sang her love songs.
2881,Dareon,Samwell,How could I  resist this face?
2882,Dareon,Samwell,"Wife, give Slayer a kiss, hes my brother."
2883,Dareon,Samwell,"Dont go fondling my wife  now, Slayer,But if you want one of her sisters, you feel free.I still  have coin enough, I think."
2884,Aemon,Samwell,What have you done?
2885,Aemon,Samwell,"They could have your head for this.Were only wed for this one night, Slayer."
2886,Aemon,Samwell,Havent you ever gone to Moles Town to dig for buried treasure?No.
2887,Aemon,Samwell,I would never...
2888,Dareon,Samwell,"All those nights  in the woods, huddled together under your cloak, dont you tell me that you never stuck it in  her."
2889,Dareon,Samwell,"Sit down, Slayer."
2890,Dareon,Samwell,Have both.
2891,Dareon,Samwell,You promised to come back before the gloaming.To bring  back wine and food.Is this how you killed that Other?Scolding him to death?
2892,Aemon,Dareon,"Shes my wife,  not you.If you will not drink to my marriage, go away.Come with me,"
2893,Dareon,Samwell,Help me.On the morrow.Not on my wedding night.
2894,Dareon,Samwell,"You promised, Dareon."
2895,Dareon,Samwell,Youre supposed to be my  brother.In Westeros.Does this look like Westeros to you?Maester Aemon......is dying.
2896,Dareon,Samwell,"Have a girl or go away, Samwell Youre ruining my wedding.Ill go,but youll come with me.No."
2897,Dareon,Samwell,Im done with black.
2898,Dareon,Samwell,Here.
2899,Daenerys,Reznak,
2900,Samwell,Xhondo,"Stop that,I havent drowned.I havent drowned.No."
2901,Samwell,Xhondo,You owe Xhondo many  feathers.The water ruined Xhondos fine cloak.
2902,Samwell,Xhondo,I never meant...
2903,Samwell,Xhondo,Fat men should float.
2904,Samwell,Xhondo,Xhondo mates on Cinnamon  Wind.
2905,Samwell,Xhondo,And  Xhondo hears.
2906,Samwell,Xhondo,Xhondo knows these dragons.
2907,Cersei,Xhondo,I had hoped that by now you would have grown tired of that wretched beard.All that  hair makes you look like Robert.
2908,Cersei,Lancel,Roberts beard was black.Mine is gold.Gold?Or silver?
2909,Cersei,Lancel,"All  the color is draining out of you, brother."
2910,Cersei,Lancel,"And so bloodless, always in white."
2911,Cersei,Lancel,I prefer you  garbed in crimson and gold.
2912,Daenerys,Reznak,I will make a bargain with you.
2913,Cersei,Jaime,"You  presume to dicker with me?Need I remind you, you are sworn to obey.I am sworn to protect the king.My place is at his side.Your place is wherever he sends you.Tommen puts his seal on every paper that you put in front of him."
2914,Cersei,Jaime,Why name Daven your Warden of the West if you have no faith in him?
2915,Cersei,Jaime,"Why so reluctant, ser?Did you lose your courage with your hand?I swore an oath to Lady Stark, never again to take up arms against the Starks or Tullys.A drunken promise made with a sword at your throat.How can I defend Tommen if I am not with him?By defeating his enemies."
2916,Harren,Jaime,"We have urgent need of Wylis Manderly, assuming he is still alive and  captive, but the garrison has not replied to any of our ravens.Those are Gregors men at Harrenhal,Gregor liked them cruel  and stupid.Most like they ate your ravens, messages and all.Thats why Im sending you.They may eat you as well, brave brother, but I trust youll give  them indigestion."
2917,Cersei,Lancel,I want Ser Osmund to command the Kingsguard  in your absence.Thats  not your choice.   
2918,Cersei,Jaime,"And I will not have Loras  Tyrell commanding the Kingsguard.Ser Loras is thrice the man Ser Osmund is.Your notions of manhood have changed somewhat, brother."
2919,Cersei,Jaime,"True, Loras does not leer at your teats the way Ser Osmund does,  but I hardly think...Think about this."
2920,Cersei,Jaime,"I see I need a thicker beard, to cushion me against  my queens caresses."
2921,Lancel,Osmund,"You had best go, ser.Are you deaf as well as maimed?"
2922,Addam,Cersei,"The smallest council,"
2923,Cersei,Jaime,"Qyburn stinks of secrets,"
2924,Cersei,Lancel,"We all have secrets, brother,"
2925,Conn,Ronnet,"Keep friends at your back and foes where you can see them,"
2926,Ilyn,Jaime,"My lord,will you be wanting  your new hand?Wear it, Jaime,Wave at the smallfolk and give them a tale to  tell their children.I think not."
2927,Ilyn,Jaime,"But feel free to make up for my lack, Ser Kennos.Wave with both hands, and  waggle your feet if it please you."
2928,Ilyn,Jaime,"Payne,youll ride beside me."
2929,Addam,Cersei,"I  need them,"
2930,Aerys,Mace,"Open the gates,OPEN THE  GATES!"
2931,Ilyn,Jaime,"They like the smell of roses but  have no love for lions,My sister would be wise to take note of that."
2932,Gregor,Jaime,"Robb Stark took me unawares in the  Whispering Wood,That will never happen again.You have my word on it."
2933,Gregor,Jaime,"If any foe  should come within a dozen leagues, you will know of them beforehand."
2934,Joffrey,Stannis,"Antler Men,drop of dragon"
2935,Ilyn,Jaime,"His Grace bids me win back his riverlands,I would have you with me... if you can bear to give up all of this."
2936,Conn,Ronnet,"I suppose I ought to wear the  hand,"
2937,Conn,Jaime,"Men shall name you Goldenhand from this day forth, my lord,"
2938,Chett,Jaime,"If you admire the bloody  thing so much, lop off your own sword hand and you can have it,"
2939,Chett,Jaime,Has there been no word of our Lord Tyrek?
2940,Chett,Jaime,None.
2941,Chett,Jaime,"I led a search myself, at Lord Tywins command,"
2942,Jaime,Robert,"The  mob let the other corpses lie, why not his?He would be of more value alive,Any Lannister would bring a hefty  ransom.No doubt,yet no ransom demand was ever made."
2943,Jaime,Robert,"If they  realized whom theyd killed, no doubt they threw him in the river for fear of my fathers wrath."
2944,Jaime,Robert,"Lord Tywin always paid his debts.Always,"
2945,Ilyn,Jaime,"Its time,"
2946,Ilyn,Jaime,"You were a knight once, ser,So was I.Let us see what we are now."
2947,Ilyn,Jaime,"We will dance again,On the morrow, and  the morrow.Every day well dance, till I am as good with my left hand as ever I was with the  right."
2948,Ilyn,Jaime,"They have lusty wenches in House Hayford.These are love bites, lad."
2949,Chett,Jaime,"No beast would be so bold,These are demons in the skins of wolves, sent to chastise us for our  sins.This must have been an uncommonly sinful horse,"
2950,Chett,Jaime,"We had some trouble with a  band of them white star wolves,They come round sniffing after you,  my lord, but we saw them off, and buried three down by the turnips."
2951,Chett,Jaime,"The one who led them had a manticore on his  shield.Ser Amory Lorch,My lord father commanded him to harry the riverlands.Which were no part of,My fealtys owed to House Hayford,  and Lady Ermesande bends her little knee at Kings Landing, or will when shes old enough to  walk."
2952,Harren,Jaime,"What should we do, my lord?Plant,and pray for one last harvest."
2953,Harren,Jaime,sort out
2954,Gregor,Jaime,"Fuck me, Jaime Lannister,Its the bleeding Kingslayer, boys.Fuck me with a spear!Who might you be?"
2955,Gregor,Jaime,"Ser used to call me Shitmouth, if it please mlord."
2956,Ilyn,Jaime,Charming.Do you command here?Me?
2957,Ilyn,Jaime,Bugger me with a bloody spear.
2958,Ilyn,Jaime,"Bugger  me with a bloody spear,You heard the man,Find a nice long spear, and shove it up his  arse."
2959,Jaime,Jon,"You keep that bloody thing away from me.Make up your mind,Who has the command here?Did Ser Gregor name a  castellan?Polliver,only the Hound killed him, mlord."
2960,Jaime,Sandor,"You know it was Sandor?You saw him?Not us, mlord.That innkeep told us.It happened at the crossroads inn, my lord."
2961,Sandor,Vargo,The innkeep swore the man had one side of his face all burned.
2962,Jaime,Sandor,"They hacked  Polly and the Tickler to bloody bits and rode off down the Trident, we were told.Did you send men after them?"
2963,Jaime,Sandor,"No, mlord.Fuck us all, we never did.When a dog goes mad you cut his throat.Well,I never much liked Polly, that shit, and the dog, he  were Sers brother, so...Were bad, mlord,but youd need to be mad to face  the Hound."
2964,Jaime,Sandor,"You were afraid  of him.I wouldnt say afraid, mlord."
2965,Jaime,Sandor,Or you.
2966,Jaime,Sandor,"You have a name?Rafford, if it pleases.Most call me Raff.Raff, gather the garrison together in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths."
2967,Jaime,Sandor,Id like to look upon his head.
2968,Chett,Jaime,Where is the rest of him?
2969,Daenerys,Reznak,"Rotted, ser. Rafford admitted, "
2970,Chett,Jaime,"Ser took his hands and feet first,  then his arms and legs.The fat bugger got most, mlord,"
2971,Gregor,Jaime,"That whoreson ud slobber when we fed him,  and the greased run down into that skinny beard o his."
2972,Gregor,Jaime,Take this and throw it in the lake.
2973,Gregor,Jaime,"Until such time as Lord Petyr arrives to claim  his seat, Ser Bonifer Hasty shall hold Harrenhal in the name of the crown."
2974,Gregor,Jaime,The rest will ride with me to Riverrun.
2975,Gregor,Jaime,"Were owed,Ser promised us.Rich  rewards, he said.His very words,Rich rewards, for them as rides with me."
2976,Gregor,Jaime,"Any man who remains with me shall have a hide of land to  work, a second hide when he takes a wife, a third at the birth of his first child.Land, ser?"
2977,Jaime,Rafford,Piss on that.
2978,Jaime,Rafford,"Meaning gold.If you have a grievance, go to Kings Landing and take it up with my sweet sister."
2979,Jaime,Rafford,Ill see those captives now.Starting with Ser Wylis Manderly.He the fat one?
2980,Jaime,Rafford,"I devoutly hope so.And tell me no sad stories of how he died, or the lot of you are apt to do  the same."
2981,Jaime,Wyl,"No one will hurt you  now,"
2982,Harren,Jaime,Anything but goat.
2983,Harren,Jaime,"I want none of Ser Gregors followers,I will not have such sinners in my service.My septon used to say all men were sinners.He was not wrong,but some sins are blacker than others, and fouler in  the nostrils of the Seven."
2984,Pia,Qyburn,Very well.Ill take Gregors lot off your hands.
2985,Pia,Qyburn,"Take the whore as well,You know the one.The girl from the dungeons.Pia."
2986,Cersei,Jaime,"Pia was born in this castle,It is the only home she has  ever known.She is a font of corruption,I wont have her near my men, flaunting her...parts.I expect her flaunting days are done,but if you find her that objectionable, Ill take  her."
2987,Cersei,Jaime,Can you hold Harrenhal with just your Holy Hundred?
2988,Harren,Jaime,"I anticipate no difficulty.The Crone will light our way, and the Warrior will give strength to  our arms."
2989,Roose,Vargo,the Good
2990,Cersei,Harren,"This castle has an ill repute,"
2991,Gregor,Harren,"Those who look upon them burst into  flame.I fear no shade, ser.It is written in The Seven-Pointed Star that spirits, wights, and revenants  cannot harm a pious man, so long as he is armored in his faith.Then armor yourself in faith, by all means, but wear a suit of mail and plate as well."
2992,Gregor,Harren,  
2993,Jaime,Randyll,"Once that is done, the Seven will guide the goodfolk back to their villages to plow and plant and  build anew."
2994,Jaime,Zollo,"If any of Hoats Brave Companions fall into your hands, send word to me at once."
2995,Rorge,Shagwell,"So you can torture them and kill them?I suppose you would forgive them, in my place?If they made sincere repentance for their sins... yes, I would embrace them all as brothers and  pray with them before I sent them to the block."
2996,Jaime,Rorge,Crimes require  punishment.
2997,Jaime,Rorge,"If it is Sandor Clegane that we encounter, what would you have me  do?"
2998,Jaime,Rorge,Send him to join his beloved brother and be glad the gods  made seven hells.One would never be enough to hold both of the Cleganes.
2999,Jaime,Rorge,Beric Dondarrion is a different matter.
3000,Jaime,Rorge,"Ill want to march him back to Kings Landing with a rope about his neck, and  have Ser Ilyn take his head off where half the realm can see.And this Myrish priest who runs with him?It is said he spreads his false faith everywhere.Kill him, kiss him, or pray with him, as you please.I have no wish to kiss the man, my lord.No doubt hed say the same of you."
3001,Jaime,Lyle,"My pardons.I shall  take my leave of you, if you have no objections.None, my lord,"
3002,Jaime,Ronnet,"Ser Ronnet,have you lost  your way?"
3003,Jaime,Ronnet,I wished to see where the bear danced with the maiden not-so- fair.
3004,Jaime,Ronnet,Is it  true the wench fought naked?Naked?No.
3005,Conn,Jaime,The Mummers put  her in a pink silk gown and shoved a tourney sword into her hand.
3006,Conn,Jaime,  
3007,Conn,Jaime,You speak as if you know the lady.I was betrothed to her.
3008,Brienne,Conn,"Her father made a match  for her...Thrice,I was the second."
3009,Jaime,Ronnet,"I had heard the wench was  ugly, and I told him so, but he said all women were the same once you blew the candle out.Your father."
3010,Conn,Jon,"Our late Hands... brother, was he?Cousin.Lord Jon had no brothers.No."
3011,Jaime,Ronnet,How is it that you did not wed?
3012,Jaime,Ronnet,"Why, I went to Tarth and saw her."
3013,Conn,Jaime,I gave her a rose and told her it was all that she would ever  have from me.
3014,Conn,Jaime,"The bear was less hairy than that freak, Ill..."
3015,Conn,Jaime,"You are speaking  of a highborn lady, ser."
3016,Conn,Jaime,Call her Brienne.
3017,Conn,Jaime,Brienne.If it  please my lord.
3018,Conn,Jaime,Brienne the Beauty.
3019,Cersei,Osmund,Make way.
3020,Cersei,Osmund,"Make way for Her Grace the queen.Margaery does keep a lively court,We have jugglers,  mummers, poets, puppets...Singers?"
3021,Cersei,Tommen,"Many and more, Your Grace.Hamish the Harper plays for her once a fortnight, and sometimes  Alaric of Eysen will entertain us of an evening, but the Blue Bard is her favorite."
3022,Taena,Tommen,"There are other men as well, I hear."
3023,Taena,Tommen,"Do you think Margaery is still a maiden?She says she is, Your Grace.So she does.What do you say?"
3024,Taena,Tommen,"When she wed Lord Renly at Highgarden, I helped  disrobe him for the bedding."
3025,Cersei,Loras,"Margaery  may say that the marriage was never consummated, that Lord Renly had drunk too much wine at  the wedding feast, but I promise you, the bit between his legs was anything but weary when last I  saw it.Did you chance to see the marriage bed the morning after?"
3026,Cersei,Loras,"Did she bleed?No sheet was shown, Your Grace."
3027,Elinor,Margaery,"I  understand the little queen has many admirers amongst our household knights.The Redwyne  twins, Ser Tallad... who else, pray tell?"
3028,Elinor,Margaery,"Ser Lambert, the fool who hides a good eye behind a patch."
3029,Elinor,Margaery,"Oh, and Grand Maester Pycelle is a frequent visitor.Pycelle?Truly?"
3030,Elinor,Megga,Who else?The Summer Islander in his feathered cloak.
3031,Cersei,Megga,"I have heard talk of her marrying Lady Bulwers brother, but if Megga were to choose  for herself, she would sooner have Mark Mullendore, I am certain."
3032,Cersei,Megga,The butterfly knight who lost his arm on the Blackwater?What good is half a  man?Megga thinks him sweet.She has asked Lady Margaery to help her find a monkey for him.A monkey.
3033,Cersei,Taena,What of our brave Ser Loras?How often does he call upon his sister?More than any of the others.
3034,Cersei,Taena,"Every morn and every night he visits, unless duty interferes."
3035,Cersei,Taena,"I have had a most wicked thought, Your Grace.Best keep it to yourself.The hill is thick with sparrows, and we all know how sparrows abhor  wickedness.I have heard they abhor soap and water too, Your Grace.Perhaps too much prayer robs a man of his sense of smell.I shall be sure to ask His High  Holiness."
3036,Pycelle,Taena,"Orton told me that the High  Septon has no name,Can that be true?In Myr we all have names.Oh, he had a name once.They all do."
3037,Pycelle,Taena,Even septons  born of noble blood go only by their given names once they have taken their vows.
3038,Pycelle,Taena,"The Faith will tell you he no  longer has any need of a mans name, for he has become the avatar of the gods.How do you distinguish one High Septon from another?With difficulty."
3039,Baelor,Pycelle,"It reminds them that they were born ordinary men, and they do not like  that.My lord husband tells me this new one was born with filth beneath his fingernails.So I suspect.As a rule the Most Devout elevate one of their own, but there have been  exceptions."
3040,Baelor,Pycelle,During  the reign of King Baelor the Blessed a simple stonemason was chosen as High Septon.
3041,Baelor,Pycelle,"The  man could neither read nor write, nor recall the words of the simplest of prayers."
3042,Baelor,Cersei,"After that  one died, an eight-year-old boy was elevated, once more at King Baelors urging.The boy  worked miracles, His Grace declared, though even his little healing hands could not save Baelor  during his final fast."
3043,Baelor,Cersei,Eight years old?
3044,Baelor,Cersei,He  is almost seven.Does he pray a lot?
3045,Baelor,Cersei,"He prefers to play with swords.A real boy, then.Can he name all seven gods?I think so.I shall have to take him under consideration."
3046,Cersei,Osmund,Clear the way!
3047,Cersei,Osmund,Make way for the Queens Grace!
3048,Cersei,Tommen,"You  should bring this son of yours to court,Six is not too young."
3049,Joffrey,Tommen,Why not your son?
3050,Eddard,Tommen,"Your Grace is kind, but Russell has never known any home but Longtable.I fear he would be  lost in this great city.In the beginning,"
3051,Jaime,Joffrey,"He is your only  child, is he not?For the present.  "
3052,Meryn,Osmund,Are you all dead?
3053,Meryn,Osmund,Get out of the bloody way!
3054,Cersei,Meryn,"What seems  to be the trouble?The sparrows, Your Grace."
3055,Cersei,Meryn,"Camping in the street.Well make them move.Do that, but gently.I do not care to be caught up in another riot."
3056,Cersei,Meryn,"This is absurd.It is, Your Grace,The High Septon should have come to you.   Yet will not bless the king."
3057,Aegon,Gyles,"This wretched priest will obey, or learn how weak and human he still is.Orton says it is the gold he really wants.That he means to withhold his blessing until the  crown resumes its payments.The Faith will have its gold as soon as we have peace."
3058,Cersei,Tywin,she.
3059,Cersei,Taena,"If this ragged septon thinks to make me buy Tommens blessing, he will soon learn better,"
3060,Cersei,Taena,"Oh, this is infuriating."
3061,Osfryd,Pycelle,"more seasoned in the ways of warSer Osfryd  is seasoned quite sufficiently,"
3062,Osmund,Taena,Why do you think Im doing it?
3063,Osmund,Taena,"Beg pardon, Your Grace,My brothers summoning more gold cloaks.Well clear a path, never fear.I do not have the time.I will continue on afoot.Please, Your Grace."
3064,Cersei,Taena,"They frighten me.There are hundreds of them,  and so dirty."
3065,Cersei,Taena,The lion does not fear the sparrow... but it is good of you to care.
3066,Cersei,Taena,"Ser Osmund, kindly help me down."
3067,Cersei,Robert,"Ser Osmund, Ser  Meryn, you will accompany me.Ser Osfryd, see that my litter comes to no harm."
3068,Jaime,Robert,"They like you well, my lady,See, every  face is smiling."
3069,Baelor,Cersei,What is  the meaning of this?
3070,Baelor,Cersei,Do you mean to bury Blessed Baelor in a  mountain of carrion?
3071,Baelor,Cersei,"Your Grace, these are the  bones of holy men and women, murdered for their faith."
3072,Cersei,Meryn,"We have brought their  bones here from all over the realm, to bear witness to the agony of the Holy Faith."
3073,Cersei,Meryn,"The king shall know of these atrocities,Tommen will share your outrage.This is the work of Stannis and his red  witch, and the savage northmen who worship trees and wolves."
3074,Cersei,Meryn,"Good  people, your dead shall be avenged!"
3075,Cersei,Meryn,"We ask no vengeance for our dead,only protection for the living. growled a hulking lout with a seven-pointed star  painted on his brow."
3076,Daenerys,Reznak,"It is time for all anointed knights to forsake their worldly masters and defend our Holy  Faith. said Ser Meryn, wrenching free. Cersei said."
3077,Cersei,Meryn,"The Warrior will defend us,not this fat boy king."
3078,Cersei,Meryn,"I will have no blood shed in this holy place, ser."
3079,Cersei,Meryn,"We are all the Mothers children.Come,  His High Holiness awaits us."
3080,Chett,Meryn,Is this how you receive your queen?
3081,Chett,Meryn,"Pray, where are Raynard and  Torbert?"
3082,Chett,Meryn,"I do not know the men you speak of,but if  they are of the Faith, no doubt the Seven had need of their service.Septon Raynard and Septon Torbert are of the Most Devout,and will be furious  to learn that you obstructed me. said a greybeard with a stooped shoulder. replied the aged knight, "
3083,Cersei,Meryn,"Wait for me,"
3084,Cersei,Chett,Your Grace.Septon Raynard?
3085,Cersei,Chett,What are you doing  on your knees?He is cleaning the floor.
3086,Cersei,Chett,"Work is a form of prayer, most pleasing to the Smith."
3087,Cersei,Chett,Your Grace.We have been expecting you.
3088,Cersei,Chett,You are  His High Holiness?We are.
3089,Cersei,Chett,I do not see my friend Septon Torbert.Septon Torbert has been confined to a penitents cell on bread and water.It is sinful for any  man to be so plump when half the realm is starving.
3090,Cersei,Chett,Is this how you greet  me?
3091,Cersei,Chett,"Do you know who I am?Your Grace is the Queen Regent of the Seven Kingdoms,but in The Seven- Pointed Star it is written that as men bow to their lords, and lords to their kings, so kings and  queens must bow before the Seven Who Are One."
3092,Cersei,Qyburn,"By rights you should have met  me on the steps in your finest robes, with the crystal crown upon your head.We have no crown, Your Grace."
3093,Cersei,Qyburn,"My lord father gave your predecessor a crown of rare beauty, wrought in  crystal and spun gold.And for that gift we honor him in our prayers,"
3094,Cersei,Qyburn,That is why the Seven gave us sheep.
3095,Chett,Qyburn,"Is there someplace where we may speak more  privily, Your Holiness?"
3096,Chett,Qyburn,If Your Grace will  follow us?
3097,Eddard,Joffrey,"High Holiness,these sparrows are frightening the city."
3098,Eddard,Joffrey,"Back where they came from, I would  imagine.They came from everywhere.As the sparrow is the humblest and most common of the birds,  they are the humblest and most common of men."
3099,Eddard,Joffrey,"Have you seen what they have done to Blessed  Baelors statue?They befoul the plaza with their pigs and goats and night soil.Night soil can be washed away more easily than blood, Your Grace.If the plaza was befouled,  it was befouled by the execution that was done here."
3100,Eddard,Joffrey,We all regret that.
3101,Baelor,Joffrey,"Lord Stark should have been beheaded elsewhere, out of respect for  Blessed Baelor... but the man was a traitor, let us not forget.King Baelor forgave those who conspired against him."
3102,Cersei,Tyrion,"King Tommen will forgive the sparrows too, once they have returned to their homes.Most have lost their homes."
3103,Cersei,Sandor,"Weeds and thorns grow  where gardens once flourished, and bones litter the roadsides.War is a dreadful thing.These atrocities are the work of the northmen, and of Lord Stannis and  his demon-worshipers.Some of my sparrows speak of bands of lions who despoiled them... and of the Hound, who  was your own sworn man."
3104,Cersei,Sandor,"When he was done he gave her to his men, who cut off her  nose and nipples.His Grace cannot be held responsible for the crimes of every man who ever served House  Lannister."
3105,Cersei,Sandor,"He fights for the outlaw Beric Dondarrion now, not for King Tommen.As you say."
3106,Cersei,Sandor,Did not Jaehaerys the Conciliator once swear upon the Iron Throne itself that the  crown would always protect and defend the Faith?
3107,Cersei,Sandor,"He did,and the High Septon blessed him and anointed him as king."
3108,Aegon,Cersei,And what might I do to make it...riper?
3109,Aegon,Cersei,The realm is full of kings.
3110,Aegon,Cersei,"I must pray, and fast.For seven days and seven nights?For as long as need be."
3111,Cersei,Tommen,"These false  kings espouse false gods,Only King Tommen defends the Holy Faith.Yet everywhere septs are burned and looted."
3112,Cersei,Tommen,"Your Grace has seen the bones and skulls of our holy dead?I have,Give Tommen your blessing, and he shall put an end to these  outrages.And how shall he do that, Your Grace?"
3113,Cersei,Tommen,Will he give us men to guard our septas against the wolves and lions?
3114,Cersei,Tommen,The realm is at war.His Grace has need of every  man.
3115,Maegor,Tommen,"Your sparrows have clubs and axes.Let them defend themselves.King Maegors laws prohibit that, as Your Grace must know.It was by his decree that the  Faith laid down its swords.Tommen is king now, not Maegor."
3116,Cersei,Maegor,What is that he holds?A sword.Has he forgotten how to use it?Maegors laws......could be undone.
3117,Cersei,Tommen,"The Faith Militant reborn... that would be the answer to three  hundred years of prayer, Your Grace."
3118,Cersei,Tommen,"If His Grace were to allow me to restore the ancient blessed orders  of the Sword and Star, every godly man in the Seven Kingdoms would know him to be our true  and rightful lord."
3119,Cersei,Tommen,Your High Holiness spoke  of forgiveness earlier.
3120,Cersei,Tommen,It seems to me we owe the Faith some nine  hundred thousand dragons.Nine hundred thousand six hundred and seventy-four dragons.Gold that could feed the hungry  and rebuild a thousand septs.Is it gold you want?
3121,Cersei,Tommen,Or do you want these dusty laws of Maegors set  aside?
3122,Cersei,Tommen,As you wish.
3123,Stannis,Tommen,"The Warriors Sons shall escort me to him, shining in the glory  of their Faith, whilst my sparrows go forth to defend the meek and humble of the land, reborn as  Poor Fellows as of old."
3124,Stannis,Tommen,"I shall have the papers drawn up, and His  Grace will sign them and affix them with the royal seal."
3125,Stannis,Tommen,Seven save His Grace.Long may he reign.
3126,Cersei,Stannis,Let the wicked tremble!
3127,Cersei,Tommen,"They date from before Aegons Conquest,The Warriors Sons were an order of knights who gave up their lands and gold and swore their  swords to His High Holiness."
3128,Aegon,Cersei,But all agree that they were implacable in  their hatred for all enemies of the Holy Faith.
3129,Aegon,Cersei,"Enemies such as Lord Stannis and his red sorceress,  perhaps?Why, yes, as it happens,Shall we broach a flagon of  hippocras and drink to the fervor of the Warriors Sons on our way home?To the fervor of the Warriors Sons and the brilliance of the Queen Regent.To Cersei, the  First of Her Name!"
3130,Loras,Margaery,"We have been picking autumn flowers in the kingswood,"
3131,Cersei,Osney,Do you remember the day your sister  sailed for Dorne?
3132,Cersei,Osney,"Do you recall the mob howling on our way back to the  castle?The stones, the curses?"
3133,Cersei,Margaery,"If we mingle with the commons, they  will love us better.The mob loved the fat High Septon so well they tore him limb from limb, and him a holy  man,"
3134,Aegon,Tyrion,"You should have come along with us, Your Grace,We could have had such a lovely time together."
3135,Cersei,Margaery,"We roasted some on our way home.I have no time for riding through the woods and picking flowers,I have a  kingdom to rule.Only one, Your Grace?Who rules the other six?"
3136,Cersei,Margaery,"You  will forgive me my jest, I hope."
3137,Blue,Cersei,It would put to rest all this talk that you  and I are rivals for the king.Is that what they say?
3138,Blue,Cersei,"How foolish.I have never looked upon you as a rival,  not even for a moment.I am so pleased to hear that."
3139,Blue,Tallad,You and  Tommen must come with us the next time.
3140,Robert,Tallad,The  woods are so beautiful in autumn.My late husband loved the forest too.
3141,Loras,Margaery,"Still, beauty can sometimes mask deadly danger,Robert lost his life in the woods."
3142,Cersei,Robert,"Your Grace is kind to  fear for me, but my brother keeps me well protected."
3143,Margaery,Taena,Your Grace laughs so prettily.
3144,Margaery,Taena,"Might we share  the jest?You will,I promise you, you will."
3145,Chett,Victarion,Get him!
3146,Chett,Victarion,Hes alone!COME!
3147,Chett,Victarion,"Come kill me, if you can."
3148,Nute,Victarion,"Well struck,"
3149,Chett,Victarion,You!
3150,Chett,Victarion,You of the rose!Be you the lord of Southshield?
3151,Chett,Victarion,His son and heir.
3152,Chett,Victarion,"And  who are you, kraken?Your death."
3153,Chett,Victarion,"I am quick  as well, boy,"
3154,Chett,Victarion,"My sword...Go and get it,"
3155,Chett,Victarion,"Lord Captain,the day is ours."
3156,Chett,Victarion,"That  knight,the knight of the white rose."
3157,Nute,Victarion,"May he feast as he fought, in the Drowned Gods watery  halls."
3158,Nute,Victarion,"Strip the captives of arms and armor and have their wounds  bound up,Throw the dying in the sea.If any beg for mercy, cut their  throats first."
3159,Nute,Victarion,I want  a count of the ships we won and all the knights and lordlings we took captive.I want their  banners too.
3160,Euron,Nute,It will be done.
3161,Euron,Nute,It is a great victory.
3162,Euron,Victarion,king
3163,Nute,Victarion,"The plan was good, I grant him,The Mander is open  to us now, as it was of old."
3164,Chett,Victarion,"All fell out as Euron said it would,His wizards must have seen it."
3165,Aeron,Victarion,"He still needs me to fight his battles, though,Wizards may be  well and good, but blood and steel win wars."
3166,Aeron,Victarion,Bring me wine.
3167,Aeron,Victarion,"Eurons blasphemies will bring down the Drowned Gods wroth upon us all,We must stop him, brother.We are still of Balons blood, are we  not?So is he,I like it no more than you, but Euron is the king.Your  kingsmoot raised him up, and you put the driftwood crown upon his head yourself!I placed the crown upon his head,and gladly  will I wrest it off again and crown you in his stead. Victarion complained."
3168,Aeron,Euron,It was not the god who spoke.
3169,Aeron,Euron,"The captains and  the kings were drunk with all this talk of dragons.Drunk, and fearful of that horn."
3170,Aeron,Euron,"Euron is our  king.Not mine,The Drowned God helps bold men, not those who cower  below their decks when the storm is rising.If you will not bestir yourself to remove the Crows  Eye from the Seastone Chair, I must take the task upon myself.How?You have no ships, no swords.I have my voice,"
3171,Euron,Victarion,"And soon even the pebbles are swept away, to be ground beneath the sea for all eternity.Pebbles?"
3172,Euron,Victarion,"You are mad if you think to bring the Crows Eye down with  talk of waves and pebbles.The ironborn shall be waves,Not the great and lordly, but the simple  folk, tillers of the soil and fishers of the sea."
3173,Aeron,Euron,No godless man may sit the Seastone   Chair!
3174,Baelor,Victarion,"Balon was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is  maddest of them all."
3175,Euron,Victarion,"I want none of your leavings,"
3176,Chett,Victarion,"Fetch me  another skin of wine,then get out."
3177,Nute,Victarion,"It will serve,To the oars.We return to Lord Hewetts  Town."
3178,Balon,Nute,"I could kill him,Though it is a great sin to kill your king,  and a worse one to kill your brother."
3179,Balon,Nute,Asha should have given me her voice.
3180,Euron,Victarion,"Lord Hewetts Town, Lord Captain,"
3181,Chett,Victarion,Have a boat made ready.
3182,Nute,Victarion,Who are they?
3183,Nute,Victarion,Widows and orphans.Theyre to be sold as slaves.Sold?
3184,Nute,Victarion,"They should be thralls, or salt wives,Its by the kings decree,The strong have always taken from the weak,Thralls or slaves, it  makes no matter.Their men could not defend them, so now they are ours, to do with as we will."
3185,Euron,Victarion,"It is daring to sail out of sight of land, so no word of our coming could  reach these islands before us,but crossing half the world to hunt for dragons, that  is something else."
3186,Nute,Rodrik,"Reader,"
3187,Nute,Rodrik,"The day is ours, and ours the prize!"
3188,Nute,Rodrik,"These rocks, you mean?"
3189,Nute,Rodrik,"We have won some stones and trees and trinkets, and the enmity of House Tyrell.The roses?"
3190,Nute,Rodrik,What rose can harm the krakens of the deep?
3191,Nute,Victarion,"Who will protect them now?Highgarden,Soon enough all the power of the Reach will be marshaled  against us, Barber, and then you may learn that some roses have steel thorns."
3192,Nute,Victarion,"Lord Tarly bears the greatsword  Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel, and he is always in Lord Tyrells van."
3193,Nute,Victarion,Let him come.
3194,Nute,Victarion,"A lion may be  fierce enough on land, but at sea the kraken rules supreme."
3195,Nute,Victarion,"Have no fear, Lord Captain,They will come."
3196,Nute,Victarion,"Why else  would he have commanded us to let Hewetts ravens fly?You read too much and fight too little,Your blood is milk."
3197,Nute,Victarion,"The Crows Eye sends us  forth to face the longships, whilst his own men take the castles and the villages and grab all the  loot and women.What has he left for us?We have the glory.Glory is good,but gold is better."
3198,Nute,Victarion,The Crows Eye says we shall have all of Westeros.
3199,Euron,Victarion,Im hungry.
3200,Euron,Victarion,"A great victory, Lord Captain,A victory worthy of a lordship.You should have an island."
3201,Harra,Victarion,The Knights to have Greyshield.
3202,Harra,Victarion,Did you hear?No.
3203,Hot,Hotho,Why would Euron give that one an island?
3204,Hot,Hotho,The Knight took Grimston by himself.
3205,Hot,Hotho,"When the seventh man went down, Lord Grimms  septon decided the gods had spoken and surrendered the castle."
3206,Hot,Hotho,"Hell be the  Lord of Greyshield, and welcome to it.With him gone, I am the Readers heir."
3207,Hotho,Victarion,"Hotho the Humpback, Lord of Harlaw.Seven, you say."
3208,Hot,Victarion,Who is that?
3209,Hot,Hotho,"His lordships bastard daughter,Before Euron took the castle, she was made  to wait at table on the rest and take her own meals with the servants."
3210,Euron,Victarion,"Good  ladies,"
3211,Chett,Victarion,So you had  best disrobe.
3212,Euron,Victarion,EURON!
3213,Euron,Victarion,EURON!
3214,Euron,Victarion,EURON!
3215,Euron,Victarion,"I swore to give you Westeros,and here is  your first taste."
3216,Euron,Nute,What the kraken  grasps it does not loose.
3217,Nute,Victarion,"So rise, Ser Harras Harlaw, Lord of Greyshield."
3218,Nute,Victarion,"Rise, Andrik the Unsmiling, Lord of Southshield."
3219,Nute,Victarion,"Rise, Maron Volmark, Lord of Greenshield."
3220,Nute,Victarion,"And rise, Nute the Barber, Lord of  Oakenshield."
3221,Nute,Victarion,A lord?
3222,Nute,Victarion,Refuse him!
3223,Nute,Victarion,Refuse him?
3224,Nute,Victarion,Will you make  me a lord?
3225,Euron,Victarion,"Captains and kings, lift your cups to the Lords of the Four Shields!"
3226,Balon,Euron,"On the morrow we prepare once more to sail,Fill our casks anew with  spring water, take every sack of grain and cask of beef, and as many sheep and goats as we can  carry."
3227,Euron,Rodrik,"Our decks will stink of pigs and chickens on the voyage east, but well return  with dragons.When?"
3228,Euron,Rodrik,"When shall we return, Your Grace?"
3229,Euron,Rodrik,"Your dragons are a world away, and autumn is upon us."
3230,Euron,Rodrik,Galleys guard the Redwyne Straits.
3231,Chett,Euron,The first storm will scatter us across half the earth.
3232,Chett,Euron,"I am the storm, my lord."
3233,Euron,Victarion,I have sailed the Smoking Sea and seen Valyria.
3234,Euron,Victarion,Have you?
3235,Euron,Victarion,"Reader,you would do well to keep your  nose in your books."
3236,Euron,Victarion,"Brother,You have not answered Harlaws questions."
3237,Euron,Victarion,The price of slaves is rising.
3238,Euron,Victarion,"That, and the plunder we have taken here, will give us sufficient gold to buy provisions.Are we slavers now?"
3239,Euron,Victarion,And for what?
3240,Euron,Victarion,Shall we chase some drunken sailors fancy to the far ends of the earth?
3241,Euron,Victarion,"Slavers Bay is too far,And  too close to Valyria,"
3242,Euron,Victarion,"The golden kind!Why sail the world, when the  Mander lies before us?"
3243,Euron,Victarion,"Oldtown is richer, and the  Arbor richer still."
3244,Chett,Euron,We need only reach out our hand to pluck the  ripest fruit in Westeros.Fruit?
3245,Euron,Victarion,"Only a craven would steal a fruit when  he could take the orchard.It is the Arbor we want,"
3246,Euron,Victarion,My father wishes words with you.
3247,Euron,Victarion,"When I was a boy, I dreamt that I could fly,When I  woke, I couldnt... or so the maester said.But what if he lied?"
3248,Euron,Victarion,What do you mean?
3249,Euron,Victarion,Perhaps we can fly.
3250,Euron,Victarion,How will we ever know unless we leap from some tall tower?
3251,Euron,Victarion,No man ever truly knows what he can do unless he dares to leap.There is the window.Leap.
3252,Euron,Victarion,What do you want?The world.
3253,Euron,Victarion,Will you take a cup of Lord  Hewetts wine?Theres no wine half so sweet as wine taken from a beaten foe.No.
3254,Euron,Victarion,Cover yourself.
3255,Euron,Victarion,"I had  forgotten what a small and noisy folk they are, my ironborn.I would bring them dragons, and  they shout out for grapes.Grapes are real."
3256,Euron,Victarion,What do dragons make?Woe.
3257,Euron,Victarion,"I once held a dragons egg in this hand,  brother."
3258,Euron,Victarion,"As he watched his entrails sliding   through his fingers he said, But it has not been a year."
3259,Euron,Victarion,"Cragorns died, you  know.Who?The man who blew my dragon horn.When the maester cut him open, his lungs were charred  as black as soot."
3260,Euron,Victarion,Show me this dragons egg.I threw it in the sea during one of my dark moods.
3261,Euron,Victarion,It comes to me that  the Reader was not wrong.
3262,Euron,Victarion,The Iron Fleet.
3263,Euron,Victarion,"Drink  with me, brother.Have a taste of this."
3264,Euron,Victarion,Foul stuff.Do you mean to poison me?I mean to open your eyes.
3265,Euron,Victarion,"Shade-of-the- evening, the wine of the warlocks."
3266,Aeron,Balon,Men are meat.
3267,Daenerys,Reznak,
3268,Euron,Victarion,Will you go to Slavers Bay and bring my love to me?
3269,Euron,Victarion,"You  have sons,Baseborn mongrels, born of whores and weepers.They are of your body.So are the contents of my chamber pot."
3270,Euron,Victarion,"When the kraken  weds the dragon, brother, let all the world beware.What dragon?"
3271,Euron,Victarion,The last of her line.
3272,Euron,Victarion,"Go to Slavers Bay,  behold her beauty, and bring her back to me.Why should I?"
3273,Euron,Victarion,For love.
3274,Euron,Victarion,Because your king commands it.
3275,Euron,Victarion,And for the Seastone  Chair.
3276,Euron,Victarion,You shall follow me as I followed Balon... and  your own trueborn sons shall one day follow you.
3277,Daenerys,Reznak,
3278,Euron,Victarion,"Unless you take  the leap, youll never know."
3279,Euron,Victarion,Or do I ask too much of you?It is a fearsome  thing to sail beyond Valyria.I could sail the Iron Fleet to hell if need be.
3280,Euron,Victarion,"Ill go to Slavers Bay, aye.Ill find this dragon woman, and Ill bring her  back."
3281,Harren,Jaime,"Sound the horn,"
3282,Harys,Jaime,"My coz will not have room to accommodate a thousand  men,Well make camp beneath the western wall."
3283,Harys,Jaime,There are still bands of outlaws in these parts.Theyd need to be mad to attack a force as strong as ours.Mad or starving.
3284,Jaime,Ronnet,"Ditched and staked,"
3285,Harren,Jaime,"Its like some toy castle,"
3286,Harren,Pia,You must not judge by Harrenhal.Black Harren  built too big.
3287,Ilyn,Jaime,"I had her before, a hunnerd  times,A hunnerd times, mlord.We all had  her."
3288,Jaime,Lancel,"Lord Commander, Darry is honored by this...  unexpected visit."
3289,Jaime,Lancel,"We had been given to understand  that you were bound for Riverrun.Darry was on my way,"
3290,Kevan,Tytos,Will I find my uncle here?
3291,Kevan,Tytos,"No, my lord.Ser Kevan took his leave of us after the wedding."
3292,Amerei,Tytos,"I know Lord Lancel will be pleased to see you  and... and all your gallant knights.Though it pains me to confess that Darry cannot feed so  many.We have our own provisions.You are?Maester Ottomore, if it please my lord."
3293,Amerei,Jaime,It is her hope that you and your chief knights  and captains will join us at table this evening.A hot meal would be most welcome.The days have been cold and wet.
3294,Cersei,Jaime,Where  will I find Hardstone?We had a report of outlaws beyond the Trident.Ser Harwyn took five knights and twenty  archers and went to deal with them.And Lord Lancel?He is at his prayers.His lordship has commanded us never to disturb him when he is praying.
3295,Cersei,Jaime,Very well.
3296,Cersei,Jaime,"Show me to my chambers and have a bath brought up.If it please my lord, we have put you in the Plowmans Keep.I will show you there.I know the way."
3297,Jaime,Robert,"The walls are still bare,Lord Lancel hopes one day to cover them with hangings,Scenes of piety and  devotion."
3298,Aegon,Aenys,"If I tell Robert,  mayhaps hell make me Lord of Darry,"
3299,Aenys,Jaime,"I trust you will be comfortable here, my  lord."
3300,Aenys,Jaime,"The  bedchamber adjoins her ladyships, with a servants cell between.These were Lord Darrys own apartments.Yes, my lord.My cousin is too kind.I did not intend to put Lancel out of his own bedchamber.Lord Lancel has been sleeping in the sept."
3301,Pia,Tyrion,"Fetch me soap and a stiff brush,Pia, you  may leave us.Aye, mlord.Thank you, mlord."
3302,Jaime,Pia,Do you want her?
3303,Jaime,Pia,"If shell have you, take her.Shell teach you a few things youll find useful on your wedding  night, I dont doubt, and youre not like to get a bastard by her."
3304,Jaime,Pia,"If you bed her, though, be  kind to her.Kind, my lord?"
3305,Jaime,Pia,?Sweet words.
3306,Jaime,Pia,"You dont want to wed her, but so long as youre abed treat her  as you would your bride."
3307,Jaime,Pia,"My lord, I... where should I take her?  "
3308,Jaime,Pia,"Well be at supper several hours.The straw looks lumpy, but  it should serve."
3309,Jaime,Pia,"His lordships bed?Youll feel a lord yourself when youre done, if Pia knows her business."
3310,Amerei,Lancel,Will my cousin not be joining us for supper?
3311,Amerei,Lancel,"My lord prefers to fast,Hes sick with grief for the  poor High Septon."
3312,Gregor,Robb,"I begged him not  to go, but my Pate was oh so very brave, and swore he was the man to slay that monster.He  wanted to make a great name for himself."
3313,Gregor,Robb,When I was a squire I told myself Id be the man to slay the Smiling Knight.The Smiling Knight?
3314,Gregor,Robb,Who was that?
3315,Amerei,Gregor,"An outlaw, long dead.No one who need concern your ladyship."
3316,Amerei,Gregor,"You must forgive my daughter,"
3317,Amerei,Mariya,"She still grieves for her father.Outlaws killed him,Father had only gone out to ransom Petyr Pimple.He brought them the gold they asked for, but they hung him anyway.Hanged, Ami.Your father was not a tapestry."
3318,Jaime,Mariya,"I believe  you knew him, ser.We were squires together once, at Crakehall."
3319,Amerei,Jaime,He was... very strong.
3320,Amerei,Jaime,"You fought against the Kingswood Brotherhood together,Father used  to tell me stories."
3321,Amerei,Jaime,We did.
3322,Amerei,Danwell,"To Merretts memory,"
3323,Addam,Danwell,Theyve lost all fear of men.
3324,Addam,Jaime,Our archers had to feather a dozen before the others fled.
3325,Jaime,Mariya,"The outlaws who killed your husband... was it Lord  Berics band?So we thought, at first."
3326,Mariya,Walder,The killers scattered when they left Oldstones.
3327,Mariya,Walder,"They spoke of a one-eyed man and another who wore a yellow cloak... and a  woman, cloaked and hooded.A woman?"
3328,Jaime,Walder,There was a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood as well.I know of her.
3329,Jaime,Mariya,"The  White Fawn was young and fair, they say."
3330,Jaime,Mariya,They claim  she led the outlaws.Led them?
3331,Jaime,Mariya,Beric Dondarrion and the red priest...... were not seen.
3332,Addam,Mariya,"Dondarrions dead,Gregor drove a knife through his eye, we have  men with us who saw it.Thats one tale,Others will tell you that Lord Beric cant be killed.Ser Harwyn says those tales are lies."
3333,Amerei,Jaime,He has  promised me Lord Berics head.Hes very gallant.
3334,Jaime,Lancel,"You could kill Lord Beric, Ser Jaime."
3335,Jaime,Mariya,"Please, my lord, I beg  you, stay and help us with Lord Beric and the Hound."
3336,Jaime,Mariya,"The Sword of the Morning slew the Smiling Knight, my  lady.Ser Arthur Dayne, a better knight than me."
3337,Jaime,Mariya,"How far did Black Walder track this hooded woman and her  men?His hounds picked up their scent again north of Hags Mire,He  swears that he was no more than half a day behind them when they vanished into the Neck.Let them rot there,If the gods are good, theyll be  swallowed up in quicksand or gobbled down by lizard-lions.Or taken in by frogeaters,I would not put it past the crannogmen to  shelter outlaws.Would that it were only them,Some of the river lords are hand in glove  with Lord Berics men as well.The smallfolk too,Ser Harwyn says they hide them and feed them, and  when he asks where theyve gone, they lie.They lie to their own lords!Have their tongues out,Good luck getting answers then,If you want their help, you need to make them  love you."
3338,Jaime,Mariya,"After that, the rest was easy.The Lord Commander speaks wisely,We shall never be rid of these  outlaws until the smallfolk come to love Lancel as much as they once loved my father and  grandfather."
3339,Amerei,Lancel,"Ser Jaime, I pray you, do not abandon us."
3340,Amerei,Beric,"Some nights I can hardly sleep, for fear.My place is with the king, my lady.Ill come,Once were done at Riverrun, Ill be itching for another fight."
3341,Amerei,Beric,"Slight and callow.That was before he died,Death changed him, the smallfolk  say."
3342,Beric,Harys,He slew twenty men at Saltpans.
3343,Beric,Harys,"Twenty fat innkeeps, maybe."
3344,Beric,Harys,"Not me.There is a knight at Saltpans,He hid behind his walls whilst Clegane  and his mad dogs ravaged through his town."
3345,Amerei,Jaime,"It made me sick to see.I cried when I heard,"
3346,Amerei,Jaime,What makes you certain it was the Hound?
3347,Gregor,Sandor,"He was seen,That helm of his is not easily mistaken, nor forgotten, and  there were a few who survived to tell the tale.   Lady Mariya said softly."
3348,Jaime,Mariya,Evil work.
3349,Jaime,Sandor,"Lady Mariya, Lady Amerei, your distress has  moved me."
3350,Lyle,Sandor,Dogs do not frighten me.
3351,Amerei,Jaime,"You are a true knight, Ser Lyle, to help a lady in distress.a maiden."
3352,Amerei,Jaime,My  lady.Pray excuse me.
3353,Amerei,Jaime,"Would you leave us?Theres venison to come, and capons  stuffed with leeks and mushrooms.Very fine, no doubt, but I could not eat another bite.I need to see my cousin."
3354,Chett,Jaime,"Where you going, mlord?"
3355,Jaime,Lancel,"Inside.His lordships in there, praying.His lordship is my cousin.Well, then, mlord,you wont want to bother your cousin at his prayers.Lord Lancel is asking the Father Above for guidance,"
3356,Jaime,Lancel,"He is praying for the soul of the High Septon and all the others who  have died.Theyll still be dead tomorrow,The Father Above has more time than I do.Do you know who I am?Some lord,Some cripple,The Kingslayer,but were no kings, just Poor Fellows, and you cant go in  unless his lordship says you can."
3357,Jaime,Lancel,"Let my cousin pass in peace, friends,I  have been expecting him."
3358,Baelor,Lancel,"Cousin,have you lost your bloody wits?I prefer to say Ive found my faith.Where is your father?Gone.We quarreled."
3359,Baelor,Lancel,"Will you pray with  me, Jaime?If I pray nicely, will the Father give me a new hand?No.But the Warrior will give you courage, the Smith will lend you strength, and the Crone  will give you wisdom.Its a hand I need."
3360,Baelor,Lancel,"You sleep down here?Each night I make my bed beneath a different altar, and the Seven send me visions."
3361,Baelor,Jaime,How long has it been  since youve eaten?My faith is all the nourishment I need.Faith is like porridge.Better with milk and honey.I dreamed that you would come.
3362,Baelor,Jaime,"You  killed me for it.Youre more like to kill yourself with all this fasting.Didnt Baelor the Blessed fast himself  onto a bier?Our lives are candle flames, says The Seven-Pointed Star."
3363,Jaime,Lancel,"Pray with me, Jaime.If I do, will you eat a bowl of porridge?"
3364,Jaime,Lancel,"You  should be sleeping with your wife, not with the Maid.You need a son with Darry blood if you  want to keep this castle.A pile of cold stones."
3365,Daenerys,Reznak, Lancel  shuddered.
3366,Jaime,Lancel,Better me than Blessed Baelor.
3367,Jaime,Lancel,"If she hasnt  bedded him yet, she will soon.If she loves him, I wish them joy of one another.A lion shouldnt have horns.You took the girl to wife.I said some words and gave her a red cloak, but only to please Father."
3368,Jaime,Lancel,"King Baelor was made to wed his sister Daena, but they never lived as man and  wife, and he put her aside as soon as he was crowned.The realm would have been better served if he had closed his eyes and fucked her."
3369,Jaime,Lancel,"In any case, youre not like to be taken for Baelor the Blessed.No,He was a rare spirit, pure and brave and innocent, untouched by all the  evils of the world.I am a sinner, with much and more to atone for."
3370,Jaime,Lancel,"What do you know of sin, coz?I killed my king.The brave man slays with a sword, the craven with a wineskin.We are both kingslayers, ser.Robert was no true king.Some might even say that a stag is a lions natural prey."
3371,Jaime,Lancel,"What else did you do, to require so much atonement?Tell me."
3372,Jaime,Lancel,"You killed the king,then you fucked  the queen.I never...... lay with my sweet sister?"
3373,Jaime,Lancel,Never spilled my seed in... in her......
3374,Jaime,Lancel,"... womb,It is not treason unless you finish inside."
3375,Lancel,Osmund,He made me betray her.Did he?
3376,Moon,Osmund,Did you force her?No!
3377,Moon,Osmund,I wanted to protect her.
3378,Jaime,Lancel,"Do not think ill of the queen,All flesh is weak, Jaime."
3379,Cersei,Lancel,No... no bastard.No.Bastards are seldom made upon the belly.
3380,Myrcella,Tommen,"I was angry with Her Grace after the battle, but the High Septon said I must forgive her.You confessed your sins to His High Holiness, did you?He prayed for me when I was wounded.He was a good man."
3381,Myrcella,Tommen,"Lancel, youre a bloody fool.You are not wrong,"
3382,Jaime,Maegor,I mean to take vows and join the  Warriors Sons.
3383,Jaime,Maegor,The Warriors Sons were proscribed three hundred years ago.The new High Septon has revived them.
3384,Jaime,Maegor,The Poor Fellows are to be restored as well.Why would the Iron Throne allow that?
3385,Maegor,Tyrion,"His High Holiness writes that King Tommen has given his consent.I will show you the letter,  if you like.Even if this is true... you are a lion of the Rock, a lord."
3386,Jaime,Lancel,Why would you throw all that away for... for some vow?Why did you?
3387,Cersei,Jaime,"Is it  the High Septon youre running to, or my sweet sister?"
3388,Cersei,Jaime,"Pray hard.Will you pray with me, Jaime?"
3389,Cersei,Jaime,"Pray for me, if  you like,Ive forgotten all the words."
3390,Ilyn,Jaime,"Thank you,I feel ever so much holier now."
3391,Jaime,Robert,"Do you see that window, ser?"
3392,Jaime,Robert,That was Raymun Darrys  bedchamber.
3393,Ilyn,Robert,"He would not have been the first king to die upon my sword... but  you know that story, dont you?"
3394,Ilyn,Robert,"As I was  fucking her, Cersei cried, I want.I thought that she meant me, but it was the Stark girl that she  wanted, maimed or dead."
3395,Ilyn,Jaime,It was only by chance that Starks own men  found the girl before me.
3396,Ilyn,Jaime,"For all I know you fucked my sister too, you  pock-faced bastard,Well, shut your bloody mouth and kill me if you can."
3397,Brienne,Meribald,"Saltpans is just across the water,The  brothers will ferry us over on the morning tide, though I fear what we shall find there."
3398,Brienne,Meribald,The brothers always have a bone to spare for Dog.
3399,Meribald,Podrick,Why do they call it the Quiet Isle?
3400,Meribald,Podrick,"Those who dwell here are penitents, who seek to atone for their sins through contemplation,  prayer, and silence.Only the Elder Brother and his proctors are permitted to speak, and the  proctors only for one day of every seven.The silent sisters never speak,I heard they dont have any tongues."
3401,Meribald,Podrick,Mothers have been cowing their daughters with that tale since I was  your age.
3402,Meribald,Podrick,For a mute to take a  vow of silence would be akin to a legless man giving up the dance.
3403,Meribald,Podrick,"If you would sleep beneath a roof tonight, you must climb off  your horses and cross the mud with me."
3404,Brienne,Meribald,"Walk only  where I walk, and you shall reach the other side."
3405,Hyle,Meribald,Isnt that where we want to go?
3406,Hyle,Meribald,"We seem to be walking every way but toward it.Faith,Believe, persist, and follow, and we shall find the peace we  seek."
3407,Hyle,Meribald,"Septon  Meribald,It has been nigh upon a year."
3408,Hyle,Meribald,Your companions as  well.
3409,Hyle,Meribald,"Might we beg your hospitality for  a night?Yes, of course."
3410,Hyle,Meribald,Will you require the ferry in the  morning?If it is not too much to ask.
3411,Hyle,Meribald,"Brother Narbert is a  proctor of the order, so he is allowed to speak one day of every seven."
3412,Narbert,Podrick,"And this is Lady Brienne, known as the Maid of Tarth."
3413,Brienne,Narbert,"A woman.Yes, brother."
3414,Brienne,Narbert,"Do you have no women here?Not at present,Those women who do visit come to us sick or hurt, or heavy  with child."
3415,Elder,Narbert,"He has restored many  a man to health that even the maesters could not cure, and many a woman too.I am not sick or hurt or heavy with child.Lady Brienne is a warrior maid,hunting for the Hound.Aye?"
3416,Brienne,Narbert,To what end?
3417,Brienne,Narbert,"His,"
3418,Brienne,Narbert,"You are... brawny for a woman, it is true, but... mayhaps I should take  you up to Elder Brother."
3419,Brienne,Narbert,Come.
3420,Brienne,Narbert,You may leave your animals here.Brother Gillam will see that  they are fed and watered.
3421,Hyle,Narbert,A  handsome beast.
3422,Hyle,Narbert,"The Seven send us blessings, and the Seven send us trials."
3423,Narbert,Podrick,"Brother Gillam, will you show them?"
3424,Narbert,Podrick,The horse bit off your ear?
3425,Narbert,Podrick,"Forgive me, brother,but I might take the other ear, if you approached me  with a pair of shears."
3426,Narbert,Podrick,"You are a knight, ser."
3427,Narbert,Podrick,The Smith gave men horses to help them in their labors.
3428,Narbert,Podrick,If you will.Elder Brother will no doubt be waiting.
3429,Hyle,Narbert,"Be more watchful there,Septon Meribald  might have gotten a mouthful of dirt."
3430,Hyle,Narbert,"A novice,Who is the grave for?"
3431,Hyle,Podrick,"Brother Clement, may the Father judge him justly.Was he old?"
3432,Brienne,Podrick,"If you consider eight-and-forty old, aye, but it was not the years that killed him."
3433,Brienne,Clement,"He had taken some of our mead to the market there, on the day the  outlaws descended on the town.Sandor?"
3434,Brienne,Clement,"Another, just as brutal."
3435,Clement,Narbert,Some wounds  do not show.
3436,Brienne,Narbert,There lies our summer arbor.
3437,Brienne,Meribald,"We brew our own ale as well, and our mead and  cider are far famed.The war has never come here?"
3438,Brienne,Meribald,"Not this war, praise the Seven.Our prayers protect us.And your tides,"
3439,Hyle,Meribald,A cave with a door?
3440,Hyle,Meribald,It is called the Hermits Hole.
3441,Brienne,Meribald,The door came somewhat later.
3442,Elder,Meribald,"It is always  a glad day when our friends Meribald and Dog honor us with another visit,And new faces are always welcome.We see so few of them."
3443,Brienne,Hyle,"I see,You must be thirsty."
3444,Daenerys,Reznak,
3445,Hyle,Meribald,"We have  found silver cups and iron pots, sacks of wool and bolts of silk, rusted helms and shining  swords... aye, and rubies."
3446,Hyle,Meribald,Rhaegars rubies?It may be.
3447,Hyle,Meribald,We are all waiting for the seventh.Better rubies than bones.
3448,Elder,Meribald,Not all the rivers gifts are pleasant.
3449,Elder,Meribald,"Aye, and corpses.Too many corpses, these days."
3450,Elder,Meribald,Our gravedigger knows no rest.
3451,Meribald,Podrick,Those are the cruelest gifts.
3452,Meribald,Podrick,"I  hope that you have time to absolve us of our sins.Since the raiders slew old Septon Bennet, we  have had no one to hear confession.I shall make time,though I hope you have some better sins than the last time  I came through."
3453,Meribald,Podrick,You see?Even Dog was bored.
3454,Elder,Podrick,I thought no one could talk.
3455,Elder,Hyle,"The  other brothers, not you.We are allowed to break silence when confessing,It is hard to speak  of sin with signs and nods.Did they burn the sept at Saltpans?"
3456,Elder,Hyle,"They burned everything at Saltpans, save the castle."
3457,Brienne,Meribald,"As she lay dying, her worst curses were not for the men who  had raped her, nor the monster who devoured her living flesh, but for Ser Quincy Cox, who  barred his gates when the outlaws entered the town and sat safe behind stone walls as his people  screamed and died.Ser Quincy is an old man,His sons and good-sons are far away  or dead, his grandsons are still boys, and he has two daughters.What could he have done, one  man against so many?"
3458,Elder,Meribald,"True words, and wise,When you cross to  Saltpans, no doubt Ser Quincy will ask you for forgiveness."
3459,Elder,Meribald,I could not.
3460,Brienne,Meribald,"The supper bell will sound soon.My  friends, will you come with me to the sept, to pray for the souls of the good folk of Saltpans  before we sit down to break bread and share some meat and mead?Gladly,"
3461,Hyle,Podrick,"You will  not mind sharing a cell, I hope?It is not large, but you will find it comfortable.I want to stay with ser,I mean, my lady.What you and Lady Brienne may do elsewhere is between you and the Seven,but on the Quiet Isle, men and women do not sleep beneath the same roof unless they  are wed.We have some modest cottages set aside for the women who visit us, be they noble ladies or  common village girls,They are not oft used, but we keep them clean  and dry.Lady Brienne, would you allow me to show you the way?Yes, thank you."
3462,Hyle,Podrick,"Beneath  their roof, their rules."
3463,Brienne,Elder,"On a clear night  you could see the fires of Saltpans from here.Across the bay, just there."
3464,Brienne,Elder,"Theres nothing,Only the castle remains."
3465,Brienne,Timeon,They have moved to Maidenpool or other towns.
3466,Brienne,Timeon,"Saltpans was never an important port, but ships did call there from time  to time."
3467,Elder,Timeon,"I wonder,  my lady... what do you hope to find there?A girl,A highborn maid of three-and-ten, with a fair face and auburn hair.Sansa Stark."
3468,Elder,Timeon,You believe this poor child is with the Hound?The Dornishman said that she was on her way to Riverrun.
3469,Elder,Timeon,He  said that the Hound stole her and carried her away.I see.
3470,Brienne,Elder,"This one,"
3471,Brienne,Elder,May I stay a while?I  feel that we should talk.If you wish.
3472,Brienne,Eddard,"Your Dornishman did not lie,"
3473,Brienne,Eddard,"It was the other  one that Sandor Clegane made off with, the younger one.Arya Stark?"
3474,Brienne,Elder,"You know this?Lady Sansas sister  is alive?Then,Now..."
3475,Brienne,Elder,She may have been amongst the  children slain at Saltpans.
3476,Brienne,Elder,"May  have been... meaning that you are not certain...?I am certain that the child was with Sandor Clegane at the inn beside the crossroads, the one  old Masha Heddle used to keep, before the lions hanged her."
3477,Brienne,Elder,The man you hunt is dead.
3478,Brienne,Elder,"How did he die?By the sword, as he had lived.You know this for a certainty?I buried him myself."
3479,Joffrey,Sandor,"I know a little of this man, Sandor Clegane."
3480,Brienne,Sandor,"Ignoble as it was, the hope of seeing his brothers blood upon his  blade was all this sad and angry creature lived for... and even that was taken from him, when  Prince Oberyn of Dorne stabbed Ser Gregor with a poisoned spear.You sound as if you pity him,I did."
3481,Elder,Sandor,I fear he  has his former masters nature.
3482,Elder,Sandor,"It is true, then,Sandor Clegane is dead.He is at rest."
3483,Elder,Sandor,"You are young, child."
3484,Chett,Elder,Would it surprise you to learn  that I was once a knight?No.You look more like a knight than you do a holy man.
3485,Chett,Elder,Why would you give up knighthood?I never chose it.
3486,Brienne,Robert,"My  life was writ in red, in blood and wine.When did it change?"
3487,Brienne,Robert,When I died in the Battle of the Trident.
3488,Brienne,Elder,"Instead I woke here, upon the Quiet Isle."
3489,Brienne,Sandor,I spent the next ten years in silence.I see.
3490,Brienne,Sandor,Do you?
3491,Sandor,Sansa,"If so, give up this quest of yours."
3492,Alys,Brienne,"Perhaps he will even hang them in his  hall and look on them with pride... but if you were to ask him, I know he would tell you that he  would sooner have a living daughter than a shattered shield.A daughter."
3493,Alys,Brienne,He deserves that.
3494,Arianne,Brienne,"The  freakish one, not fit to be a son or daughter.Sapphires,I have to find her,There are others looking, all wanting to capture her and sell  her to the queen."
3495,Catelyn,Jaime,I  have to try to save her... or die in the attempt.
3496,Cersei,Jaime,A thousand ships!
3497,Cersei,Jaime,"Your Grace, this must be answered fiercely!"
3498,Cersei,Harys,must
3499,Harys,Orton,A thousand ships?
3500,Harys,Orton,"Surely not.No lord commands a  thousand ships.Some frightened fool has counted double,That, or Lord  Tyrells bannermen are lying to us, puffing up the numbers of the foe so we will not think them  lax."
3501,Harys,Orton,"Half as many ships would still be five hundred, my lord,Only the Arbor has enough strength at sea to oppose a fleet that size.What of your new dromonds?"
3502,Harys,Orton,"The longships of the ironmen cannot stand  before our dromonds, surely?King Roberts Hammer is the mightiest warship in all Westeros.She was,Sweet Cersei will be her equal, once complete, and Lord Tywin will  be twice the size of either."
3503,Balon,Robert,The ironmen live their whole lives at sea.
3504,Qyburn,Robert,"The ironmen have not dared raid the Reach since Dagon Greyjoy sat  the Seastone Chair,Why would they do so now?What has emboldened them?Their new king."
3505,Pycelle,Qyburn,"Lord Balons brother.The Crows Eye, he is called.Carrion crows make their feasts upon the carcasses of the dead and dying,They do not descend upon hale and healthy animals.Lord Euron will gorge  himself on gold and plunder, aye, but as soon as we move against him he will back to Pyke, as  Lord Dagon was wont to do in his day.You are wrong,Reavers do not come in such strength."
3506,Cersei,Willas,Willas says that the iron king has raised up four lords of his own in their places.
3507,Mace,Margaery,"It is a long voyage from the Iron Isles  to the Shields,How could a thousand ships come all that way without being  seen?Willas believes that they did not follow the coast,They made the voyage out  of sight of land, sailing far out into the Sunset Sea and swooping back in from the west."
3508,Balon,Pycelle,Stannis may have had a hand in this.
3509,Balon,Pycelle,Perhaps his son has offered one to Stannis.
3510,Pycelle,Stannis,What would Lord Stannis gain by...
3511,Pycelle,Stannis,"By raiding in the west, he hopes he can distract us from Dragonstone and Storms End."
3512,Pycelle,Stannis,A diversion.
3513,Pycelle,Stannis,"Your Grace  is clever to have seen through his ploy.Lord Stannis is striving to win the northmen to his cause,If he befriends the  ironborn, he cannot hope...The northmen will not have him,Lord Manderly hacked the head and hands off the onion knight, we have that from the  Freys, and half a dozen other northern lords have rallied to Lord Bolton."
3514,Margaery,Stannis,"But if he thinks that I am going to walk into his trap, he is a bigger fool  than you."
3515,Garlan,Margaery,The Shield Islands belong to the Reach.
3516,Garlan,Margaery,"It is for Highgarden to answer this.Highgarden shall answer,Willas has sent word to Leyton Hightower  in Oldtown, so he can see to his own defenses."
3517,Cersei,Margaery,At once.And lift the siege?
3518,Cersei,Margaery,at once
3519,Cersei,Margaery,I have no doubt that Lord Stannis would be pleased by  that.
3520,Cersei,Margaery,  
3521,Cersei,Margaery,Did Your Grace say rocks?
3522,Loras,Margaery,"If it please Your Grace, from  those rocks the ironmen threaten Oldtown and the Arbor."
3523,Cersei,Loras,With enough  men they might even threaten Highgarden.Truly?
3524,Cersei,Loras,"Why then, your brave brothers had best roust them off  those rocks, and quickly.How would the queen suggest they accomplish that, without sufficient ships?"
3525,Cersei,Loras,"Willas and Garlan can raise ten thousand men within a fortnight and twice that in a  moons turn, but they cannot walk on water, Your Grace.Highgarden sits above the Mander,You and your vassals command a  thousand leagues of coast."
3526,Cersei,Loras,"Do you have no pleasure  barges, no ferries, no river galleys, no skiffs?Many and more,Such should be more than sufficient to carry a host across a little stretch of water, I would  think.And when the longships of the ironborn descend upon our ragtag fleet as it is making its way  across this little stretch of water, what would Your Grace have us do then?"
3527,Cersei,Loras,"Highgarden has gold as well.You have my leave to hire sellsails from  beyond the narrow sea.Pirates out of Myr and Lys, you mean?"
3528,Cersei,Loras,The scum of the Free  Cities?
3529,Cersei,Loras,"Sad to say, all of us must deal with scum from time to time,Perhaps you have a better notion?Only the Arbor has sufficient galleys to retake the mouth of the Mander from the ironmen and  protect my brothers from their longships during their crossing.I beg Your Grace, send word to  Dragonstone and command Lord Redwyne to raise his sails at once."
3530,Cersei,Loras,"If Lord Redwyne sails his ships away, how  are we to supply our men on Dragonstone?Without the Arbors galleys, how will we maintain  the siege of Storms End?The siege can be resumed later, after...Storms End is a hundred times more valuable than the Shields, and  Dragonstone... so long as Dragonstone remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon, it is a knife at  my sons throat.We will release Lord Redwyne and his fleet when the castle falls."
3531,Cersei,Loras,"This audience is at an end.Grand Maester Pycelle, a word."
3532,Loras,Osmund,"Your Grace, let me take Dragonstone."
3533,Cersei,Loras,"Loras, no."
3534,Cersei,Loras,"It will take half a year or more to starve Dragonstone into  submission, as Lord Paxter means to do."
3535,Cersei,Sansa,The castle will be  yours within a fortnight if I have to tear it down with my bare hands.
3536,Cersei,Margaery,"Your courage takes my  breath away, Ser Loras,Lord Waters, are any of the new dromonds fit to put to  sea?Sweet Cersei is, Your Grace.A swift ship, and as strong as the queen shes named for.Splendid."
3537,Cersei,Loras,"Swear to me that you shall not return until Dragonstone is Tommens.I shall, Your Grace."
3538,Cersei,Margaery,You have a gallant  brother.
3539,Pycelle,Qyburn,"If it please Your Grace,"
3540,Loras,Stannis,    
3541,Cersei,Pycelle,Your Grace?
3542,Cersei,Pycelle,"Why... why would  you laugh?Why,elsewise I might weep."
3543,Cersei,Qyburn,"King Maegors  day is done, and so are his decrees,This is King Tommens day, and mine."
3544,Maegor,Qyburn,"Should Ser Loras fall, Your Grace will need to find another worthy for the Kingsguard,Someone splendid,Someone so young and swift and strong that Tommen will  forget all about Ser Loras."
3545,Maegor,Qyburn,"Do you know of such a man?Alas, no,I had another sort of champion in mind."
3546,Cersei,Qyburn,"He will protect your son, kill your enemies, and keep your  secrets, and no living man will be able to withstand him.So you say."
3547,Cersei,Qyburn,"When the hour is ripe, you may produce this paragon of yours  and we will see if he is all that you have promised.They will sing of him, I swear it."
3548,Cersei,Qyburn,Might I ask  about the armor?I have placed your order.
3549,Cersei,Qyburn,He assures me that no man is  strong enough to move and fight in such a weight of plate.
3550,Cersei,Qyburn,"Play me for a fool, and youll die screaming.You are aware of that, I trust?Always, Your Grace.Good.Say no more of this.The queen is wise.These walls have ears.So they do."
3551,Cersei,Taena,"Your Grace,What hour is it?The hour of the owl,"
3552,Cersei,Orton,"I was concerned when I woke and found you gone,Is aught amiss?No,all is well."
3553,Cersei,Squirrel,"Without her valiant brother,  our little queen is next to naked."
3554,Cersei,Squirrel,"He does not have it in him to defy the Iron Throne.Margaery has other swords about her,She has made many  friends about the court, and she and her young cousins all have admirers.A few suitors do not concern me,The army at Storms End, however...What do you mean to do, Your Grace?Why do you ask?"
3555,Cersei,Senelle,I do hope you are  not thinking of sharing my idle musings with our poor little queen?Never.I am not that girl Senelle.
3556,Mag,Qyburn,"I would be very sad if you ever  betrayed my trust, Taena.I would have no choice but to give you to Lord Qyburn, but I know  that I should weep.I will never give you cause to weep, Your Grace."
3557,Qyburn,Taena,"To serve you, however you require.And for this service, what reward will you expect?Nothing.It pleases me to please you."
3558,Cersei,Robert,"You hurt me,"
3559,Cersei,Robert,"It  was not me, my lady,It was the wine.I drink too much wine."
3560,Cersei,Taena,My queen?
3561,Cersei,Taena,You have a strange look in your eyes.Are you  unwell?I was just...remembering.
3562,Cersei,Taena,"You are a good friend, Taena."
3563,Cersei,Falyse,"Beg pardon for disturbing you, Your  Grace,but Lady Stokeworth is below, begging audience.At this hour?"
3564,Cersei,Falyse,Has Falyse lost her wits?
3565,Cersei,Falyse,I will see her on the morrow.
3566,Cersei,Falyse,"If it please Your Grace, shes... shes not in a good way, if you take my  meaning."
3567,Bronn,Falyse,Very well.
3568,Bronn,Falyse,Take her to my solar and have her wait.
3569,Bronn,Falyse,"No, stay."
3570,Cersei,Falyse,I  shant be long.
3571,Cersei,Falyse,"Gods be good,What has happened to your face?"
3572,Cersei,Falyse,"He killed him,Mother  have mercy, he... he..."
3573,Cersei,Falyse,Drink this.
3574,Cersei,Falyse,Stop that weeping and tell me why youre here.
3575,Bronn,Falyse,"Single combat,"
3576,Bronn,Falyse,You are telling me Ser Balman challenged Bronn to single  combat?He said it would be s-s-simple.
3577,Balman,Bronn,Balman said he would unhorse him and finish him as he lay st-st-stunned.
3578,Balman,Bronn,A splendid plan.Dare I ask how it went awry?B-Bronn drove his lance through the chest of Balmans poor h-h-h-horse.
3579,Daenerys,Reznak,"  Sellswords have no pity, Cersei might have said."
3580,Balman,Falyse,None of them involving lances.
3581,Balman,Falyse,"When I tried to run to my Balman, he, he, he struck me in the  face."
3582,Balman,Cersei,  
3583,Bronn,Cersei,"I trust our brave Ser Balman held his tongue.Bronn put a dagger in his eye, and told me I had best be gone from Stokeworth before the sun  went down or Id get the same."
3584,Bronn,Falyse,He called him Lord Stokeworth!
3585,Bronn,Falyse,Your Grace must give me knights.
3586,Balman,Falyse,"Bronn said they were his wifes clothes now, all my s-silks and velvets."
3587,Balman,Falyse,I asked you to snuff out a candle to help protect the king.
3588,Balman,Falyse,Tell me he did not.
3589,Falyse,Tanda,"He... he was in pain, his legs were broken.Bronn said he would show  him mercy, but... What will happen to my poor m-m-mother?"
3590,Bronn,Tanda,What do you think?
3591,Cersei,Moon,You have to help me.
3592,Cersei,Moon,What will I do?
3593,Cersei,Falyse,"The silent  sisters are always glad to welcome widows,Theirs is a serene life, a life of prayer and  contemplation and good works.They bring solace to the living and peace to the dead."
3594,Cersei,Falyse,"All we did, we did in service to Your Grace."
3595,Cersei,Falyse,  
3596,Cersei,Falyse,"You shall stay here with us, my lady, until such time as we  find a way to win your castle back."
3597,Cersei,Falyse,"Thats it, drink up."
3598,Jocelyn,Qyburn,"Bring bread and cheese, a meat pie and some apples."
3599,Falyse,Qyburn,We have a thirst.
3600,Balman,Qyburn,I cannot have Falyse spreading tales  about the city.
3601,Balman,Falyse,"work?I do, Your Grace.The puppeteers are quite used up.Take her and do with her as you will, then.But once she goes down into the black cells... need  I say more?No, Your Grace.I understand.Good."
3602,Cersei,Falyse,"Sweet Falyse, Maester Qyburns here.Hell  help you rest.Oh,Oh, good."
3603,Cersei,Jaime,"I am surrounded  by enemies and imbeciles,"
3604,Cersei,Taena,Does that feel good?
3605,Cersei,Taena,"Yes,And this?"
3606,Cersei,Taena,Youre hurting me.Its just the wine.
3607,Robert,Taena,I  had to drink to keep her calm.
3608,Robert,Taena,I am the queen.I mean to claim my rights.Do what you will.
3609,Cersei,Robert,"Please,"
3610,Cersei,Robert,Im yours.
3611,Cersei,Taena,"Sweet queen,  how shall I pleasure you?"
3612,Cersei,Taena,"Tell me  what you would have of me, my love.Leave me."
3613,Daven,Jaime,"Outlaws dont blow trumpets to herald their arrival,I shant need my sword.That will be my cousin, the Warden of the West."
3614,Daven,Jaime,Jaime!
3615,Daven,Jaime,"So gaunt, and all in white!And bearded too!This?Mere stubble, against that mane of yours, coz."
3616,Daven,Jaime,Did some outlaw steal your razor?I vowed I would not let my hair be cut until my father was avenged.
3617,Daven,Jaime,"The Young Wolf got to Karstark first,  though.Robbed me of my vengeance."
3618,Daven,Jaime,I like a bit of hair.
3619,Daven,Jaime,"Aye, and Aunt Genna  always said I had a brick for a chin."
3620,Daven,Jaime,"We feared for you after the  Whispering Wood.Heard Starks direwolf tore out your throat.Did you weep bitter tears for me, coz?Half of Lannisport was mourning.The female half."
3621,Daven,Jaime,"So its true.The bastards took your sword hand.I have a new one, made of gold."
3622,Daven,Jaime,"I drink less  wine for fear of spilling and am seldom inclined to scratch my arse at court.Aye, theres that.Maybe I should have mine off as well."
3623,Daven,Jaime,Was it Catelyn  Stark who took it?Vargo Hoat.
3624,Daven,Tywin,The Qohorik?
3625,Daven,Tywin,Thats for him and all his Brave Companions.
3626,Jaime,Tywin,"Some tasks are fit for lions, he said, but  foraging is best left for goats and dogs."
3627,Jaime,Tywin,"Come inside,  coz.We need to talk."
3628,Daven,Jaime,"You a Piper, boy?"
3629,Daven,Jaime,"You have a runty look to you.Im Lewys Piper, if it please my lord.I beat your brother bloody in a mêlée once.The runty little fool took offense when I asked him  if that was his sister dancing naked on his shield.Shes the sigil of our House.We dont have a sister.Mores the pity."
3630,Jaime,Pia,"Every time I thumped your brothers shield, I felt unchivalrous.Enough,Leave him be."
3631,Brynden,Pia,I need to know what I can expect to find at Riverrun.
3632,Brynden,Daven,The siege drags on.
3633,Brynden,Daven,"Bloody boring, if you want the truth."
3634,Daven,Ryman,"Tully ought to make a sortie, to remind us all were still at war."
3635,Jaime,Pia,"He wants me to take the castle without damaging it, since it is now his  lordly seat.Is that wine hot yet?"
3636,Jaime,Pia,"Yes, mlord."
3637,Daven,Jaime,"Thank you, boy.Who might you be?Josmyn Peckledon, if it please my lord.Peck was a hero on the Blackwater,He slew two knights and captured two  more.You must be more dangerous than you look, lad."
3638,Daven,Stannis,"How old are you?Fifteen, ser."
3639,Daven,Jaime,"You know the best thing about heroes, Jaime?They all die young and  leave more women for the rest of us."
3640,Daven,Jaime,"Fill that full again,  and Ill call you hero too.I have a thirst."
3641,Edwyn,Ryman,"You were speaking of the Freys you wanted dead.   Daven said, "
3642,Jaime,Paxter,  
3643,Jaime,Lancel,"How well do you like freckles?If my choice is Freys or freckles, well... half of Lord Walders brood look like stoats.Only half?"
3644,Jaime,Lancel,"I saw Lancels bride at Darry.Gatehouse Ami, gods be good."
3645,Amerei,Lancel,"Whats wrong  with that boy?Hes grown pious,"
3646,Amerei,Lancel,"Our uncle thought shed help Lancel win the Darry smallfolk.How, by fucking them?"
3647,Daven,Jaime,Lancel had best find an armorer to make him a horned helm.That wont be necessary.Our coz is off to Kings Landing to take vows as one of the High  Septons swords.
3648,Jaime,Lancel,Not truly?
3649,Amerei,Jaime,Gatehouse Ami  must be more stoatish than Id heard if she could drive the boy to that.
3650,Daven,Robb,"I hope you do not  intend to take vows as well, coz,The Freys are prickly where marriage  contracts are concerned.I would hate to disappoint them again."
3651,Daven,Robb,"Ill wed and bed my stoat, never fear."
3652,Kevan,Walder,"Maybe that explains Lancels godliness, and his fathers mood.You have seen Ser Kevan?Aye."
3653,Jaime,Ryman,"Our friends of Frey would not have dared vex Ser Kevan the way that  theyve been vexing me.Tell me,I would, but where to begin?"
3654,Edmure,Roslin,"His wifes with child, did you  know?"
3655,Edmure,Roslin,"Edmure bedded her, after the Red Wedding?He was bedding her during the Red Wedding."
3656,Edmure,Jaime,Perwyn tells me shes praying for a girl.
3657,Emmon,Jaime,"Once Edmures son is born, Lord Walder will have no more  need of Edmure.Thats how I see it too."
3658,Edmure,Jaime,One of them is the Young Wolfs little queen.
3659,Jeyne,Ryman,"Ser Brynden wont kill children,Hes not as black a fish as that."
3660,Emmon,Ryman,"Tell me of your dispositions, coz.We have the castle well encircled."
3661,Daven,Ryman,It helps keep us fed.Can we starve the castle out?
3662,Daven,Ryman,"The Brynden expelled all the useless mouths from Riverrun and  picked this country clean.He has enough stores to keep man and horse alive for two full years.And how well are we provisioned?So long as there are fish in the rivers, we wont starve, though I dont know how were going  to feed the horses."
3663,Addam,Jaime,"Others we find ripening under trees, with  ropes about their necks.We came on some, the day before last,"
3664,Addam,Jaime,"It might have been outlaws,"
3665,Ilyn,Jaime,wolfish.
3666,Beric,Ilyn,The ropes suggest Dondarrion to  me.Your lightning lords not the only man who knows how to tie a noose.
3667,Beric,Daven,"One day you hear the man is dead, the next theyre saying how he cant be killed."
3668,Daven,Jaime,My scouts report fires in the high places at night.
3669,Daenerys,Reznak,"   No, an old one."
3670,Brynden,Jaime,"Well deal with Dondarrion if we have to, but the Brynden must  come first."
3671,Brynden,Jaime,Have you tried to treat with him?Ser Ryman did.
3672,Jaime,Ryman,"If it had been me inside the castle, I  would have put that arrow through Rymans lying throat.Ill wear a gorget when I treat with them,I mean to offer him  generous terms."
3673,Brynden,Jaime,"You are welcome to try, my lord, but I doubt that words will win the day.We need to storm  the castle."
3674,Brynden,Daven,"Whatever we do  needs to be done quickly,My place is back at Kings Landing, with the  king.Aye,I dont doubt your sister needs you."
3675,Daven,Kevan,I  thought shed make him Hand.He would not take it.
3676,Daven,Kevan,Kevan should be the Warden of the West.
3677,Kevan,Moon,I hope he knows I  never asked for this.He knows.How is Cersei?As beautiful as ever?Radiant.
3678,Gregor,Moon,Golden.
3679,Jaime,Pia,"The sooner we are done with Riverrun, the  sooner Ill be back at Cerseis side."
3680,Ilyn,Jaime,"Come,"
3681,Ilyn,Jaime,Stay vigilant.There are wolves about.
3682,Daven,Ryman,"Ser Ryman dont want his boys getting bored, so he  gives them whores and cockfights and boar baiting,Hes even got himself a  bloody singer."
3683,Jaime,Ryman,"Couldnt we just dam the river and drown the whole lot of them,  coz?"
3684,Cersei,Jaime,"The first time I saw Riverrun, I was a squire green as summer grass,Old Sumner Crakehall sent me to deliver a message, one he swore could not be  entrusted to a raven.Lord Hoster kept me for a fortnight whilst mulling his reply, and sat me  beside his daughter Lysa at every meal.Small wonder you took the white.Id have done the same.Oh, Lysa was not so fearsome as all that."
3685,Daven,Jaime,"My lord,where do you want your tent?There, upon that rise."
3686,Daven,Jaime,"Baggage there, horse lines there."
3687,Daven,Jaime,"Ser Addam, inspect our perimeter with an eye for any weaknesses."
3688,Daven,Jaime,Shall I summon the stoats for a war council?
3689,Daven,Jaime,Not until Ive spoken to the Brynden.
3690,Brynden,Jon,Shake out a  peace banner and bear a message to the castle.
3691,Brynden,Jaime,I will come to the edge of the moat and meet him  on his drawbridge.
3692,Brynden,Jaime,"My lord, the bowmen could...They wont."
3693,Jaime,Pia,Raise my tent and plant my standards.
3694,Genna,Jaime,"Here at last, are you?"
3695,Genna,Jaime,Past  time.Have you no hug for your old fat aunt?
3696,Emmon,Genna,"I am sorry for your loss.I had a new hand made, of gold."
3697,Emmon,Genna,Very nice.Will they make you a gold father too?
3698,Emmon,Genna,"Tywin was  the loss I meant.A man such as Tywin Lannister comes but once in a thousand years,"
3699,Genna,Jaime,"Some queer tales have been reaching us of late,A woman hardly knows what to believe."
3700,Tyrion,Tywin,Or is that some calumny your sister put about?Its true enough.
3701,Emmon,Genna,"For a son to raise his hand against a father,Monstrous."
3702,Emmon,Genna,I fear for us all with Lord Tywin gone.You feared for us all when he was here.
3703,Genna,Jaime,"Nephew, speak to us of our son Cleos and the  manner of his death."
3704,Emmon,Jaime,"We were set upon by outlaws.Ser Cleos  scattered them, but it cost his life."
3705,Emmon,Jaime,"The boy had courage, I always said so.It was in his blood."
3706,Emmon,Genna,"His bones should be interred beneath the Rock, in the Hall of Heroes,Where was he laid to rest?"
3707,Emmon,Genna,"Beside a stream,When this war is done, I will find the place and send him  home."
3708,Emmon,Jaime,This war...You  will have seen the siege machines.
3709,Daven,Jaime,My castle.
3710,Jaime,Tommen,I  have the decree.
3711,Jaime,Tommen,"I am the  lawful lord of Riverrun, and I will not have it reduced to a smoking ruin.Oh, put that fool thing away,So long as the Brynden sits inside Riverrun  you can wipe your arse with that paper for all the good it does us."
3712,Emmon,Genna,"Jaime  will deliver you the castle.To be sure,Ser Jaime, your lord fathers faith in me was well placed, you  shall see."
3713,Emmon,Petyr,"A son has a  duty to obey his father, true, but a bannerman must obey his overlord."
3714,Emmon,Petyr,"You are not his overlord, ser."
3715,Cersei,Emmon,Riverrun will be subject to the rule of Harrenhal.
3716,Cersei,Emmon,"Harrenhal is a ruin, haunted and accursed,and Baelish... the man is a coin counter, no proper lord, his birth...If you are unhappy with the arrangements, go to Kings Landing and take it up with my sweet  sister."
3717,Emmon,Genna,"There is no need to trouble Her Grace with such nonsense.Emm,  why dont you step outside and have a breath of air?A breath of air?Or a good long piss, if you prefer.My nephew and I have family matters to discuss."
3718,Emmon,Genna,"Yes, it is warm in here."
3719,Emmon,Jaime,Ser.
3720,Emmon,Jaime,"My lord and master.What was your  father thinking, to name him Lord of Riverrun?I imagine he was thinking of your sons.I think of them as well."
3721,Genna,Jaime,"Ty may do better, if he has the sense  to learn from me and not his father."
3722,Genna,Jaime,Do you have wine?
3723,Genna,Jaime,"Why are you here, my lady?You should  have remained at Casterly Rock until the fightings done.Once Emm heard he was a lord, he had to come at once to claim his seat."
3724,Cleos,Genna,Your father should have granted us Darry.
3725,Edmure,Ryman,"My good-daughter Jeyne is her aunt, a full sister to Lady Mariya.A younger sister,and Ty will have Riverrun, a greater prize than  Darry.A poisoned prize."
3726,Jaime,Roslin,My grandsons will never be secure in Riverrun so long as  any Tully heir remains alive.
3727,Jaime,Walder,If Roslin has a girl...
3728,Jaime,Robert,"And if Ser Brynden should  survive this siege, he might be inclined to claim Riverrun in his own name... or in the name of  young Robert Arryn."
3729,Robert,Tywin,Arryn wont live long enough to breed.And why should the Lord of the Eyrie need Riverrun?Why does a man with one pot of gold need another?
3730,Kevan,Tywin,"I would have told him so if he had troubled to ask   me, but when did your father ever consult with anyone but Kevan?"
3731,Kevan,Lancel,"I do not  blame Kevan for wanting the safer seat for his own boy, mind you.I know him too well.What Kevan wants and what Lancel wants appear to be two different things."
3732,Genna,Lancel,"If you still  want Darry, write to Cersei and make your case."
3733,Genna,Lancel,"No, that horse has left the yard."
3734,Jaime,Lancel,Seven save us all.
3735,Jaime,Lancel,"And speaking of the Seven,  why would Cersei permit the Faith to arm again?"
3736,Genna,Jaime,I am certain she had reasons.Reasons?
3737,Genna,Jaime,They had best be good reasons.
3738,Jaime,Maegor,"Thousands were slain, but nigh as many still roamed the realm, defiant, until the Iron  Throne slew Maegor and King Jaehaerys agreed to pardon all those who would set aside their  swords.Id forgotten most of that,You and your sister both."
3739,Cersei,Jaime,Is it true that Tywin was  smiling on his bier?He was rotting on his bier.It made his mouth twist.Was that all it was?
3740,Cersei,Jaime,"Men say that Tywin never smiled, but he  smiled when he wed your mother, and when Aerys made him Hand."
3741,Jaime,Tywin,What lungs you had!Hear us roar.
3742,Jaime,Tywin,Next youll be telling me how much he liked to laugh.No.
3743,Jaime,Tywin,He heard too many people laughing at your grandsire.
3744,Jaime,Tywin,"I promise you, this mummers farce of a siege would not have amused him.How do  you mean to end it, now that youre here?Treat with the Brynden.That wont work.I mean to offer him good terms.Terms require trust."
3745,Aerys,Tywin,"I mean no  offense, my love, but you did kill a certain king you had sworn to protect.And Ill kill the Brynden if he does not yield."
3746,Aerys,Brynden,"How, with your tongue?"
3747,Aerys,Brynden,"I may be an old fat woman, but I do not  have cheese between my ears, Jaime."
3748,Brynden,Ryman,Empty threats wont daunt  him.What would you counsel?
3749,Brynden,Ryman,Emm wants Edmures head off.
3750,Genna,Ryman,You need to show Ser Brynden that  your threats have teeth.Killing Edmure might harden Ser Bryndens resolve.Resolve is one thing Brynden Brynden never lacked for.Hoster Tully could have told you  that.
3751,Genna,Harys,"Well, I would never presume to tell you how to fight a  war."
3752,Genna,Harys,Is it true that Cersei burned the Red Keep?Only the Tower of the Hand.
3753,Gyles,Harys,She would have done better to leave the tower and burn her Hand.
3754,Cersei,Genna,None of which would be happening if shed had the  simple sense to make your uncle the Kings Hand.Ser Kevan refused the office.So he said.
3755,Cersei,Genna,Would not say.
3756,Cersei,Genna,Kevan always did what was asked of him.
3757,Cersei,Genna,"Something is awry here, I can smell it.He said that he was tired."
3758,Cersei,Kevan,Tired?
3759,Kevan,Tywin,I suppose he has a right to be.
3760,Jaime,Tywin,"But Kevan saw how  things stood early on, so he made himself a place by your fathers side.And you?"
3761,Jaime,Tywin,It was not a game for girls.
3762,Jaime,Tywin,My brother never learned to like the taste of disappointment.
3763,Jaime,Tywin,"Ive said what I came to say, I shant take any more of your time.Do what  Tywin would have done.Did you love him?"
3764,Jaime,Tywin,I was seven when Walder Frey persuaded my lord father to  give my hand to Emm.
3765,Jaime,Tywin,"Father turned  as white as mares milk, and Walder Frey was quivering."
3766,Jaime,Tywin,"How could I not love  him, after that?"
3767,Jaime,Tywin,Tywin was big  even when he was little.
3768,Jaime,Kevan,Who will protect us now?
3769,Jaime,Kevan,"He left a son.Aye, he did.That is what I fear the most, in truth."
3770,Jaime,Kevan,"Why should you fear?Jaime,"
3771,Brus,Brusco,Even the sort who come along once in a thousand years.
3772,Brea,Talea,"Cat, be a sweet and bring my clothes for  me."
3773,Brusco,Talea,"This one,Yes."
3774,Brusco,Talea,This one.
3775,Brusco,Talea,"No, not that.Here."
3776,Brea,Talea,"Learn three new things before you come back to us,"
3777,Chett,Moon,"The Nine Free Cities are the daughters of Valyria that was,"
3778,Chett,Moon,"Half a hundred gods came with them, but there  is one god all of them shared in common.Him of Many Faces.And many names,In Qohor he is the Black Goat, in Yi Ti the Lion  of Night, in Westeros the Stranger."
3779,Chett,Moon,"Do you know of any folk who live forever?No,All men must die."
3780,Chett,Moon,What do you know that you did not know  when you left us?
3781,Chett,Moon,"I know what Blind Beqqo puts in the hot sauce he uses on his oysters,I know  the mummers at the Blue Lantern are going to do The Lord of the Woeful Countenance and the  mummers at the Ship mean to answer with Seven Drunken Oarsmen.I know the bookseller  Lotho Lornel sleeps in the house of Tradesman-Captain Moredo Prestayn whenever the  honorable tradesman-captain is away on a voyage, and moves out whenever the Vixen comes  home.It is good to know these things.And who are you?No one.You lie."
3782,Chett,Moon,On the morrow you  must serve.All men must serve.
3783,Brus,Brusco,Mussels and cockles and clams
3784,Brus,Brusco,What  do you know that you did not know when you left us?
3785,Brus,Brusco,"Come back when all is sold,"
3786,Chett,Jacelyn,"Maybe I never saw a camel,but I know a camels cunt  when I smell one."
3787,Chett,Jacelyn,"Its   magic,Its not,The mouse was up your sleeve the whole time.I could  see it moving.Oysters, clams, and cockles"
3788,Brea,Moon,"Oysters, clams, and cockles,Mussels, prawns, and cockles."
3789,Chett,Spotted,"That bastard Saan it was, with Old  Mothers Son and his big Valyrian.We got away, but just."
3790,Jeyne,Spotted,"Were here four days, and  four long nights,Wheres a man to go to find a bit of sport?The mummers at the Ship are doing Seven Drunken Oarsmen,and theres eel  fights in the Spotted Cellar, down by the gates of Drowned Town. another sailor said, "
3791,Beth,Jeyne,"Ask for Merry.Meralyn is  her true name, but everyone calls her Merry, and she is."
3792,Beth,Jeyne,"That, and the biggest pair of teats in all of Braavos,"
3793,Beth,Jeyne,"The Happy Port is  where all the porters go,The boys unload the  ships, Merry says, and my girls unload the lads who sail them.What about them fancy whores the singers sing about?"
3794,Beth,Chett,Are they as  pretty as they say?Where would I get one o them?
3795,Beth,Chett,"Seven hells, boy,Might be the  captain could get hisself a courty-san, but only if he sold the bloody ship.That sort o cunts for  lords and such, not for the likes o us."
3796,Brus,Brusco,"I sold three cockles to a courtesan,She called to me as she was stepping  off her barge."
3797,Brus,Brusco,"Which one was this, now?The Queen o Cockles, was it?The Black Pearl,"
3798,Brus,Brusco,"Shes descended from the dragons, that one,The  first Black Pearl was a pirate queen."
3799,Chett,Jacelyn,"What did she say to you, Cat?She said Ill take three cockles, and Do you have some hot sauce, little one?"
3800,Chett,Jacelyn,"And what did you say?I said, No, my lady, and, Dont call me little one."
3801,Chett,Jacelyn,"Beqqo does, and he sells three times as many oysters as Brusco."
3802,Chett,Jacelyn,"Her true name is Bellegere Otherys,"
3803,Chett,Jacelyn,"It is,Her mother was Bellonara, but the first Black Pearl was a  Bellegere as well."
3804,Chett,Jacelyn,War?
3805,Chett,Jacelyn,"What war?There is no war.Not in Gulltown,Not in the Vale.The little lords kept us out of it, same as his  mother did."
3806,Chett,Jacelyn,"Lady Lysa,is she..."
3807,Chett,Jacelyn,Aye.Murdered by her  own singer.Oh.
3808,Chett,Jacelyn,"Oysters,  clams, and cockles,Oysters, clams, and cockles."
3809,Chett,Jacelyn,"You come work with me, Cat,"
3810,Chett,Jacelyn,"I give you more than Brusco, and you would not smell like fish.Casso likes the way I smell,"
3811,Chett,Jacelyn,"Is Narbos  hand no better?Three fingers do not bend,What good is a  cutpurse who cannot use his fingers?Narbo was good at picking pockets, not so good at picking  whores.Merry says the same."
3812,Chett,Jacelyn,"What will  he do?Pull an oar, he says."
3813,Chett,Jacelyn,"Dont you,  Casso?"
3814,Chett,Dareon,Quence  finally came on Allaquo abed with Sloey.
3815,Chett,Dareon,"Well only be five drunken oarsmen tonight, it would seem.We shall strive to make up in drunkenness what we lack in oarsmen,I  for one am equal to the task.Little Narbo wants to be an oarsman,If you got him, youd have six.You had best go see Merry,You know how sour she gets without her oysters."
3816,Arya,Dareon,"I am done with  darkness,"
3817,Arya,Beth,"Hard beds, salt  cod, and endless watches, thats the Wall,Besides, theres no one half as pretty as  you at Eastwatch.How could I ever leave you?"
3818,Arya,Dareon,"He sings a pretty song,The gods must have loved him to give him such a  voice, and that fair face as well."
3819,Chett,Dareon,"She thinks that if she finds the right god, maybe  he will send the winds and blow her old love back to her,"
3820,Chett,Dareon,"If he  ever should come back to her, it will be a corpse."
3821,Chett,Dareon,"Theres oysters, if anyone is wanting some,Good,Bring them in, child.Yna, fetch some bread and vinegar."
3822,Brus,Dareon,"Every time I play the Eel I come away with silver,and some nights there are captains there, and owners."
3823,Brus,Dareon,"Soon I will be  playing in the Purple, and after that the Sealords Palace,"
3824,Brus,Dareon,"Yesterday I ate herring  with the whores, but within the year Ill be having emperor crab with courtesans.What happened to your brother?"
3825,Brus,Dareon,The fat one.
3826,Brus,Dareon,He said he was supposed to sail on the Lady Ushanora.We all were.
3827,Brus,Brusco,"I told Samwell leave the old man, but the fat fool would not  listen."
3828,Brus,Brusco,"Well, its too late now.Just so,"
3829,Brus,Brusco,"Good.But whats this?Boots.Good boots are hard to find,but these are too small for my feet."
3830,Brus,Brusco,"The moon will be black tonight,Best you pray, then."
3831,Brus,Brusco,Valar dohaeris.
3832,Chett,Jacelyn,"Sweetsleep is the gentlest of poisons,A few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking,  and make a man feel calm and strong."
3833,Arya,Chett,"Here, you can smell the sweetness."
3834,Arya,Chett,"This is a crueler poison, but  tasteless and odorless, hence easier to hide."
3835,Arya,Chett,Smell.
3836,Arya,Chett,This  paste is spiced with basilisk blood.
3837,Arya,Chett,A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of  basilisk blood.
3838,Arya,Chett,Would it work on dogs?On any animal with warm blood.
3839,Arya,Chett,Why did you do that?It is Arya of House Stark who chews on her lip whenever she is thinking.Are you Arya of  House Stark?I am no one.
3840,Arya,Chett,Who are you?
3841,Arya,Chett,"I was born the only child of an ancient  House, my noble fathers heir,My mother died when I was little, I have no  memory of her."
3842,Arya,Chett,"I was brought to the temple to serve, and my  fathers wife received the gift."
3843,Arya,Chett,"Is that true?There is truth in it.And lies as well?There is an untruth, and an exaggeration."
3844,Arya,Chett,"The Many-Faced God took two-thirds of your fathers wealth, not all.Just so.That was my exaggeration."
3845,Arya,Blue,What part was the lie?No part.I lied about the lie.Did you?Or are you lying now?
3846,Arya,Blue,"You have  returned to us.The moon is black.It is.What three new things do you know, that you did not know when last you left us?"
3847,Arya,Blue,Three of Little Narbos fingers will not bend.He  means to be an oarsman.It is good to know this.And what else?
3848,Arya,Blue,"Quence and Alaquo had a fight and left the Ship, but I think that  theyll come back.Do you only think, or do you know?I only think,"
3849,Arya,Blue,"Just so,And the third thing?"
3850,Arya,Blue,Dareon is dead.
3851,Arya,Blue,"Someone slit his throat and pushed  him into a canal, but they kept his boots.Good boots are hard to find.Just so."
3852,Arya,Blue,"Who could have done this thing, I wonder?Arya of House Stark."
3853,Arya,Dareon,That girl?
3854,Arya,Dareon,Who are you?No one.You lie.
3855,Arya,Dareon,"My throat is dry.Do me a kindness and bring a cup of wine  for me and warm milk for our friend Arya, who has returned to us so unexpectedly."
3856,Arya,Dareon,"Go to bed now, child,On the morrow you must serve."
3857,Chett,Samwell,"He was a good man,No."
3858,Aemon,Samwell,How many men would do that?
3859,Aemon,Gilly,"He was the blood of the dragon, but now  his fire has gone out."
3860,Aemon,Gilly,"And now his watch is ended.And now his watch is ended,"
3861,Gilly,Xhondo,"Black Samwellsaid good words,Now we  drink his life."
3862,Aemon,Gilly,"If only  we could have gotten him to Oldtown, the archmaesters might have saved him,The healers of the Citadel are  the best in the Seven Kingdoms."
3863,Daenerys,Reznak,
3864,Samwell,Xhondo,"No one ever looked for a girl,It was a prince that was promised, not a princess."
3865,Daenerys,Samwell,The dragons prove it.
3866,Daenerys,Samwell,I must go to her.
3867,Daenerys,Samwell,Would that I was even ten  years younger.
3868,Samwell,Xhondo,"They were  meant for the Citadel,"
3869,Aemon,Quhuru,"Quhuru Mo says the grey men will be having these  books still,only they will be buying them from Quhuru Mo."
3870,Aemon,Samwell,"You must tell them, SamwellThe archmaesters."
3871,Melisandre,Samwell,   Samwellpromised. the old man said.
3872,Daenerys,Reznak,  Tears ran from his blind white eyes at that admission.
3873,Gilly,Samwell,We know.
3874,Aemon,Baelor,"The dragon must have three heads,but I am too old and frail to be one of  them."
3875,Gilly,Samwell,"He was too frail for such a  long voyage,Jon should have  seen that."
3876,Aemon,Gilly,"If he  had stayed at Castle Black, he might have lived another ten years.Or else she might have burned him.The red woman."
3877,Gilly,Melisandre,She wanted kings blood for  her fires.
3878,Dalla,Samwell,"Maester Aemon went to sleep and didnt wake up, but if  he had stayed, she would have burned him."
3879,Dalla,Gilly,"The night before he died, he asked if he might hold the babe,I was afraid he  might drop him, but he never did."
3880,Dalla,Gilly,"The way he pulled his lip I thought he might be hurting him,  but it only made the old man laugh."
3881,Dalla,Gilly,"We could name the little one  Maester, if you like."
3882,Aemon,Gilly,"We could.Maester is not a name.You could call him Aemon, though."
3883,Aemon,Gilly,"Dalla brought him forth during battle, as the swords sang all around  her."
3884,Aemon,Gilly,Aemon Steelsong.
3885,Craster,Samwell,"Yes.Call him that.When he is two,not before.Where is the boy?"
3886,Gilly,Samwell,Kojja has him.I asked her to take him for a while.Oh.
3887,Gilly,Samwell,"That was kind of Kojja,I was afraid of her at first,She was so black, and her teeth were so big and white,  I was afraid she was a beastling or a monster, but shes not."
3888,Gilly,Samwell,I like her.I know you do.
3889,Gilly,Samwell,"I like you too, SamwellAnd I like this drink.It tastes like fire."
3890,Aemon,Samwell,"May the Father judge him justly,"
3891,Gilly,Samwell,"Ow,Are you hurt?"
3892,Gilly,Samwell,"We  cant,We can,"
3893,Gilly,Samwell,"I am your wife now,Yes."
3894,Samwell,Xhondo,"Wind is up,Wake and work, Black Samwell Wind is  up."
3895,Daenerys,Reznak,Black  Samwellis big fat man.
3896,Grenn,Xhondo,Fuck
3897,Gilly,Xhondo,"Swan ships,"
3898,Chett,Xhondo,"Black Samwellcome with Xhondo,"
3899,Chett,Xhondo,There is the  coast of Dorne.
3900,Chett,Xhondo,Or else you could go to Gilly.You do not understand.  
3901,Samwell,Xhondo,"Only a monster god, a demon of the darkness."
3902,Samwell,Xhondo,"The gods gave you this for a reason too, for... what is your Westerosi  word?Fucking,Yes, for fucking."
3903,Samwell,Xhondo,There is no shame in  that.
3904,Samwell,Xhondo,I took a vow.
3905,Samwell,Xhondo,I said the  words.She knows the words you said.
3906,Gilly,Samwell,"So you go to her, or swim."
3907,Gilly,Samwell,"What we did... if I could take a wife, I would sooner have you than any  princess or highborn maiden, but I cant."
3908,Gilly,Samwell,"I went with  Jon into the woods and said the words before a heart tree.The trees watch over us,In the forest,  they see all... but there are no trees here.Only water, Samwell Only water."
3909,Aurane,Cersei,"Your Grace,Dragonstone is yours.How splendid."
3910,Aurane,Cersei,"I know Tommen will be  pleased as well.This will mean that we can release Lord Redwynes fleet, and drive the ironmen  from the Shields."
3911,Euron,Tommen,"Lord Paxter was taking on provisions for the voyage home when Sweet Cersei raised sail,I would imagine that by now his main fleet has put to sea.Let us hope they enjoy a swift voyage, and better weather than today."
3912,Euron,Tommen,Do we have Ser Loras to thank for this triumph?
3913,Euron,Tommen,"Some will say so, Your Grace.Some?"
3914,Euron,Tommen,"Not you?I never saw a braver knight,"
3915,Loras,Tommen,"And not just common men, Your Grace, but knights and young lords, the best and  the bravest.And Ser Loras himself?He will make a thousand and one."
3916,Loras,Tommen,"He has lost so much blood that the maesters will not even leech him.Oh, how sad."
3917,Loras,Tommen,"He did so admire our gallant Knight of Flowers.The smallfolk too,Well have maidens weeping into their wine all across  the realm when Loras dies."
3918,Cersei,Loras,"Tell me,I want to know all of it, from the beginning to the end."
3919,Aurane,Dorcas,"I do not want our precious Margaery to hear these tidings from a stranger, after  all,I will tell her myself.Your Grace is kind,"
3920,Aurane,Cersei,"Your Grace,"
3921,Aurane,Margaery,Your brother is a hero.I always knew he was.
3922,Cersei,Loras,"Redwyne had miners working to drive  a tunnel underneath the castle walls, but that was too slow for the Knight of Flowers."
3923,Loras,Megga,"He rode straight into the dragons mouth, they say,  all in white and swinging his morningstar about his head, slaying left and right."
3924,Cersei,Megga,How did he die?
3925,Cersei,Megga,"Who killed him?No one man has that honor,Ser Loras took a quarrel through the thigh and  another through the shoulder, but he fought on gallantly, though the blood was streaming from  him."
3926,Cersei,Margaery,"After that... but no, I would spare you  the worst of it.Tell me,I command it."
3927,Alla,Loras,The defenders  fell back to an inner keep once the curtain wall was taken.
3928,Alla,Loras,He  was doused with boiling oil.
3929,Cersei,Margaery,"The maesters are doing all they can, Lord Waters assures me, but I fear your brother is too  badly burned."
3930,Cersei,Margaery,He saved the realm.
3931,Cersei,Margaery,"Jaime will enter  all his deeds in the White Book, and the singers will sing of him for a thousand years."
3932,Cersei,Margaery,"Dying is not  dead,No, but the maesters say...Dying is not dead!I only want to spare you...I know what you want."
3933,Cersei,Joffrey,Sweet daughter.
3934,Cersei,Joffrey,I will leave you with your grief.
3935,Loras,Margaery,"Margaery is still convinced he will not die,She plans to send her own maester to look after him.The cousins  are praying for the Mothers mercy.I shall pray as well.On the morrow, come with me to Baelors Sept, and we will light a  hundred candles for our gallant Knight of Flowers."
3936,Loras,Osmund,"Dorcas, bring  my crown.The new one, if you please."
3937,Jocelyn,Osmund,"There are four come about the Imp this morning,Four?"
3938,Osmund,Tyrion,"Aye,One brought a head for you.I will see him first.Bring him to my solar."
3939,Cersei,Tyrion,"Your Grace,"
3940,Cersei,Tyrion,"No man can restore your brave young son to you, but it is my hope I can at least offer you  some balm for your pain."
3941,Cersei,Tyrion,I bring you justice.I bring you the  head of your valonqar.
3942,Cersei,Tyrion,"The  Imp is no longer my brother, if he ever was,Nor will I say his name.It was a  proud name once, before he dishonored it.In Tyrosh we name him Redhands, for the blood running from his fingers."
3943,Cersei,Tyrion,"Some say he slew his mother too, ripping his way from her womb with savage claws."
3944,Cersei,Tyrion,"Tis true,If the Imps head is in that chest, I shall  raise you to lordship and grant you rich lands and keeps."
3945,Cersei,Loras,My court awaits.Open the box and let us see.
3946,Cersei,Loras,That is not my brother.
3947,Cersei,Loras,"This  man has brown eyes.Tyrion had one black eye and one green.The eyes, just so..."
3948,Cersei,Loras,"I took the  liberty of replacing them with glass... but of the wrong color, as you say."
3949,Cersei,Loras,"Your head may have glass eyes, but I do not."
3950,Cersei,Loras,What happened to his teeth?
3951,Cersei,Loras,"He had a fine set of gold teeth, Your Grace, but  we...  But you will."
3952,Cersei,Meryn,An honest mistake.
3953,Cersei,Meryn,  
3954,Cersei,Meryn,Yes.
3955,Cersei,Meryn,At least you had that much sense.
3956,Cersei,Meryn,"Ser Meryn, take this fraud to  Qyburn."
3957,Cersei,Osmund,"Ser Osmund, get this thing out of my sight,  and bring in the other three who claim knowledge of the Imp.Aye, Your Grace."
3958,Cersei,Tyrion,"If you will be so good  as to lead some of my brave knights to this dwarf, you shall be richly rewarded,Provided that it is the Imp."
3959,Cersei,Tyrion,A man could lose his tongue.
3960,Blue,Cersei,Is the whole world overrun with these  twisted little monsters?
3961,Blue,Cersei,"How many of them can there be?Fewer than there were,May I have the honor of accompanying  Your Grace to court?If you can bear the tedium,Robert was a fool about most things, but he was  right in one regard.It is wearisome work to rule a kingdom.It saddens me to see Your Grace so careworn."
3962,Jaime,Tommen,Would it amuse Your Grace to be a man one night?
3963,Taena,Tommen,"Only if you remained a woman,You are a wicked thing to tempt me so, but what sort of queen  would I be if I put my realm in the trembling hands of Harys Swyft?"
3964,Jalabhar,Taena,"Your Grace is too diligent.I am,and by days end I shall rue it."
3965,Jalabhar,Taena,Come.
3966,Daenerys,Reznak,
3967,Jalabhar,Robert,"Next year,  perhaps."
3968,Hallyne,Robert,"If any such eggs remained, Stannis would have sold them to pay for  his rebellion,"
3969,Cersei,Qyburn,Where is the High Septon?
3970,Cersei,Qyburn,It was him I summoned.
3971,Cersei,Qyburn,"His High Holiness sent me in his stead, and bade me  tell Your Grace that the Seven have sent him forth to battle wickedness.How?"
3972,Cersei,Qyburn,"Does he think praying over whores will  turn them back to virgins?Our bodies were shaped by our Father and Mother so we might join male to female and beget  trueborn children,It is base and sinful for women to sell their holy parts for  coin."
3973,Gyles,Pycelle,"Do not presume to  preach at me,The brothel keepers have been complaining, and rightly so.If sinners speak, why should the righteous listen?These sinners feed the royal coffers,"
3974,Gyles,Pycelle,Henceforth let His High Holiness do his praying  in the sept where it belongs.
3975,Garth,Mace,"Sad  to say, I fear Lord Gyles must join his noble forebears soon.May the Father judge him justly."
3976,Garth,Pycelle,"Lord Gyles has had that cough for years, and it never killed him before,He  coughed through half of Roberts reign and all of Joffreys.If he is dying now, it can only be  because someone wants him dead."
3977,Margaery,Pycelle,"Your Grace?Wh-who would want Lord Gyles  dead?His heir, perhaps."
3978,Mace,Margaery,Some woman he once scorned.
3979,Gyles,Mace,An old enemy.
3980,Gyles,Pycelle,You.
3981,Gyles,Pycelle,Y-your Grace japes.
3982,Gyles,Pycelle,"I have purged his lordship, bled him, treated  him with poultices and infusions... the mists give him some relief and sweetsleep helps with the  violence of his coughing, but he is bringing up bits of lung with the blood now, I fear.Be that as it may.You will return to Lord Gyles and inform him that he does not have my  leave to die.If it please Your Grace."
3983,Daenerys,Reznak,
3984,Loras,Tommen,"Every one wants a piece of your flesh.Yes, Mother,"
3985,Loras,Margaery,"I wouldnt mind them pecking, though,I should go to court with you every day, to listen.   Cersei snapped. Tommen shouted suddenly, his round little face turning red."
3986,Cersei,Tommen,"Im the king, not you."
3987,Cersei,Margaery,What did you say?Im the king.
3988,Cersei,Margaery,I forbid it.
3989,Boros,Pate,"Ser Boros, His Grace has forgotten himself."
3990,Boros,Tommen,"If His Grace refuses, or says one word of  protest, summon Qyburn and tell him to remove Pates tongue, so His Grace can learn the cost of  insolence.As you command,Your Grace, please come  with me."
3991,Dorcas,Loras,"Such a dark night, Your Grace,"
3992,Jeyne,Mag,"Wake up, we want  our futures told."
3993,Cersei,Melara,"Begone,We came for a foretelling,Begone,We heard that you can see into the morrow,We just want to know what men  were going to marry.Begone,"
3994,Mag,Melara,"Give us our foretelling, or Ill go to  my lord father and have you whipped for insolence.Please,Just tell us our futures, then well go.Some are here who have no futures,"
3995,Cersei,Melara,"Come, if you will not go."
3996,Cersei,Melara,I must taste your blood.
3997,Cersei,Mag,"Here,give it here."
3998,Cersei,Mag,"Three questions may you ask,You will not like my  answers.Ask, or begone with you."
3999,Aerys,Mag,When will I wed the prince?
4000,Aerys,Mag,Never.You will wed the king.
4001,Aerys,Mag,"I  will be queen, though?"
4002,Aerys,Mag,Aye.
4003,Aerys,Mag,"Queen you shall be... until there comes  another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear."
4004,Aerys,Mag,If she tries I will have my brother kill her.
4005,Cersei,Mag,Will the king and I have children?
4006,Cersei,Mag,"Oh, aye.Six-and-ten for him, and three for you."
4007,Cersei,Melara,"Gold shall be their crowns and gold their  shrouds,And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands  about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.What is a valonqar?Some monster?"
4008,Cersei,Melara,"Youre a  liar and a warty frog and a smelly old savage, and I dont believe a word of what you say."
4009,Cersei,Melara,"She is not worth hearing.I get three questions too,"
4010,Cersei,Jaime,Will I marry Jaime?
4011,Cersei,Mag,"Not Jaime, nor any other man,Worms will have your maidenhead."
4012,Cersei,Mag,"She is very close.The only breath we smell is yours,"
4013,Dorcas,Gyles,"Wake up, and find Pycelle."
4014,Dorcas,Gyles,Fetch him here at once.
4015,Cersei,Tyrion,How old are you?
4016,Aegon,Cersei,"Four-and-eighty, if it please Your Grace.A younger man would please me more."
4017,Aegon,Cersei,I was but two-and-forty when the Conclave called me.
4018,Aegon,Tommen,He was the first king I served.
4019,Aegon,Tommen,I need a potion from you.Something to help me sleep.A cup of wine before bed will oft...
4020,Qyburn,Tommen,Something that will not let me  dream.You...Your Grace does not wish to dream?What did I just say?
4021,Qyburn,Tommen,"Can you make me such a  potion, or must I command Lord Qyburn to rectify another of your failures?No."
4022,Qyburn,Tommen,You shall have  your potion.Good.You may go.
4023,Qyburn,Tommen,One more  thing.
4024,Qyburn,Tommen,Can our morrows be foretold?
4025,Qyburn,Tommen,Can our morrows be foretold?
4026,Qyburn,Tommen,Mayhaps.
4027,Pate,Tommen,Some doors are best left closed.See that you close mine as you leave.
4028,Cersei,Qyburn,"Go with Jocelyn,"
4029,Cersei,Qyburn,"Is Lady Falyse still alive?Alive, yes."
4030,Cersei,Qyburn,comfortable.I see.
4031,Cersei,Qyburn,This man Bronn...
4032,Lollys,Qyburn,   said Qyburn.
4033,Lollys,Qyburn,I hope I have not exceeded Your Graces  instructions.No.
4034,Lollys,Qyburn,"There is another matter.Last night I had a  dreadful dream.All men are so afflicted, from time to time.This dream concerned a witch woman I visited as a child.A woods witch?"
4035,Cersei,Chett,  
4036,Cersei,Melara,"The smallfolk used  to call her Maggy.Maegi?Is that how you say it?The woman would suck a drop of blood from your finger, and tell you  what your morrows held.Bloodmagic is the darkest kind of sorcery.Some say it is the most powerful as well."
4037,Cersei,Melara,This maegi made certain prophecies.
4038,Cersei,Melara,Yet she soon fell down a well  and drowned.
4039,Melara,Qyburn,Do you still grieve for this friend of your childhood?
4040,Melara,Qyburn,"Is that what troubles  you, Your Grace?Melara?"
4041,Daenerys,Reznak,"  Younger and more beautiful, she said."
4042,Jaime,Robert,"Can it be forestalled?Oh, yes.Never doubt that.How?I think Your Grace knows how."
4043,Jaime,Robert,If she tries I will have my brother  kill her.
4044,Osmund,Osney,"Walk with  me a bit,"
4045,Osmund,Osney,How good a sword is he?Good.
4046,Osmund,Osney,"Hes not as strong as me nor Osfryd, but hes quick to the kill.If it came to it, could he defeat Ser Boros Blount?Boros the Belly?"
4047,Osmund,Osney,"Hes what, forty?"
4048,Boros,Osney,"Has Boros done some treason?No,"
4049,Brienne,Podrick,What does he have in his mouth?
4050,Brienne,Meribald,"Salt,"
4051,Brienne,Hyle,"What do you have there, Dog?"
4052,Brienne,Hyle,"Good  steel,and not too badly dinted, though the lions lost his head."
4053,Brienne,Podrick,"It is too big for him.Hell grow into it.I dont want to,"
4054,Hyle,Meribald,"These are the men  who raided Saltpans.May the Father judge them harshly,"
4055,Hyle,Meribald,Shall we keep a brisker pace?
4056,Hyle,Meribald,"I doubt that death will have improved them.There we disagree,These are just the sort of fellows who are most improved  by death."
4057,Meribald,Podrick,"The Old Inn, some call it."
4058,Meribald,Podrick,"When the wind blew it would clank and clatter, so the  inn became known far and wide as the Clanking Dragon.Is the dragon sign still there?"
4059,Meribald,Podrick,"No,When the smiths son was an old man, a bastard son of the fourth  Aegon rose up in rebellion against his trueborn brother and took for his sigil a black dragon."
4060,Chett,Podrick,"There was a ferry landing here as well, so  travelers could cross to Lord Harroways Town and Whitewalls.We left the Trident south of here, and have been riding north and west... not toward the river  but away from it.Aye, my lady,The river moved."
4061,Hyle,Podrick,"When she did not have a  room for me, she would let me sleep beside the hearth, and she never sent me on my way without  some bread and cheese and a few stale cakes.Is she the innkeep now?"
4062,Hyle,Podrick,No.
4063,Hyle,Meribald,"Some lord killed him  as well, I hear."
4064,Hyle,Meribald,"I never dreamed that keeping an inn could be so deadly dangerous.It is being common-born that is dangerous, when the great lords play their game of thrones,Isnt that so, Dog?"
4065,Hyle,Meribald,"So,does the inn have a name now?The smallfolk call it the crossroads inn.Elder Brother told me that two of Masha Heddles  nieces have opened it to trade once again."
4066,Hyle,Meribald,"If the gods are good, that smoke  rising beyond the hanged men will be from its chimneys.They could call the place the Gallows Inn,"
4067,Hyle,Meribald,"I am a holy septon, good lady,and these are honest travelers."
4068,Hyle,Meribald,"The closest inn  is at the crossroads, to the west,We want no strangers here.Begone."
4069,Brienne,Hyle,"A forge,Either they have themselves a smith, or the old innkeeps ghost is  making another iron dragon."
4070,Brienne,Hyle,I hope they have a ghostly cook as  well.A crisp roast chicken would set the world aright.
4071,Brienne,Meribald,"Girls,run and fetch your mother."
4072,Brienne,Meribald,"We have no mothers,I had one but  they killed her."
4073,Brienne,Meribald,Who are you?
4074,Brienne,Meribald,Honest travelers seeking shelter.
4075,Brienne,Meribald,"The boy is my squire, Podrick Payne, the knight Ser Hyle  Hunt."
4076,Hyle,Meribald,"Im Willow.Will you be wanting beds?Beds, and ale, and hot food to fill our bellies,Are you  the innkeep?"
4077,Hyle,Meribald,Thats my sister Jeyne.
4078,Hyle,Willow,"Some  featherbeds, but more are straw.And all have fleas, I dont doubt,Do you have coin to pay?Silver?"
4079,Hyle,Willow,Silver?
4080,Hyle,Willow,"Do you mean to rob us,  child?Well have silver.Else you can sleep in the woods with the dead men."
4081,Hyle,Meribald,"Is that food?Where did you get it?Maidenpool,"
4082,Hyle,Meribald,Do you question all your guests this way?
4083,Hyle,Meribald,We dont have so many guests.
4084,Brienne,Hyle,"Its mostly sparrows on the roads  these days, or worse.Worse?"
4085,Brienne,Hyle,"Thieves,Robbers."
4086,Brienne,Renly,My lord?
4087,Brienne,Renly,Lord?
4088,Brienne,Renly,Im just a  smith.
4089,Hyle,Meribald,"We mean no harm, lad."
4090,Brienne,Hyle,"Sometimes she even let me have a bed, if the inn was not full.Shes dead,The lions hanged her.Hanging seems your favorite sport in these parts,Would that I had some  land hereabouts.Id plant hemp, sell rope, and make my fortune.All these children,Are they your... sisters?"
4091,Brienne,Willow,Kin  and cousins?No.
4092,Meribald,Willow,Theyre just...
4093,Meribald,Willow,"If youre a woman, why  are you dressed up like a man?"
4094,Meribald,Willow,Lady Brienne is a warrior maid upon a quest.
4095,Meribald,Willow,"Do you have rooms for us?No,Yes,"
4096,Hyle,Willow,"They have food, Gendry.The little  ones are hungry."
4097,Brienne,Hyle,"They could call it Crossbow Inn,"
4098,Brienne,Willow,"Wat, you help them with those horses,Will, put down that rock, theyve not  come to hurt us."
4099,Jon,Penny,Ill show them to some rooms.
4100,Brienne,Podrick,"Will I sleep in your room, or Ser Hyles?"
4101,Meribald,Podrick,"This is not the Quiet Isle,You can stay with me."
4102,Brienne,Sansa,"I mean to rise before the sun comes up, whilst Ser Hyle is  still sleeping."
4103,Brienne,Sansa,"Where will we go, ser?I mean, my lady?"
4104,Brienne,Jaime,Ser?
4105,Brienne,Jaime,"I asked, where are we going?Down to the common room, to supper."
4106,Hyle,Meribald,"Alas, my oranges are   gone, and I doubt that I shall see another till the spring,Have you ever  had an orange, lad?Squeezed one and sucked down that fine juice?"
4107,Brienne,Hyle,"Then Ill bring you one, come spring, if you will be a good  lad and help me stir the porridge."
4108,Brienne,Hyle,"There are bloodstains on the floor over there where Dog is  sniffing.Theyve been scrubbed, but the blood soaked deep into the wood, and theres no getting  it out.This is the inn where Sandor Clegane killed three of his brothers men,Tis that,but who is to say that they were the first to die here... or that theyll  be the last.Are you afraid of a few children?Four would be a few."
4109,Brienne,Hyle,Children should be wrapped  in swaddling clothes and hung upon the wall until the girls grow breasts and the boys are old  enough to shave.I feel sorry for them.
4110,Brienne,Hyle,Some have seen them  slain.
4111,Brienne,Hyle,I forgot that I was talking to a woman.
4112,Hyle,Renly,What you really want is a sweet pink babe to suckle at your teat.
4113,Hyle,Renly,"You need a man for that, I hear."
4114,Hyle,Renly,Why not me?If you still hope to win your wager...
4115,Brienne,Renly,"Lands for me, and a castle full of these for you."
4116,Brienne,Renly,"I am capable, I assure you."
4117,Brienne,Meribald,"The last time I went to see her, her mother doused  me with a kettle of soup."
4118,Brienne,Meribald,"My fathers only four-and-fifty.Not too old to wed again and get a  son by his new wife.Thats a risk... if your father weds again and if his bride proves fertile and if the babes a boy.Ive made worse wagers.And lost them.Play your game with someone else, ser.So speaks a maid who has never played the game with anyone."
4119,Brienne,Meribald,"Your lips were made for  kissing.They are lips,All lips are the same.And all lips are made for kissing,Leave your chamber door  unbarred tonight, and I will steal into your bed and prove the truth of what I say.If you do, youll be a eunuch when you leave."
4120,Meribald,Willow,"Aye,"
4121,Gendry,Meribald,"Do you have no love for the gods,  son?Not for your gods."
4122,Gendry,Hyle,I have work to do.
4123,Gendry,Hyle,Is there some other god he loves?
4124,Hyle,Willow,"The Lord of Light,"
4125,Hyle,Willow,Ben Big Mouth.
4126,Hyle,Willow,"You should be eating it, not  bothering mlords with talk."
4127,Hyle,Willow,"One day that little girl will make some man a  frightful wife,That poor prentice boy, most like.Someone should take him some food before its all gone.Youre someone."
4128,Brienne,Podrick,I will not be long.
4129,Gendry,Robert,What do you  want?I brought supper.
4130,Gendry,Robert,"If I wanted food, I would have eaten some.A smith needs to eat to keep his strength up.Are you my mother?No."
4131,Brienne,Gendry,Who was your mother?Whats that to you?You were born in Kings Landing.
4132,Brienne,Gendry,Me and many more.
4133,Baelor,Brienne,How old are you?
4134,Baelor,Brienne,"Is your mother still alive?And your father, who was he?You ask too many questions."
4135,Baelor,Brienne,My mothers dead and I never knew  my father.Youre a bastard.
4136,Baelor,Brienne,"Im a knight.That sword will be mine own, once its done."
4137,Baelor,Brienne,"You have black hair and blue eyes, and  you were born in the shadow of the Red Keep.Has no one ever remarked upon your face?Whats wrong with my face?Its not as ugly as yours.In Kings Landing you must have seen King Robert."
4138,Baelor,Brienne,Sometimes.
4139,Renly,Stannis,"A big fat sot, he was, but a better  king than these sons of his."
4140,Brienne,Robert,"Listen to me,"
4141,Brienne,Gendry,"Someone is coming.Friends,What sort of friends?"
4142,Brienne,Gendry,Youll meet them soon enough.
4143,Brienne,Gendry,"Gendry,"
4144,Brienne,Gendry,Theyre no ones friends.What are you talking about?
4145,Brienne,Gendry,Him.Not him.His helm.
4146,Daenerys,Reznak,Loose a quarrel at me and  Ill shove that crossbow up your cunt and fuck you with it.
4147,Brienne,Willow,"Leave her be.If you want to rape someone,  try me."
4148,Brienne,Willow,"Youre even uglier than I remembered.Id sooner rape your  horse.Horses, thats what we want,Fresh horses, and some food."
4149,Brienne,Chett,We wont do you harm.Fuck that.
4150,Brienne,Chett,I want to cut  her bloody legs off.Ill set her on her stumps so she can watch me fuck the crossbow girl.With what?
4151,Brienne,Chett,Shagwell said they cut your manhood off when they took your  nose.
4152,Brienne,Chett,Whore!
4153,Brienne,Chett,Freak!
4154,Brienne,Chett,"Ill  give you to my dog to fuck, you bloody bitch!"
4155,Brienne,Chett,You got the bitch!Lets see her dance away  from that one.
4156,Biter,Brienne,"Sapphires,"
4157,Biter,Chett,"No,"
4158,Brynden,Jaime,"Kingslayer,"
4159,Brynden,Jaime,"Brynden,Thank you for coming.I assume you have returned to fulfill the oaths you swore my niece,As I  recall, you promised Catelyn her daughters in return for your freedom."
4160,Brynden,Jaime,Yet I do not see the girls.Where are they?
4161,Brynden,Jaime,I do not have them.Pity.
4162,Brynden,Catelyn,We have put fresh  rushes on the floor.
4163,Brienne,Catelyn,"That was thoughtful of you, ser, but I fear  I must decline.I prefer the comforts of my pavilion.Whilst Catelyn enjoys the comforts of her grave."
4164,Brynden,Eddard,"I came to speak of the  living, not the dead.  Is this where you threaten to hang Edmure?"
4165,Edmure,Ryman,My nephew is marked for death no matter what I do.
4166,Edmure,Ryman,I expect that Edmure is as weary of standing on those gallows as I am of  seeing him there.
4167,Brynden,Jaime,You hold Lady Sybelle Westerling and three of her  children.Ill return your nephew in exchange for them.As you returned Lady Catelyns daughters?
4168,Brynden,Jaime,An old woman and three children for your liege  lord.Thats a better bargain than you could have hoped for.
4169,Brynden,Jaime,"You do not lack for gall, Kingslayer."
4170,Jaime,Tyrion,Cat should have known better than to trust  the likes of you.
4171,Jaime,Tyrion,The promises I  made to Lady Catelyn were wrung from me at swordpoint.And the oath you swore to Aerys?
4172,Jaime,Tyrion,Aerys is no part of this.Will you exchange the  Westerlings for Edmure?No.
4173,Brynden,Jaime,I will not hand  her over to a Frey noose.The girl has been pardoned.
4174,Brynden,Emmon,You have my word on that.Your word of honor?
4175,Brynden,Emmon,Do you even know what honor is?
4176,Brynden,Emmon,"I will swear any oath that you require.Spare me, Kingslayer.I want to."
4177,Beric,Emmon,"The rest shall be free to go  where they will, though I will require them to surrender their arms and armor.I wonder, how far will they get, unarmed, before outlaws set upon them?"
4178,Beric,Brynden,Will I be paraded through Kings  Landing to die like Eddard Stark?I will permit you to take the black.Eddard Starks bastard is the Lord Commander on the Wall.
4179,Brynden,Catelyn,Did your father arrange for that as well?
4180,Jaime,Theon,"Ill die warm, if you please, with a sword in hand  running red with lion blood.Tully blood runs just as red,If you will not yield the castle, I must  storm it.Hundreds will die.Hundreds of mine.Thousands of yours.Your garrison will perish to a man.I know that song."
4181,Jaime,Theon,My men would  sooner die upon their feet fighting than on their knees beneath a headsmans axe.
4182,Harren,Jaime,"This defiance serves no purpose, ser.The war is done, and your Young  Wolf is dead.Murdered in breach of all the sacred laws of hospitality.Freys work, not mine.Call it what you will.It stinks of Tywin Lannister."
4183,Harren,Jaime,My father is dead as well.May the Father judge him justly.
4184,Harren,Jaime,"I would have slain Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood, if I  could have reached him."
4185,Harren,Jaime,"Hes  no less dead, and his kingdom died when he did.You must be blind as well as maimed, ser.Lift your eyes, and you will see that the direwolf  still flies above our walls.Ive seen him."
4186,Brynden,Tytos,"We have twenty times your  numbers.Twenty times the men require twenty times the food.How well are you provisioned, my  lord?Well enough to sit here till the end of days if need be, whilst you starve inside your walls."
4187,Brynden,Jaime,"The end of your days, perhaps.Our own supplies are ample,  though I fear we did not leave much in the fields for visitors.We can bring food down from the Twins,or over the hills from the west, if it  comes to that.If you say so.Far be it from me to question the word of such an honorable knight."
4188,Brynden,Jaime,There is a quicker way to decide the matter.
4189,Brynden,Jaime,My champion against yours.I was wondering when you would get to that.
4190,Addam,Brynden,Who will it be?
4191,Addam,Brynden,Black Walder Frey?
4192,Addam,Jaime,"Why not you and me,  ser?"
4193,Brynden,Jaime,"When  Lady Catelyn freed me, she made me swear not to take arms again against the Starks or Tullys.A most convenient oath, ser."
4194,Brynden,Jaime,Are you calling me a coward?No.I am calling you a cripple.
4195,Brynden,Jaime,We both know  you cannot fight with that.I had two hands.
4196,Catelyn,Jaime,Some might say a cripple and an old man are well matched.
4197,Brynden,Catelyn,"If you slay me, well lift  the siege."
4198,Brynden,Jaime,"Much as I would welcome the chance to take that golden sword  away from you and cut out your black heart, your promises are worthless.I would gain nothing  from your death but the pleasure of killing you, and I will not risk my own life for that... as small  a risk as that may be."
4199,Brynden,Jaime,Are there any  terms you will accept?
4200,Brynden,Jaime,From you?
4201,Brynden,Jaime,No.Why did you even come to treat with me?A siege is deadly dull.
4202,Brynden,Jaime,"You always  disappoint, Kingslayer."
4203,Brynden,Daven,"How did you fare, my lord?"
4204,Brynden,Daven,"No one put an arrow in my horses rump.Elsewise, there was little to distinguish me from Ser  Ryman."
4205,Brynden,Daven,So now he must needs turn the Red Fork redder.
4206,Addam,Brynden,Assemble a war council.
4207,Addam,Forley,"Ser Ryman, Lord Emmon,  whoever else they care to bring."
4208,Ryman,Walder,"Bastard Walder,"
4209,Daven,Edwyn,"I speak for House Frey,My father is indisposed this  morning."
4210,Daven,Edwyn,"Is he drunk, or just greensick from last nights wine?"
4211,Edwyn,Jaime,"Lord Jaime,must I suffer such  discourtesy?Is it true?"
4212,Ilyn,Jaime,Is your father drunk?
4213,Daven,Genna,"He... my father has a bad  belly, my lord.Red wine helps with his digestion.He must be digesting a bloody mammoth,"
4214,Genna,Jaime,"Enough,We have a castle to win."
4215,Emmon,Karyl,"How shall we proceed?Hang Edmure Tully, for a start,That will teach Ser Brynden that  we mean what we say.If we send Ser Edmures head to his uncle, it may move him to yield.Brynden Brynden is not moved so easily."
4216,Daven,Karyl,His own  brother could not move him to a marriage bed.
4217,Daven,Edwyn,"We have to storm the walls, as Ive been saying all along.Siege towers, scaling ladders, a ram to break the gate, thats whats needed here.I will lead the assault,Give the fish a taste of steel and fire, thats what I  say.They are my walls,and that is my gate you would break."
4218,Addam,Edwyn,"King Tommen himself has granted me...Weve all seen your paper, nuncle,Why dont you go wave it at the  Brynden for a change?Storming the walls will be a bloody business,I propose we wait for a  moonless night and send a dozen picked men across the river in a boat with muffled oars."
4219,Edwyn,Walder,"I will lead them,  if the council wishes.Folly,Ser Brynden is no man to be cozened by such  tricks.The Brynden is the obstacle,His helm bears a black trout on its crest  that makes him easy to pick out from afar."
4220,Emmon,Karyl,"Once Ser Brynden dies, Riverrun is ours.Mine,Riverrun is mine."
4221,Emmon,Karyl,"Will the night soil be your own contribution, Edwyn?A  mortal poison, I dont doubt.The Brynden deserves a nobler death, and Im the man to give it to him."
4222,Forley,Mace,I will challenge him to single combat.
4223,Forley,Mace,"The old man will be my meat.Why would he deign to accept your challenge, ser?"
4224,Forley,Mace,What could he  gain from such a duel?
4225,Forley,Mace,"A single combat would accomplish nought.I have known Brynden Tully since we were squires together, in service to Lord Darry,If it please my lords, let me go and speak with him  and try to make him understand the hopelessness of his position.He understands that well enough,"
4226,Edwyn,Jaime,"The mans not bloody stupid, Norbert.He has eyes... and too much sense to   yield to such as these."
4227,Edwyn,Walder,If my lord of Piper means to imply...
4228,Edwyn,Walder,Id sooner  drink a pint of piss than take the word of any Frey.
4229,Edwyn,Jaime,"Where is Marq,  answer me that?"
4230,Edwyn,Jaime,"He was a guest at your bloody wedding.And our honored guest he shall remain,until you prove your loyalty to His  Grace, King Tommen.Five knights and twenty men-at-arms went with Marq to the Twins,Are they  your guests as well, Frey?Some of the knights, perhaps."
4231,Jaime,Walder,"Youd do  well to guard your traitors tongue, Piper, unless you want your heir returned in pieces."
4232,Jaime,Walder,"Say that with a sword in your hand, Frey,Or do you only fight with  smears of shit?"
4233,Jaime,Walder,"Edwyn is no man of the  sword... but I am, Piper.If you have more remarks to make, come outside and make them.This is a war council, not a war,Sit down, the both of you."
4234,Jaime,Walder,Now!
4235,Daven,Jaime,"Shall I send men after him to drag him back, my lord?"
4236,Daven,Jaime,"Send Ser Ilyn,We only need his head."
4237,Jaime,Marq,Lord Piper spoke from grief.
4238,Edwyn,Marq,"Those  knights who accompanied him to the Twins were nephews and cousins all.Traitors and rebels all, you mean,"
4239,Edwyn,Jaime,"The Twins took up the Young Wolfs cause as well,Then you betrayed him.That makes you twice as treacherous as Piper."
4240,Edwyn,Jaime,Were done.
4241,Edwyn,Jaime,We attack at first light.
4242,Edmure,Tommen,"Lord nephew,this assault  on my seat... you must not do this."
4243,Genna,Tommen,You must not.
4244,Genna,Tommen,I forbid it.
4245,Genna,Tommen,"The castle is mine, I have the parchment."
4246,Genna,Tommen,    said Lady Genna.
4247,Edmure,Lyle,Leave Edmure to me.
4248,Ilyn,Lyle,Its time I paid a visit to those gallows.
4249,Ilyn,Lyle,"Here, pleasure my friend,"
4250,Robb,Ryman,"Ser Jaime,"
4251,Edmure,Jaime,"You cant go up without Ser Rymans leave,This says I can."
4252,Edmure,Jaime,"The question is, will I need to step  over your corpse?"
4253,Ilyn,Jaime,Kingslayer?
4254,Ilyn,Jaime,"Better a  sword than a rope.Do it, Payne.Ser Ilyn,You heard Lord Tully.Do it."
4255,Edwyn,Jaime,No!
4256,Edwyn,Jaime,NO!
4257,Edwyn,Jaime,My father comes.
4258,Jaime,Ryman,   said Jaime.
4259,Jaime,Ryman,"Who in seven hells is this one?The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,I might ask the  same of you, my lady.Lady?"
4260,Jaime,Ryman,Im the queen.My sister will be surprised to hear that.Lord Ryman crowned me his very self.
4261,Jaime,Ryman,Im the queen o  whores.
4262,Jaime,Ryman,"Shut your mouth, slut, Lord Jaime doesnt want to hear some  harlots nonsense."
4263,Edmure,Jaime,"Making queens, Ser Ryman?"
4264,Edmure,Jaime,Stupid.As stupid as this business with  Lord Edmure.I gave the Brynden warning.
4265,Brynden,Jaime,  
4266,Brynden,Jaime,"My lord grandfather... if we hang the man we have no hostage, ser.Have  you considered that?Only a fool makes threats hes not prepared to carry out.If I were to threaten to hit you unless  you shut your mouth, and you presumed to speak, what do you think Id do?Ser, you do not unders..."
4267,Ilyn,Ryman,"You have a fat head, Ser Ryman,  and a thick neck as well.Ser Ilyn, how many strokes would it take you to cut through that neck?"
4268,Jaime,Ryman,An empty boast.I say three.
4269,Jaime,Ryman,I have done nothing...... but drink and whore.You cant...I warned you about talking.
4270,Jaime,Walder,"You are dismissed, ser.Dismissed?You heard me.Go away.But... where should I go?To hell or home, as you prefer."
4271,Jaime,Ryman,"You may  take your queen of whores, but not that crown of hers."
4272,Jaime,Ryman,"Edwyn, I am giving you your fathers command.Try not to be so stupid as your sire.That ought not pose much difficulty, my lord.Send word to Lord Walder.The crown requires all his prisoners."
4273,Edmure,Jaime,"Ser Lyle, bring him."
4274,Ilyn,Jaime,"A fish on a leash,Theres a sight I never saw  before."
4275,Jaime,Ryman,You.
4276,Jaime,Ryman,Come with me.
4277,Jaime,Ryman,As my lord commands.
4278,Edmure,Jaime,Why?
4279,Edmure,Jaime,Consider it a  wedding gift.
4280,Edmure,Roslin,"A... wedding gift?I am told your wife is pretty.Shed have to be, for you to bed her while your sister and your  king were being murdered.I never knew."
4281,Edmure,Roslin,"There were fiddlers outside the bedchamber..And Lady Roslin was distracting you.She... they made her do it, Lord Walder and the rest.  Aye, that would make any woman weep, Im sure.She is carrying my child."
4282,Ilyn,Pia,"I may have need of a song shortly,Lew, heat some bathwater for my guest."
4283,Edmure,Jaime,"Are you hungry, my lord?"
4284,Edmure,Jaime,"Once  youve eaten, my men will escort you to Riverrun.What happens after that is up to you.What do you mean?Your uncle is an old man."
4285,Edmure,Emmon,The fate of Riverrun is in your hands.
4286,Edmure,Emmon,The fate of Riverrun...
4287,Edmure,Pia,All you need do is yield the castle.
4288,Edmure,Pia,And if I  will not yield?
4289,Daenerys,Reznak,
4290,Edmure,Jaime,By the  time Im done no man will ever know that a castle once stood here.
4291,Edmure,Jaime,Your  wife may whelp before that.
4292,Edmure,Pia,With a trebuchet.
4293,Edmure,Jaime,"I could climb out of this tub and kill you where you  stand, Kingslayer.You could try."
4294,Daenerys,Reznak,
4295,Edmure,Jaime,"You know the song, I trust.The one about the rain?"
4296,Edmure,Jaime,I know it.
4297,Edmure,Jaime,No.
4298,Edmure,Jaime,"Get him away from me.Why, its just a song,He cannot have that bad a voice."
4299,Cersei,Osmund,"Lord Qyburn informs me that Lord Gyles has coughed his  last.Yes, Your Grace.I did my best to ease his passing.Did you?"
4300,Cersei,Pycelle,"I did say I wanted Rosby alive, did I  not?You did, Your Grace.Ser Osmund, what is your recollection of the conversation?You commanded Grand Maester Pycelle to save the man, Your Grace.We all heard."
4301,Pycelle,Robert,"Your Grace must know, I did all that could be done for  the poor man.As you did for Joffrey?"
4302,Eddard,Jon,"Tell me,  maester, was it at the Citadel that you learned to wring your hands and make excuses?"
4303,Eddard,Jon,"No man could have done more, Your Grace."
4304,Eddard,Moon,"I have  always given leal service.When you counseled King Aerys to open his gates as my fathers host approached, was that  your notion of leal service?That...    What I know is that the crown has desperate need of gold, and our lord treasurer is dead."
4305,Cersei,Moon,I...I shall draw up a list of men suitable to take Lord Gyless  place upon the council.A list.
4306,Cersei,Margaery,I can well imagine the sort of list you would  provide me.Greybeards and grasping fools and Garth the Gross.
4307,Cersei,Margaery,You have  been much in Lady Margaerys company of late.Yes.
4308,Loras,Pycelle,"I provide Her Grace  with sleeping draughts and... other sorts of potions.No doubt.Tell me, was it our little queen who commanded you to kill Lord Gyles?K-kill?"
4309,Gyles,Pycelle,"Your Grace cannot  believe... it was his cough, by all the gods, I...   "
4310,Pycelle,Tommen,"With your connivance.Your Grace, I swear to you, Lord Gyles perished from his cough."
4311,Pycelle,Tommen,"My loyalty has always been to the crown, to the realm... t-to House Lannister."
4312,Margaery,Pycelle,"If you are as leal as you claim, why are you lying to me?"
4313,Loras,Margaery,"Do you play the spy for her,  informing on me to serve her plots?I..."
4314,Margaery,Pycelle,      
4315,Margaery,Pycelle,Is my good-daughter  unwell?Unwell?
4316,Osmund,Pycelle,"N-not unwell, Your Grace, not  as such.   she warned him."
4317,Osmund,Pycelle,I beg you...
4318,Osmund,Pycelle,    
4319,Osmund,Pycelle,"Moon tea,Moon tea, for...I know what moon tea is for."
4320,Osmund,Pycelle,Very well.Get off those saggy knees and try to  remember what it was to be a man.
4321,Cersei,Osmund,"As to Lord Gyles, no doubt our  Father Above will judge him justly.He left no children?No children of his body, but there is a ward...... not of his blood."
4322,Cersei,Osmund,Gyles knew of  our dire need for gold.No doubt he told you of his wish to leave all his lands and wealth to  Tommen.
4323,Cersei,Gyles,"Lord Gyles loved His Grace with all his heart,but... his ward...... will doubtless understand, once he hears you speak of Lord Gyless dying wish."
4324,Gyles,Pycelle,"Moon tea,How foolish of her.Why would she do such a thing, take such a risk?The little queen has appetites that Tommen is as yet too young to satisfy."
4325,Mace,Margaery,My son has been betrayed.
4326,Mace,Margaery,"That  is high treason, punishable by death."
4327,Olenna,Osmund,"Jaime  made off with Ser Ilyn Payne.I suppose I shall need to find a new Kings Justice to snick her  head off.Ill do it,Margaerys got a pretty little neck.A good sharp sword will go right through it.It would,but there is a Tyrell army at Storms End and another at Maidenpool."
4328,Qyburn,Stannis,"Treason is treason,but we must  have proof, something more substantial than moon tea."
4329,Qyburn,Stannis,We need to catch them during the deed.How?
4330,Alys,Qyburn,"The ears outside her door hear singing, laughter, gossip,  nothing of any use.Margaery is too shrewd to be caught so easily,Her women are her  castle walls."
4331,Alys,Taena,"Whenever men are about, her septa will be with her, or her cousins.She must rid herself of her hens sometime,"
4332,Alys,Taena,"Unless  her ladies are part of it as well... not all of them, perhaps, but some.The cousins?"
4333,Alys,Taena,"All three are younger than the little queen, and  more innocent.Wantons clad in maidens white."
4334,Margaery,Taena,Their names will  live in shame.
4335,Margaery,Taena,"Taena, your lord husband is my  justiciar.The two of you must sup with me, this very night."
4336,Cersei,Taena,"I shall command the cooks to roast a boar for us.And  of course we must have some music, to help with our digestion."
4337,Cersei,Taena,"Music.Just so.Go and tell your lord husband and make arrangements for the singer,Ser  Osmund, you may remain."
4338,Cersei,Taena,I shall have need of Qyburn too.
4339,Cersei,Petyr,"A great pity about Lord Gyles,I daresay none of us will miss his  coughing, though.No.No, Id think not.We shall have need of a new lord treasurer."
4340,Harys,Taena,"He can do no worse than  Gyles, and at least he does not cough.Ser Harys is the Kings Hand,"
4341,Harys,Orton,It is time that Tommen had a more forceful  Hand.
4342,Orton,Tywin,Forceful.To be sure.
4343,Orton,Tywin,"Who...?You, my lord."
4344,Owen,Tywin,Your grandsire took my own fathers place as Hand to  Aerys.
4345,Harys,Orton,I have no doubt  that you are more able than Ser Harys.
4346,Harys,Orton,"Will you consent to serve?I... yes, of course.Your Grace does me great honor."
4347,Harys,Orton,"You have served me ably as justiciar, my lord.And will  continue to do so through these... trying times ahead."
4348,Harys,Orton,"And you must be rewarded as  well, for all the sweet songs you have played for us whilst we ate.The gods have given you a  gift."
4349,Harys,Orton,"Your Grace is kind to say so.Not kind,merely truthful."
4350,Blue,Robert,You have no other name?
4351,Blue,Robert,"As a boy, I was called Wat.A fine name for a plowboy,  less fitting for a singer."
4352,Blue,Robert,"It is easy  to see why you are Lady Margaerys favorite.Her Grace is kind.She says I give her pleasure.Oh, Im certain of it.Might I see your lute?If it please Your Grace."
4353,Cersei,Orton,"Sweet and sad as love.Tell me, Wat... the first  time you took Margaery to bed, was that before she wed my son, or after?"
4354,Cersei,Orton,Your Grace  has been misinformed.  
4355,Blue,Orton,"Lord Orton, summon my guards and take this creature to the dungeons."
4356,Blue,Orton,"This... oh, infamy... he dared seduce the  queen?I fear it was the other way around, but he is a traitor all the same.Let him sing for Lord  Qyburn."
4357,Blue,Cersei,No.
4358,Blue,Cersei,"I  never...Mother have mercy, no.I am not your mother,"
4359,Cersei,Qyburn,Is it possible we have the wrong  singer?
4360,Cersei,Qyburn,"All things are possible, Your Grace."
4361,Cersei,Qyburn,The man will confess before the night is  done.
4362,Daenerys,Reznak,I am sorry if the guards were rough with you.
4363,Blue,Qyburn,"All we want from you is the truth.Ive told you the truth,"
4364,Blue,Qyburn,We know better.
4365,Blue,Cersei,"Tell us how you pleasured the little  queen,I never..."
4366,Cersei,Qyburn,Her cousins.How many of them did you have carnal knowledge of?None of them.
4367,Blue,Qyburn,"Please.Your Grace, mayhaps this poor man only played for Margaery whilst she  entertained other lovers.No."
4368,Daenerys,Reznak,  Lord Qyburn ran a hand up the Blue Bards chest.
4369,Blue,Cersei,Some men  enjoy that.Their nipples are as sensitive as a womans.
4370,Cersei,Qyburn,Favor?
4371,Cersei,Qyburn,Is that what women call it now?
4372,Cersei,Margaery,The true one stands before you.
4373,Lambert,Tallad,Who were they?
4374,Euron,Qyburn,All you are doing is spitting up the names of men you saw about her  chambers.We want the truth!The truth.
4375,Loras,Qyburn,"I might have...misremembered.Horas and Hobber had no part of this, did they?No,Not them.As for Ser Loras, I am certain Margaery took pains to hide what she was doing from her  brother.She did."
4376,Loras,Tallad,"He must never know, she said.I prefer this song to the other."
4377,Margaery,Osney,I know you feel better for having told the truth.
4378,Cersei,Margaery,  
4379,Cersei,Qyburn,  You have my word on that.
4380,Cersei,Qyburn,"See that his wounds are cleaned and dressed, and give him milk of the poppy for the pain.Your Grace is good."
4381,Cersei,Qyburn,"Margaery may  wonder where her bard has gone.Singers come and go, they are infamous for it."
4382,Dorcas,Taena,Was it terrible?
4383,Dorcas,Taena,"You cannot know.I need to sleep, but fear to dream."
4384,Cersei,Taena,It was all for Tommen.It was.I know it was.
4385,Cersei,Taena,My throat is raw.Be a sweet and pour me some  wine.If it please you.That is all that I desire.
4386,Dorcas,Jocelyn,"I feel soiled,A bath will set you right, my sweet."
4387,Cersei,Taena,"Tommen  must be spared the worst of this,Margaery still takes him to the   sept every day, so they can ask the gods to heal her brother."
4388,Loras,Taena,"He is fond of her cousins as well.It will go hard on him, to lose them all.All three may not be guilty,Why, it might well be that one  of them took no part.  Yes, very good, but which one is  the innocent?Alla.The shy one?So she seems, but there is more of sly than shy in her.Leave her to me, my sweet.Gladly."
4389,Jalabhar,Taena,"Ser Osney shall confess  as well.The others must be made to understand that only through confession can they earn the  kings forgiveness, and the Wall."
4390,Qyburn,Taena,"Stay with me,I do not  want to sleep alone."
4391,Cersei,Tyrion,"Please,please, not my children, do not harm my children."
4392,Taena,Tyrion,"You shall see them crowned,and you shall see them die."
4393,Melara,Taena,"A bad dream,Did I scream?Im  sorry.Dreams turn to dust in light of day."
4394,Melara,Taena,"Why does he frighten you so, this  silly little man?He is going to kill me."
4395,Melara,Taena,  
4396,Melara,Taena,"Tyrion is the valonqar,Do you  use that word in Myr?Its High Valyrian, it means little brother."
4397,Melara,Taena,"This was a hateful woman, old and sick and ugly."
4398,Cersei,Taena,"This creature dared not strike you,  because of who you were, so she sought to wound you with her vipers tongue."
4399,Cersei,Taena,"Melara died, though, just as she foretold."
4400,Cersei,Tommen,"And Joffrey... the dwarf killed my son before my eyes.One son,but you have another, sweet and strong, and no harm will  ever come to him.Never, whilst I live."
4401,Cersei,Tommen,I will break my fast with the king this morning.I want to see my son.
4402,Cersei,Tommen,"Ser Pounce caught a mouse,but Lady Whiskers stole it from  him."
4403,Cersei,Loras,"Ser Pounce must learn to defend his  rights,In this world the weak are always the victims of the strong."
4404,Joffrey,Loras,"When Ser Loras comes back Im going  to learn to fight with lance and sword and morningstar, the same way he does.You will learn to fight,but not from Ser Loras."
4405,Joffrey,Loras,Elinor says that this is Ser Lorass hardest battle.
4406,Cersei,Joffrey,"Will you  be spending the afternoon with your wife and her cousins?Not today.She has to fast and purify herself, she said."
4407,Daenerys,Reznak,Mother?
4408,Cersei,Osney,"You said something very wise, sweetling.Now run along and  play with your kittens."
4409,Cersei,Osney,"Rise, ser, and sit here next to me.You did me a valiant service once, but now I have a harder  task for you.Aye, and I have something hard for you.That must wait."
4410,Cersei,Osney,Do you recall the  whore who gave these to you?
4411,Baelor,Osney,Would  you like that?Its you I want.
4412,Baelor,Osney,First you must confess your treason.
4413,Baelor,Osney,It is past time  that you rid yourself of your shame.Shame?
4414,Baelor,Osney,"I told Osmund, Margaery just teases.   Cersei broke in, "
4415,Baelor,Osney,Tell him how you bedded Margaery and her cousins.
4416,Baelor,Osney,"What, the cousins too?Megga and Elinor,never Alla."
4417,Baelor,Osney,"Alla would sit weeping, and plead with the others to stop their sinning.Just Megga and Elinor?Or Margaery too?Margaery, most certainly.She was the one behind it all."
4418,Baelor,Osney,"After you cut her head off, I want to take that kiss she never  gave me.You may take all the kisses you like.And then the Wall?For just a little while.Tommen is a forgiving king."
4419,Osney,Tommen,"Usually if I lie about some woman, its me saying how I  never fucked them and them saying how I did."
4420,Osney,Tommen,One o the bad ones.
4421,Osney,Tommen,Are you  refusing to obey me?No.
4422,Osney,Tommen,"The thing is, the best lies have some truth in em... to  give em flavor, as it were."
4423,Cersei,Robert,"I would not want it said I made a liar of you,Give me an hour, and meet me in my bedchamber.We waited long enough."
4424,Arianne,Cersei,"Take off the rest before I tear that too,You can keep the crown on.I  like you in the crown."
4425,Arianne,Hot,"Areo,I never wanted the girl to come to harm."
4426,Arianne,Hot,"You know me, captain,You have known me  since I was little."
4427,Areo,Hot,   Areo Hotah said.
4428,Arianne,Hot,"I am sorry.It is for my prince to command, for Hotah to obey."
4429,Arianne,Hot,"Princess,"
4430,Arianne,Garin,"Ser Manfrey shall escort you there, to  await the princes pleasure.The princes displeasure, you mean.Will my friends be confined here as well?"
4431,Garin,Hot,"That is for the prince to decide,"
4432,Arianne,Hot,"They were taken to the Planky Town  and will be conveyed by ship to Ghaston Grey, until such time as Prince Doran decides their  fate."
4433,Arianne,Hot,Does my father mean to  kill them?
4434,Arianne,Hot,"All they did they did for love for me.If my father must  have blood, it should be mine.As you say, princess.I want to speak with him.He thought you might."
4435,Arianne,Hot,"Someone told,"
4436,Arianne,Myrcella,When might I see my father?
4437,Arianne,Myrcella,"I am not hungry,"
4438,Arianne,Chett,Take this away and bring me Prince Doran.
4439,Arianne,Myrcella,Has Darkstar been captured?
4440,Arianne,Myrcella,Are they still hunting for him?
4441,Arianne,Myrcella,Have  you gone deaf?
4442,Arianne,Myrcella,Come back here and answer me.I command it.
4443,Arianne,Myrcella,"Timoth,what has become of Princess Myrcella?"
4444,Doran,Myrcella,"Tell me that she has  not died, I beg you."
4445,Doran,Myrcella,Tell me how she fares.
4446,Doran,Myrcella,"Belandra,"
4447,Arianne,Doran,Please.
4448,Ellaria,Obara,Tyene!
4449,Ellaria,Obara,"Tyene, are you there?"
4450,Ellaria,Obara,TYENE?
4451,Arianne,Ellaria,"I will speak with my  father now,You will take me to him."
4452,Arianne,Chett,"I am ready to see the prince,"
4453,Garin,Oberyn,"I know you have been commanded not to speak to me,but no one told me not to  speak to you."
4454,Arianne,Garin,"Hes the one I  fear for most,The orphans are free spirits, they live to wander."
4455,Arianne,Garin,He will not last a year at Ghaston Grey.
4456,Arianne,Garin,"Please,You have to help him.Please  dont let him die.I can do little and less so long as I am locked up here,My father will  not see me."
4457,Arianne,Garin,"Do you love him?Yes,But how can I help?You can smuggle out a letter for me,Will do you that?Will you take the  risk... for Garin?"
4458,Arianne,Doran,"Give the man who brings this to  you a hundred silver stags,"
4459,Arianne,Doran,"Whoever shall deliver me from this cell, he shall  not be forgotten when I wed."
4460,Arianne,Doran,"I want a consort with teeth,"
4461,Arianne,Chett,"Theres a place beside the Threefold Gate where the caravans take  on supplies before crossing the deep sand,Find some traveler headed for the  Princes Pass, and promise him a hundred silver stags if he will put this in Lord Fowlers hand.I will."
4462,Arianne,Chett,"Ill find someone before the sun goes down,  princess.Good,Tell me how it went on the morrow."
4463,Arianne,Doran,Has Cedra taken ill?
4464,Arianne,Doran,Did you tell Ricasso what I said?
4465,Arianne,Doran,Did you tell him I had need of him?
4466,Arianne,Oberyn,"If you would wed, wed,If not, take your pleasure where you find it."
4467,Doran,Oberyn,I gave you the tools to do that for yourself.
4468,Areo,Hot,"Little princess,Up and dress.The prince has called for you."
4469,Arianne,Hot,"What did you do with Cedra?The prince sent her to the Water Gardens,He will tell you.First you must wash,  and eat."
4470,Arianne,Hot,"Have  Morra and Mellei prepare a bath,"
4471,Arianne,Hot,"Some cold broth and a bit of bread and fruit.Aye,"
4472,Areo,Arianne,"Father,"
4473,Areo,Arianne,"A strange and subtle folk, the Volantenes,I saw Volantis once, on my way to Norvos, where I first met Mellario."
4474,Areo,Hot,"Areo will recall the day.I remember,The bears danced and the bells rang, and  the prince wore red and gold and orange.My lady asked me who it was who shone so bright."
4475,Doran,Hot,"Leave us, captain."
4476,Doran,Hot,"I told them to place a cyvasse table in your chambers,Who was I supposed to play with?"
4477,Doran,Hot,Yourself.
4478,Arianne,Hot,"How well do you  know the game, Arianne?Well enough to play.But not to win."
4479,Arianne,Hot,Cyvasse is not for me.
4480,Arianne,Hot,Tell me why.For the honor of our House.
4481,Arianne,Chett,"Your  meekness shames all Dorne, Father.Your brother went to Kings Landing in your place, and they  killed him!Do you think I do not know that?Oberyn is with me every time I close my eyes.Telling you to open them, no doubt."
4482,Arianne,Chett,I did not give you leave to sit.Then call Hotah back and whip me for my insolence.
4483,Arianne,Chett,You can do  that.
4484,Arianne,Chett,Have you caught Ser Gerold?
4485,Arianne,Chett,Would that we had.
4486,Arianne,Caleotte,You and he have done us all great harm.
4487,Arianne,Caleotte,Myrcella.
4488,Arianne,Caleotte,?... dead?
4489,Arianne,Myrcella,"You have dishonored all of us.I never meant her harm,If Hotah had not interfered...... you would have crowned Myrcella queen, to raise a rebellion against her brother."
4490,Arianne,Doran,Are you proud?
4491,Arianne,Doran,"What am I to do with you, Arianne?"
4492,Arianne,Doran,"Why, do what you  always do.Do nothing.You make it difficult for a man to swallow his anger.Best stop swallowing, youre like to choke on it."
4493,Arianne,Doran,Tell me how  you knew my plans.I am the Prince of Dorne.Men seek my favor.
4494,Arianne,Doran,"You knew, and yet you still allowed us to make off with Myrcella.Why?That was my mistake, and it has proved a grievous one."
4495,Arianne,Doran,"I had to learn the truth.Now you have.I want to know who informed on me.I would as well, in your place.Will you tell me?I can think of no reason why I should.You think I cannot discover the truth on my own?You are welcome to try.Until such time you must mistrust them all... and a little mistrust is a  good thing in a princess."
4496,Arianne,Doran,"You disappoint me, Arianne.Said the crow to the raven.You have been disappointing me for years, Father."
4497,Arianne,Doran,I know.
4498,Andrey,Doran,"You ought to be pleading for my  forgiveness rather than seeking to provoke me further.I ask leniency only for my friends.How noble of you.What they did they did for love for me.They do not deserve to die on Ghaston Grey.As it happens, I agree."
4499,Andrey,Garin,"I might have had their heads off.You might have, but you didnt.Dayne, Dalt, Santagar... no, you would never dare make  enemies of such Houses.I dare more than you dream... but leave that for the nonce."
4500,Garin,Sylva,"A knight of the  Kingsguard... what did you do to him?I fucked him, Father.You did command me to entertain our noble visitors, as I recall."
4501,Garin,Sylva,"Was that all that was required?I told him that once Myrcella was the queen she would give us leave to marry.He wanted me  for his wife.You did everything you could to stop him from dishonoring his vows, I am certain,"
4502,Areo,Hot,"We  should not be doing this,"
4503,Arianne,Hot,"He did love me,He died for me.If so, he may well be but the first of many."
4504,Arianne,Myrcella,"Perhaps Arys went swimming at the Water  Gardens, slipped upon the marble, hit his head, and drowned?No,Say that he died defending his little princess.Tell Ser Balon that Darkstar  tried to kill her and Ser Arys stepped between them and saved her life."
4505,Arianne,Myrcella,"Ser Balon may be suspicious, as you were when the Lannisters killed your  sister and her children, but he will have no proof..."
4506,Arianne,Myrcella,No lie will save Dorne from the queens wroth if her daughter should perish  whilst in my care.
4507,Arianne,Tywin,"I could tell Myrcella what to say, but why should I?"
4508,Arianne,Tywin,"I warn you, Arianne, I am out of patience.With me?"
4509,Elia,Tywin,"For Lord Tywin and the Lannisters you always had the  forbearance of Baelor the Blessed, but for your own blood, none.You mistake patience for forbearance."
4510,Elia,Tywin,"Lord Tywin is howling down in hell... where thousands more  will soon be joining him, if your folly turns to war."
4511,Arianne,Elia,Is that what you want?
4512,Arianne,Quentyn,I want my cousins freed.
4513,Arianne,Quentyn,"I want  my rights.Your rights?Dorne.You will have Dorne after I am dead.Are you so anxious to be rid of me?I should turn that question back on you, Father.You have been trying to rid yourself of me for  years.That is not true.No?Shall we ask my brother?Trystane?Quentyn.What of him?Where is he?He is with Lord Yronwoods host in the Boneway.You do lie well, Father, I will grant you that."
4514,Arianne,Quentyn,Quentyn has gone  to Lys.Where did you get that notion?A friend told me.
4515,Arianne,Quentyn,Your friend lied.
4516,Arianne,Quentyn,I swear it by sun and  spear and Seven.
4517,Arianne,Quentyn,"Is it Myr, then?"
4518,Arianne,Quentyn,"I know he is somewhere across  the narrow sea, hiring sellswords to steal away my birthright."
4519,Arianne,Quentyn,"This mistrust does you no honor, Arianne."
4520,Arianne,Quentyn,"Anders Yronwood has been more a father to him than I have, yet your  brother remains faithful and obedient.Why not?"
4521,Doran,Quentyn,I read your letter.
4522,Doran,Quentyn,"One day you will sit where I sit and rule all Dorne, you wrote  him."
4523,Doran,Quentyn,What did I ever do to make you hate me so?
4524,Doran,Quentyn,I never hated you.
4525,Doran,Quentyn,"Arianne, you  do not understand.Do you deny you wrote those words?No."
4526,Gyles,Quentyn,"I  had other plans for you.Oh, yes,"
4527,Gyles,Quentyn,They were your plans.
4528,Gyles,Quentyn,"I know it is my duty to provide an heir for Dorne, I have  never been forgetful of that."
4529,Arianne,Gyles,"If you ever felt any love for me at all, why offer  me to Walder Frey?Because I knew that you would spurn him."
4530,Arianne,Garin,"You were promised, Arianne."
4531,Arianne,Garin,What are you saying?
4532,Arianne,Garin,    
4533,Doran,Obara,I could not take the risk.
4534,Doran,Obara,"Who is it?Who have I been betrothed  to, all these years?It makes no matter.He is dead."
4535,Arianne,Doran,"The old ones are so frail.Was it a broken hip, a chill, the  gout?It was a pot of molten gold.We princes make our careful plans and the gods smash them all  awry."
4536,Arianne,Doran,Dorne will be yours.
4537,Arianne,Doran,Your brother Quentyn has a  harder road to walk.What road?
4538,Arianne,Doran,What are you holding back?
4539,Arianne,Doran,"Tell me the rest, Father... or else name Quentyn your heir and send for  Hotah and his axe, and let me die beside my cousins.Do you truly believe I would harm my brothers children?"
4540,Arianne,Garin,"Obara,  Nym, and Tyene lack for nothing but their freedom, and Ellaria and her daughters are happily  ensconced at the Water Gardens.Dorea stalks about knocking oranges off the trees with her  morningstar, and Elia and Obella have become the terror of the pools."
4541,Arianne,Garin,It has not  been so long since you were playing in those pools.  
4542,Arianne,Garin,"Oh, and Frynne, her father was a smith."
4543,Arianne,Garin,"When I rode Garin no one could defeat us, not even Nym and that green-haired Tyroshi girl.That green-haired girl was the Archons daughter."
4544,Cletus,Garin,I could not  do that to her.
4545,Cletus,Garin,"Is that where Quentyns gone?To Tyrosh, to court the Archons  green-haired daughter?"
4546,Cletus,Doran,I must know how you learned that Quentyn was abroad.
4547,Cletus,Doran,He has gone  to bring us back our hearts desire.
4548,Cletus,Doran,What is our hearts desire?Vengeance.
4549,Doran,Gretchel,Justice.Fire and blood.
4550,Gretchel,Maddy,Sweetrobin?
4551,Gretchel,Maddy,"May I enter?Have a care, mlady,His lordship threw his  chamber pot at the maester.Then he has none to throw at me."
4552,Gretchel,Maddy,"Have all the furnishings been covered?All of them, mlady,Best make certain of it."
4553,Gretchel,Maddy,"Its only me,  Sweetrobin."
4554,Gretchel,Maddy,"Are you alone?I am, my lord.Come close, then.Just you."
4555,Gretchel,Maddy,Did Maester Colemon send you?
4556,Gretchel,Maddy,"No,I heard my Sweetrobin was ailing."
4557,Lothor,Robert,"If mlady can talk him  out of bed nice,I wont have to drag him out."
4558,Lothor,Robert,"Are you hungry, my lord?"
4559,Lothor,Robert,"Shall I send Maddy down for  berries and cream, or some warm bread and butter?"
4560,Lothor,Robert,"I dont want food,Im going to stay in bed  today.You could read to me if you want.It is too dark in here for reading."
4561,Chett,Robert,"Has my Sweetrobin forgotten what day this is?No,"
4562,Chett,Robert,You could read to me about the  Winged Knight.
4563,Chett,Robert,"Sweetling, we  have to go,but I promise, Ill read you two tales of the Winged Knight when  we reach the Gates of the Moon.Three,"
4564,Chett,Robert,"Three,Might I let some sun in?No."
4565,Chett,Robert,"Come to bed, Alayne."
4566,Chett,Robert,I shant open them very wide.Only enough to see my Sweetrobins face.
4567,Chett,Robert,If you must.
4568,Maddy,Robert,"You look very strong this morning, my lord."
4569,Maddy,Robert,Shall I have Maddy and Gretchel fetch hot water for  your bath?
4570,Maddy,Mya,Wont that be nice?No.
4571,Maddy,Mya,"My mommy  never hurt me scrubbing.I will tell Maddy not to scrub my Sweetrobin so hard.Youll feel better when youre fresh and  clean.No bath, I told you, my head hurts most awfully.Shall I bring you a warm cloth for your brow?"
4572,Mya,Robert,You  know how much she loves you.I dont love her.Shes just the mule girl.
4573,Mya,Robert,"Maester Colemon put something  vile in my milk last night, I could taste it."
4574,Mya,Robert,"No one does  what I say.Ill speak to him,"
4575,Daenerys,Reznak,  His mouth quivered.
4576,Moon,Mya,You tell that Mya  that Im staying here.
4577,Moon,Mya,"No one can hurt me so long as I  stay here.The Eyrie is impregnable.Who would want to hurt my Sweetrobin?Your lords and knights adore you, and the smallfolk  cheer your name."
4578,Lothor,Robert,"Sweetrobin,"
4579,Lothor,Mya,"Her mules have gone up and down this old mountain a thousand times.I hate mules,Mules are nasty.I told you, one tried to bite me when I was little."
4580,Gretchel,Robert,"Mya will keep the mules from biting,"
4581,Gretchel,Robert,"If I can do it, I know you  can, Sweetrobin.I could do it,but I dont choose to."
4582,Gretchel,Robert,Tell Mya I am going to stay abed.
4583,Gretchel,Robert,"Well sleep and kiss and play games, and  you can read me about the Winged Knight.I will.Three tales, as I promised... when we reach the Gates of the Moon."
4584,Gretchel,Robert,"Lord Nestor has prepared a feast to welcome you, mushroom  soup and venison and cakes.You dont want to disappoint him, do you?Will they be lemon cakes?"
4585,Lysa,Robert,"Lemony lemony lemon cakes,and you can have as many as you like.A hundred?"
4586,Lysa,Robert,Could I have a hundred?If it please you.
4587,Petyr,Robert,"Now, will you get out of bed and let us dress you?I want a hundred lemon cakes and five tales!"
4588,Petyr,Robert,As my lord desires.
4589,Petyr,Robert,"Come, before  the mornings gone."
4590,Gretchel,Maddy,"Thats enough.You can kiss me again when we reach the  Gates, if you keep your word."
4591,Gyles,Terrance,"Lord Robert is feeling stronger,Fetch hot water for his  bath, but see you dont scald him.And do not pull on his hair when you brush out the tangles, he  hates that.Terrance, lay out his lordships riding  clothes and his warmest cloak."
4592,Colemon,Gyles,"Im no scrubwoman.Do as Lady Alayne commands, or Lothor Brune will hear of it,"
4593,Colemon,Gyles,"I am grateful for your intercession,  my lady.You have a way with him."
4594,Colemon,Gyles,"Did you observe any shaking while you were  with him?His fingers trembled a little bit when I held his hand, thats all.He says you put something vile  in his milk.Vile?"
4595,Colemon,Robert,I merely... is  he bleeding from the nose?No.Good.That is good.
4596,Colemon,Robert,"This descent... my lady, it might be safest if I mixed his lordship some milk of  the poppy.Mya Stone could lash him over the back of her most surefooted mule whilst he  slumbered.The Lord of the Eyrie cannot descend from his mountain tied up like a sack of barleycorn."
4597,Colemon,Petyr,"Give his lordship a cup of sweetmilk,That will stop him from shaking on the journey down.He had a cup not three days past,And wanted another last night, which you refused him.It was too soon."
4598,Colemon,Nestor,"  If my father  were here, I know he would tell you to keep Lord Robert calm at all costs.I try, my lady, yet his fits grow ever more violent, and his blood is so thin I dare not leech him  any more.Sweetsleep... you are certain he was not bleeding from the nose?He was sniffling,but I saw no blood.I must speak to the Lord Protector.This feast... is that wise, I wonder, after the strain of the  descent?It will not be a large feast,No more than forty guests.  Music frightens him.Music soothes him,the high harp especially."
4599,Colemon,Sansa,"Lord Nestor will have no singers at the feast, only flutes and fiddles for the dancing."
4600,Colemon,Sansa,"Just give him a cup of the  sweetmilk before we go, and another at the feast, and there should be no trouble.Very well."
4601,Colemon,Sansa,"But this must be the last.For half a year, or  longer.You had best take that up with the Lord Protector."
4602,Petyr,Robert,"All  men live with fear,"
4603,Lothor,Lysa,Boy out of bed?
4604,Lothor,Lysa,Theyre bathing him.He will be ready within the hour.We best hope he is.Mya wont wait past midday.
4605,Lothor,Lysa,"Shell wait,She has to wait.Dont be so certain, mlady."
4606,Lothor,Mya,I think shed leave us all to  starve before shed put those animals at risk.
4607,Lothor,Mya,"Innocence and experience make for a perfect  marriage,"
4608,Lothor,Petyr,"I went to them when my father died,but they shat on  me, and said I was no blood of theirs."
4609,Gretchel,Mya,"Mlady,"
4610,Gretchel,Mya,Lady Myrandas with  her.Oh.
4611,Myranda,Petyr,"Soon or late you must meet  Myranda Royce,When you do, be careful."
4612,Myranda,Petyr,Guard your tongue around her.
4613,Myranda,Petyr,Robert will be pleased.
4614,Myranda,Petyr,"You must excuse me, ser.I need to finish packing."
4615,Mya,Renly,Where is he?
4616,Mya,Renly,His lordship is being bathed and dressed.He needs to make some haste.
4617,Mya,Renly,We need to get below  Snow before the sun goes down.How bad is the wind?
4618,Mya,Renly,"It could be worse... and will be, after dark."
4619,Mya,Robert,"If he  bathes much longer, well be trapped up here all winter with nothing to eat except each other."
4620,Gyles,Terrance,"My lord,will you ride down with me?"
4621,Mya,Robert,"I want Alayne,Ill only go with her.The bucket can hold all three of us.I just want Alayne.You smell all stinky, like a mule.As you wish."
4622,Lothor,Robert,AWAY!
4623,Chett,Robert,"My lord is brave,Im so frightened I can hardly  talk, but not you."
4624,Chett,Robert,"The Winged Knight was brave, and so am I,Im  an Arryn.Will my Sweetrobin hold me tight?"
4625,Chett,Robert,"If you like,"
4626,Myranda,Robert,"My lord,youve grown so  big!Have I?"
4627,Myranda,Robert,"You will be taller than me soon,"
4628,Robert,Sansa,"And you must be the Lord Protectors daughter,I had heard that you were beautiful.I see that it is true."
4629,Robert,Sansa,My lady is kind to say so.Kind?
4630,Robert,Sansa,How boring that would be.
4631,Myranda,Sansa,"May I call you Alayne?If you wish, my lady."
4632,Myranda,Sansa,"I am my lady at the Gates, but up here on the mountain you may call me Randa.How many  years have you, Alayne?Four-and-ten, my lady."
4633,Myranda,Sansa,Randa.
4634,Myranda,Sansa,"Are you still  innocent, Alayne?"
4635,Myranda,Sansa,"You should not... yes, of course.Saving yourself for Lord Robert?"
4636,Colemon,Myranda,"Or is there some ardent squire  dreaming of your favors?No,Shes my friend."
4637,Gretchel,Mya,"We dont want to get bunched up on the mountain,Ill take  Lord Robert and his companions."
4638,Lothor,Robert,"Carrot, youll have charge of their chests and boxes."
4639,Lothor,Robert,"Which mule will you ride today, my lord?Theyre all stinky."
4640,Mya,Robert,And Myranda too.Where the way is wide enough.
4641,Mya,Robert,Theres a smell of  snow in the air.
4642,Daenerys,Reznak,Its too cold. said Mya.
4643,Mya,Sansa,"Look up, not down,"
4644,Myranda,Sansa,"We have had a letter from your father,He is on his way   home, he says, and hopes to see his darling daughter soon."
4645,Petyr,Symond,"Lady Waynwood turned up with the Knight of Ninestars for the  wedding feast, Lord Petyr says, to everyones astonishment.Anya Waynwood?Truly?"
4646,Symon,Symond,Was there more?
4647,Mya,Myranda,"Not from your father, no, but weve had other birds."
4648,Mya,Myranda,"Riverrun has yielded, but Dragonstone and Storms End still hold for Lord Stannis.Lady Lysa was so wise, to keep us out of it."
4649,Mya,Myranda,"Yes, she was the very soul of wisdom, that good  lady."
4650,Mya,Myranda,Why must mules be so bony and ill-tempered?
4651,Jon,Mya,"Oh, and the Nights Watch has a boy commander, some bastard son of Eddard  Starks.Jon Snow?"
4652,Jon,Robb,"Snow?Yes, it would be Snow, I suppose."
4653,Harrold,Harry,"Our cousin Bronze Yohn had himself a mêlée at Runestone,a small one, just for squires."
4654,Harrold,Harry,Bronze Yohn knighted him.Oh.
4655,Harry,Myranda,I pray he proves a worthy knight.
4656,Harry,Myranda,I pray he gets the pox.
4657,Harry,Tyrion,"I do not know whether it was me she found unsuitable, or just my dowry."
4658,Harry,Tyrion,"I do need another husband.I had one once, but I killed him.You did?"
4659,Harry,Tyrion,"Oh, yes."
4660,Harry,Tyrion,"You do know what goes on in a  marriage bed, I hope?"
4661,Harry,Tyrion,"That must  have been dreadful, my lady."
4662,Harry,Tyrion,  
4663,Harry,Tyrion,"It was disconcerting, certainly."
4664,Harry,Petyr,"Lady Waynwood will most like marry him to one of her granddaughters, or one of Bronze  Yohns.As you say, my lady."
4665,Harry,Petyr,Randa.
4666,Marillion,Petyr,Da.Randa.Much better.
4667,Lysa,Moon,"I do not bed monsters, as a rule."
4668,Lysa,Moon,"You are prettier than me, but my breasts are larger."
4669,Maddy,Myranda,"Yours are ample for a girl your age, but as they are  bastard breasts, I shant concern myself with them."
4670,Maddy,Myranda,"You know  our Myas not a maid, I trust?"
4671,Maddy,Mya,Maddy told me.Of course she did.
4672,Mya,Yohn,"Lord Horton gave him no choice in the matter, I am sure, but it was  still a cruel thing to do to Mya.Ser Lothor is fond of her."
4673,Myranda,Yohn,More  than fond.Lothor Brune?
4674,Mya,Myranda,Does she know?
4675,Mya,Myranda,"He has no hope, poor man."
4676,Jeyne,Mya,"She is half mule, that one."
4677,Jeyne,Myranda,"Do you think Ser Lothor likes her as she is, in mail and  leather?"
4678,Jeyne,Myranda,Or does he dream of her draped  in silks and velvets?Hes a man.He dreams of her naked.
4679,Jeyne,Myranda,You do turn such a pretty shade of pink.
4680,Lysa,Myranda,"I have not blushed for years, though."
4681,Lysa,Myranda,Does  your father plan to wed again?My father?
4682,Lysa,Moon,"We all know how devoted he was to Lady Lysa,"
4683,Myranda,Petyr,"How little is it, do you know?His finger?"
4684,Myranda,Petyr,I dont...  Lady Myranda laughed so loud that Mya Stone glanced back at them.
4685,Mya,Robert,"It is wider than it looks,A yard across, and no more than eight yards long, thats nothing.Nothing,"
4686,Mya,Robert,"Its best to lead the mules across,If it please my lord, Ill take mine over first,  then come back for yours."
4687,Mya,Robert,"I shant be long, my lord,"
4688,Mya,Robert,"Sweetrobin,"
4689,Myranda,Robert,I know youre not afraid.
4690,Myranda,Robert,"Im not?Not you.Youre my winged knight, Ser Sweetrobin.The Winged Knight could fly,Higher than the mountains."
4691,Myranda,Robert,"He could,Ser Sweetrobin,"
4692,Mya,Robert,"Be careful,He can hurt you, flailing.You wouldnt think so, but he can."
4693,Mya,Myranda,"So youre brave as well as beautiful,No."
4694,Mya,Myranda,Im not.
4695,Mya,Myranda,I dont think I could have  crossed without Lord Robert.
4696,Mya,Myranda,You almost fell.Youre mistaken.I never fall.
4697,Mya,Myranda,"Almost, I said."
4698,Mya,Myranda,Werent you afraid?
4699,Mya,Myranda,I remember a man throwing me in the air when I was very little.
4700,Mya,Myranda,I  knew that he would always be there to catch me.
4701,Mya,Myranda,Then one day he  wasnt.
4702,Mya,Myranda,I wont fall.
4703,Mya,Myranda,"Best finish.We have a long way yet to go,  and I can smell a storm."
4704,Mya,Myranda,"The snow might be five feet deep by then,  and the steps treacherous even for my mules,We will do better to press on.Well  take it slow."
4705,Moon,Myranda,"We have apartments prepared for all of you,but if you like you may  share my bed tonight."
4706,Moon,Myranda,"Usually when ladies share my bed they have to pay a pillow tax and tell me all about the wicked  things theyve done.What if they havent done any wicked things?Why, then they must confess all the wicked things they want to do."
4707,Moon,Myranda,I can  see how virtuous you are just by looking at those rosy cheeks and big blue eyes of yours.
4708,Chett,Myranda,I hope your feet are warm.I do hate bedmaids with cold feet.
4709,Chett,Petyr,"Lady Alayne,the Lord Protector has been waiting for you.Hes back?"
4710,Chett,Petyr,At evenfall.Youll find him in the west tower.
4711,Chett,Petyr,"Alayne.Come,  give your father a kiss."
4712,Chett,Petyr,"I am sorry to intrude, Father.No one  told me you had company.You are never an intrusion, sweetling.I was just now telling these good knights what a dutiful  daughter I had.Dutiful and beautiful,Aye,You left out that part, mlord.I would do the same if she were my daughter,Particularly around louts like us."
4713,Petyr,Shadrich,Are you louts?
4714,Petyr,Shadrich,"Why, I took the three of you for gallant  knights.Knights they are,Their gallantry has yet to be demonstrated, but we may hope."
4715,Petyr,Shadrich,"Sers, the Lady Alayne, my  natural and very clever daughter... with whom I must needs confer, if you will be so good as to  excuse us."
4716,Petyr,Shadrich,Hedge knights?
4717,Petyr,Shadrich,Hungry knights.
4718,Cersei,Petyr,"The Merling Kings returned to Gulltown, and old Oswell had some tales to tell."
4719,Cersei,Petyr,"I did not expect you back so soon,I am glad youve come.I would never have known it from the kiss you gave me."
4720,Cersei,Petyr,"Now thats the sort of kiss that  says welcome home.See that you do better next time.Yes, Father."
4721,Cersei,Petyr,"You would not believe half of what is happening in  Kings Landing, sweetling."
4722,Cersei,Petyr,"What little peace and order the five kings left us  will not long survive the three queens, I fear.Three queens?"
4723,Chett,Petyr,I have brought my sweet girl  back a gift.
4724,Chett,Petyr,Is it a gown?
4725,Chett,Petyr,Something better.Guess again.Jewels?No jewels could hope to match my daughters eyes.Lemons?Did you find some lemons?
4726,Cersei,Petyr,I have made a marriage  contract for you.A marriage...
4727,Cersei,Petyr,I do not...
4728,Daenerys,Reznak," Alayne looked to the door, to make certain it was closed. she whispered."
4729,Cersei,Petyr,"The dwarf wed Eddard Starks daughter, not mine."
4730,Cersei,Sansa,"Lady Waynwood  will not make him marry against his will, she was quite firm on that.Lady Waynwood?"
4731,Cersei,Sansa,Why would she marry one of her sons  to... to a...
4732,Myranda,Yohn,"You are promised to Harrold Hardyng, sweetling, provided you can win his  boyish heart... which should not be hard, for you.Harry the Heir?"
4733,Harry,Myranda,He was just knighted.And he has a bastard daughter by some common girl.And another on the way by a different wench.
4734,Harry,Petyr,"And very gallant, I am told."
4735,Harry,Petyr,"Bastard-born or no, sweetling, when this match is announced you will be the  envy of every highborn maiden in the Vale, and a few from the riverlands and the Reach as  well.Why?"
4736,Harry,Petyr,"Is Ser Harrold... how could he be Lady Waynwoods heir?Doesnt  she have sons of her own blood?Three,"
4737,Jon,Petyr,"Daughters too, and grandsons.Wont they come before Harry?I dont understand.You will.Listen."
4738,Jon,Petyr,"Lord Jasper Arryn, begin with him."
4739,Jon,Petyr,"His sister Alys wed Ser Elys Waynwood, uncle to the present Lady Waynwood."
4740,Jon,Petyr,"Elys and Alys, isnt that precious?"
4741,Alys,Jon,"Are you  paying close attention, sweetling?Yes.There was Jon and Alys and Ronnel, but Ronnel died.Good."
4742,Aerys,Denys,You know that story?
4743,Aerys,Denys,The Mad King murdered him.He did indeed.
4744,Jon,Lysa,Which brings us back to the five remaining daughters of Elys and Alys.
4745,Petyr,Robert,"That left the  youngest, who wed a landed knight sworn to the Waynwoods, gave him a son that she named  Harrold, and perished."
4746,Petyr,Robert,"So tell me,  sweetling...why is Harry the Heir?"
4747,Petyr,Robert,He is not Lady Waynwoods heir.
4748,Daenerys,Reznak,  Petyr arched an eyebrow.
4749,Harry,Sansa,"Thats worth another kiss now, dont you think?"
4750,Harren,Podrick,Ser?
4751,Harren,Podrick,Ser?
4752,Harren,Podrick,My lady?
4753,Brienne,Renly,"My sword,Oathkeeper.Please."
4754,Biter,Brea,"Jaime,Jaime."
4755,Brea,Brienne,"We have no maester,Only me."
4756,Brienne,Meribald,My lady?
4757,Brienne,Meribald,Lady Sansa?
4758,Brienne,Meribald,She thinks youre Sansa Stark.She cant go much farther.Shell die.One less lion.I wont weep.
4759,Brienne,Renly,Where are we going?
4760,Brienne,Renly,Where are you   taking me?
4761,Brienne,Renly,"Cold,"
4762,Brienne,Chett,"Drink this, mlady,"
4763,Brienne,Chett,"Water,Please.Water.Water wont help the pain."
4764,Brienne,Chett,A little.
4765,Biter,Brienne,No more.More.
4766,Biter,Brienne,"Two, maybe three.Biter,Aye.A real monster, that one."
4767,Brienne,Gendry,Is he dead?
4768,Brienne,Gendry,Biter.Is he dead?
4769,Brienne,Gendry,Hes dead.
4770,Brienne,Gendry,"Drink, mlady, or Ill  pour it down your throat."
4771,Brienne,Gendry,"I am looking for a girl,"
4772,Brienne,Gendry,A highborn maid of three-and-ten.She has blue eyes and auburn hair.Im not her.
4773,Brienne,Willow,Youre the sister.The innkeep.I might be.
4774,Brienne,Willow,What if I am?Do you have a name?
4775,Brienne,Willow,Heddle.
4776,Brienne,Willow,Jeyne Heddle.Jeyne.
4777,Renly,Willow,Im bleeding.Its not allowed.  
4778,Gendry,Renly,Mlady means for you to answer for your crimes.Mlady.
4779,Gendry,Randyll,Stoneheart.Is that who  you mean?
4780,Brienne,Randyll,Lady Stoneheart.Some call her that.
4781,Brienne,Randyll,The  Hangwoman.
4782,Hyle,Podrick,Podrick.
4783,Gendry,Meribald,What did you  do with Dog?
4784,Brienne,Gendry,"It was you killed the dog, mlady,"
4785,Brienne,Jaime,"No,"
4786,Jaime,Renly,"My sword.Please, I have to find my sword.The wench wants her sword back,And I want Cersei Lannister to suck my cock.So what?Jaime called it Oathkeeper.Please."
4787,Brienne,Jeyne,"Beauty,freak, freak."
4788,Brienne,Jeyne,"Stop,Someone make them stop."
4789,Brienne,Jeyne,"Easy,Gendry,I have to talk with Gendry.He turned back at the river, mlady.Hes gone back to his forge, to Willow and the little ones,  to keep them safe."
4790,Brienne,Jeyne,"Ah, let her choke.Save us a rope."
4791,Brienne,Sandor,"No,No, youre dead, I killed you."
4792,Brienne,Sandor,You got that backwards.
4793,Brienne,Sandor,"Id do it now, but mlady  wants to see you hanged."
4794,Brienne,Jeyne,"Bread and salt,The inn... Septon Meribald fed the children...  we broke bread with your sister...Guest right dont mean so much as it used to,Not since mlady come back  from the wedding.Some o them swinging down by the river figured they was guests too.We figured different,They wanted beds.We gave em trees.We got more trees, though,We  always got more trees."
4795,Chett,Jacelyn,"He will bring a rose for you,"
4796,Brienne,Jaime,"Brienne the Beauty,I have seen sows more beautiful than you."
4797,Biter,Brienne,Is anyone there?
4798,Biter,Brienne,Lady Brienne?
4799,Biter,Brienne,I was dreaming.
4800,Biter,Brienne,"What place is this?Is this a dungeon?A cave.Like rats, we must run back to our holes when the dogs come sniffing after us, and  there are more dogs every day."
4801,Chett,Jacelyn,Are you hungry?
4802,Chett,Jacelyn,Perhaps some bread  and honey?I want my clothes.My sword.
4803,Chett,Jacelyn,The way out.Show me the way out.
4804,Chett,Jeyne,"Might I feel your brow, my lady?"
4805,Chett,Jeyne,"Your fever has broken,Well and good."
4806,Brienne,Jeyne,Jeyne feared  that we might lose you.Jeyne.The tall girl?The very one.
4807,Brienne,Jeyne,"That is where the fever came from, I am certain."
4808,Brienne,Jeyne,"We had to cut away some of the flesh.Your face will not be pretty,  I fear."
4809,Biter,Brienne,"Scars, you mean?My lady, that creature chewed off half your cheek."
4810,Biter,Lem,Why set my bones and wash my wounds if you only mean to hang me?Why indeed?
4811,Biter,Lem,"You  fought bravely at the inn, they tell me."
4812,Jeyne,Lem,"Whatever else you  may have done, you won those wounds honorably, in the best of causes."
4813,Jeyne,Lem,What is it that you think Ive done?
4814,Jeyne,Lem,"Who are  you?We were kings men when we began,"
4815,Beric,Brienne,The fires  have not shown me what lies at its end.
4816,Beric,Brienne,"Fires,"
4817,Beric,Brienne,You are the Myrish priest.The red wizard.
4818,Beric,Brienne,"The pink pretender, rather.I am  Thoros, late of Myr, aye... a bad priest and a worse wizard.You ride with the Dondarrion.The lightning lord.Lightning comes and goes and then is seen no more."
4819,Beric,Brienne,A grimmer shadow leads us in his place.Sandor?
4820,Beric,Thoros,"Sandor is dead and buried.I saw him.In the woods.A fever dream, my lady.He said that he would hang me.Even dreams can lie."
4821,Beric,Thoros,Surely you are  famished?
4822,Brienne,Thoros,"Food... food would be welcome, thank you.A meal, then."
4823,Brienne,Thoros,Wait here.
4824,Brienne,Thoros,"I am sorry,The last of the milk  had soured, and the honey is all gone."
4825,Brienne,Thoros,"Still, this will fill you."
4826,Brienne,Thoros,Are my companions here?
4827,Brienne,Thoros,The septon was set free to go upon his way.
4828,Brienne,Thoros,"The others are here,  awaiting judgment.Judgment?"
4829,Brienne,Thoros,Podrick Payne is just a boy.He says he is a squire.You know how boys will boast.The Imps squire.
4830,Brienne,Thoros,"He has even killed, to hear  him tell it.A boy,Have pity.My lady,"
4831,Beric,Thoros,"When men must live like rats in the dark beneath the earth, they soon run out of pity, as  they do of milk and honey.And justice?Can that be found in caves?Justice."
4832,Beric,Thoros,I remember justice.
4833,Beric,Brienne,War makes monsters of us all.Are you saying you are monsters?I am saying we are human.
4834,Beric,Brienne,I suppose it is the  same for women.
4835,Beric,Brienne,"Our time together is at an end, I fear."
4836,Beric,Brienne,Our lady sends for you.
4837,Brienne,Chett,You told me she had  gone to Fairmarket.And so she had.
4838,Brienne,Chett,She never sleeps herself.
4839,Brienne,Thoros,Enjoy the food?
4840,Brienne,Thoros,I  hope so.Its the last food youre ever like to eat.
4841,Brienne,Thoros,You are the Hound.
4842,Brienne,Thoros,I suppose I am.Seeing as how mlady went and killed the last one.
4843,Brienne,Thoros,"It was Rorge I killed.He took  the helm from Cleganes grave, and you stole it off his corpse.I didnt hear him objecting."
4844,Brienne,Thoros,Is this true?
4845,Brienne,Thoros,Have we fallen that  low?
4846,Brienne,Thoros,"Its good steel.There is nothing good about that helm, nor the men who wore it,Sandor  Clegane was a man in torment, and Rorge a beast in human skin.Im not them.Then why show the world their face?Savage, snarling, twisted... is that who you would be,  Lem?The sight of it will make my foes afraid.The sight of it makes me afraid.Close your eyes, then."
4847,Brienne,Thoros,Bring the whore.
4848,Brienne,Jeyne,"Mlady,Here she is.Aye,The Kingslayers whore."
4849,Brienne,Chett,"Why would you call me that?If I had a silver stag for every time you said his name, Id be as rich as your friends the  Lannisters.That was only... you do not understand...Dont we, though?"
4850,Brienne,Thoros,"I think we might.Theres a stink of lion about you,  lady.Thats not so."
4851,Brienne,Thoros,This says it is.
4852,Brienne,Thoros,There is this as well.
4853,Brienne,Thoros,It bears the boy kings seal and says the bearer is about his business.
4854,Brienne,Thoros,"The sword was given me for a good purpose,Ser Jaime swore an oath to  Catelyn Stark...... before his friends cut her throat for her, that must have been,We all know about the Kingslayer and his oaths."
4855,Jaime,Sansa,"He promised Lady Catelyn her daughters, but by the time we reached Kings Landing they  were gone.   asked the young northman, "
4856,Jaime,Sansa,Wheres that?Cerseis dungeon?No.Deny it all you want.
4857,Daenerys,Reznak," The big man turned and beckoned,  the ranks of outlaws parted, and two more captives were brought forth. he said to Lady Stoneheart."
4858,Brienne,Podrick,"Ser,My lady, I mean.Sorry.You have nothing to be sorry for."
4859,Brienne,Hyle,"Whatever treachery  you think I may have done, my lady, Podrick and Ser Hyle were no part of it.Theyre lions,Thats enough."
4860,Brienne,Hyle,"Tarlys hanged a  score o ours, past time we strung up some o his."
4861,Brienne,Hyle,"My lady,you should have wed me when I  made my offer."
4862,Brienne,Jeyne,"I dont understand.What did she say?She asked the name of this blade of yours,Oathkeeper,"
4863,Brienne,Jeyne,"No, she says."
4864,Brienne,Jeyne,"Like you.To whom have I been false?To her,Can it be that my lady has forgotten that you once swore her your  service?"
4865,Brienne,Jeyne,"That cannot be,Shes dead.Death and guest right,They dont mean so much as they used  to, neither one."
4866,Brienne,Thoros,Lady Catelyn?
4867,Harwin,Thoros,"They said... they said that you were dead.She is,The Freys slashed her throat from ear to ear."
4868,Biter,Brienne,She rose.
4869,Biter,Brienne,I  never betrayed her.
4870,Biter,Catelyn,I swear it by my sword.
4871,Brienne,Catelyn,"Words are wind, she says,She says that you must prove your faith.How?"
4872,Brienne,Jaime,With your sword.
4873,Brienne,Jaime,"Then keep your oath to her, milady says.What does she want of me?She wants her son alive, or the men who killed him dead,She wants to  feed the crows, like they did at the Red Wedding."
4874,Catelyn,Jaime,All she asks from you is Jaime Lannister.
4875,Catelyn,Jaime,"Lady Catelyn, I... you do not understand,  Jaime... he saved me from being raped when the Bloody Mummers took us, and later he came  back for me, he leapt into the bear pit empty-handed..."
4876,Catelyn,Jaime,"He sent me after Sansa to keep her safe, he could not have had a part in the Red Wedding."
4877,Daenerys,Reznak,
4878,Brienne,Catelyn,Choose.
4879,Brienne,Catelyn,I will not make that choice.
4880,Brienne,Hyle,"Hang them,As you command, mlady,"
4881,Hyle,Jaime,"If you got crimes to confess to your  gods, this would be the time to say them.Podrick has never harmed you."
4882,Jaime,Sandor,"Send Podrick with my bones to Evenfall, and youll have sapphires, silver, whatever you want.I want my wife and daughter back,Can your father give me that?"
4883,Brienne,Sandor,"Wolves will gnaw your bones.Do you mean to hang her, Lem?"
4884,Brienne,Sandor,Or do you figure to talk the bitch  to death?
4885,Brienne,Sandor,"Lets see if she can dance,"
4886,Cersei,Tywin,Septa.
4887,Cersei,Tywin,Tell his High  Holiness that we are vexed with him.He presumes too much.
4888,Moelle,Tywin,"Lady  Margaery is my sons true and gentle wife, his helpmate and consort."
4889,Megga,Moelle,I demand that he release them.
4890,Megga,Moelle,"I shall convey Your Graces words to His High  Holiness, but it grieves me to say that the young queen and her ladies cannot be released until  and unless their innocence has been proved.Innocence?Why, you need only look upon their sweet young faces to see how innocent they  are.A sweet face oft hides a sinners heart."
4891,Elinor,Megga,"What offense have these young maids  been accused of, and by whom?"
4892,Alla,Cersei,"All this Queen Margaery has also been accused of, as well as  adultery and high treason."
4893,Cersei,Harys,Tell me who is spreading such calumnies about my good- daughter!
4894,Cersei,Harys,"My sweet son loves Lady Margaery with all his heart,  she could never have been so cruel as to play him false.The accuser is a knight of your own household.Ser Osney Kettleblack has confessed his  carnal knowledge of the queen to the High Septon himself, before the altar of the Father."
4895,Margaery,Osfryd,"Ser Osney is young and lusty, I will grant you,"
4896,Margaery,Osfryd,Margaery is a maiden!She is not.
4897,Elinor,Megga,Both were found to have been broken.
4898,Moelle,Olenna,"Lady Margaery had sworn solemn oaths  attesting to her maidenhood, to Her Grace the queen and her late father."
4899,Moelle,Olenna,"Would you have us believe that all of these noble people lied to us?Perhaps they were deceived as well, my lord,I cannot speak to this.I can  only swear to the truth of what I discovered for myself when I examined the queen."
4900,Cersei,Pycelle,"We insist that His High Holiness allow our own  maesters to examine my good-daughter, to determine if there is any shred of truth to these  slanders.Grand Maester Pycelle, you shall accompany Septa Moelle back to Beloved Baelors  Sept, and return to us with the truth about our Margaerys maidenhead."
4901,Cersei,Pycelle,There is no need for me to examine her... her  privy parts.
4902,Cersei,Pycelle,"I grieve to say... Queen Margaery is no maiden.She has  required me to make her moon tea, not once, but many times."
4903,Aurane,Orton,"The smallfolk are fond of the little queen,They will  not take well to this.I fear what might happen next, Your Grace.Lord Merryweather is right,If it please Your Grace, I will launch the rest  of our new dromonds.The sight of them upon the Blackwater with King Tommens banner   flying from their masts will remind the city who rules here, and keep them safe should the mobs  decide to run riot again."
4904,Harys,Stannis,"A prudent measure,Until this storm has passed, I want your ships  crewed and on the water."
4905,Cersei,Harys,"When word of this reaches  Lord Tyrell, his fury will know no bounds."
4906,Daenerys,Reznak,
4907,Harys,Margaery,"Tommen loves them both, I know, and would want me  to make peace between them.Peace?"
4908,Cersei,Harys,"If peace is possible... that is very  brave of you.Some sort of trial may be necessary,to disprove these base calumnies and  lies and show the world that our sweet Margaery is the innocent we all know her to be.Aye,but this High Septon may want to try the queen himself, as the  Faith once tried men of old."
4909,Dorcas,Tommen,"The  important thing is to find the truth, I am sure we all agree,And now, my lords, you  must excuse me."
4910,Dorcas,Tommen,He should not be alone at such a time.
4911,Cersei,Margaery,"Whats that for, Mother?Why are you crying?"
4912,Cersei,Margaery,You are  mistaken.A lion never cries.
4913,Margaery,Tommen,There are some warrants that I need you to sign.
4914,Blue,Osfryd,So many.
4915,Blue,Osfryd,Ten.
4916,Osfryd,Tallad,A few  may well be innocent.
4917,Margaery,Osfryd,"Well have them all before the sun comes up, Your Grace."
4918,Margaery,Osfryd,Theres a  crowd gathering outside the door of Baelors Sept.What sort of crowd?
4919,Margaery,Osfryd,How many?A hundred or so.
4920,Margaery,Osfryd,"We can send  them running, if you like.No."
4921,Margaery,Osfryd,He only listens to the  gods.
4922,Osfryd,Tallad,The Faith has its own knights now.
4923,Osfryd,Tallad,"No one is to enter or leave Kings Landing without my leave, until all this is done and  settled.As you command, Your Grace."
4924,Cersei,Qyburn,"Hamish is having difficulty breathing,He is calling for a maester.Tell him he can have one as soon as he confesses."
4925,Cersei,Qyburn,"He is too old to  have been amongst the lovers, but no doubt he was made to play and sing for Margaery whilst  she was entertaining other men.We will need details.I shall help him to remember them, Your Grace."
4926,Cersei,Qyburn,"Nothing too rich or colorful,Something suitably devout and drab for the High  Septon.Hes like to make me pray with him."
4927,Jaime,Taena,"Whilst I am  comforting my good-daughter you shall speak with the three cousins,Win Alla  if you can, but be careful what you say.The gods may not be the only ones listening."
4928,Boros,Taena,"Margaerys mob may not have the wit to tell one Kettleblack from another,and I cannot have you cutting through the commons."
4929,Cersei,Taena,"This trial,what if Margaery demands that her guilt or innocence be determined by  wager of battle?"
4930,Aemon,Cersei,"As queen, her honor must be defended by a knight of the  Kingsguard."
4931,Balon,Jaime,"With Ser Loras so  gravely wounded, though, I fear Prince Aemons part must fall to one of his Sworn Brothers."
4932,Balon,Jaime,"Who, though?  "
4933,Cersei,Taena,"Yes, and Ser Meryn has been feeling ill of late.Remind me to tell him that when we return to  the castle.I shall, my sweet."
4934,Cersei,Taena,"I pray that I never offend you.You are  terrible when roused.Any mother would do the same to protect her children,When do you mean to  bring that boy of yours to court?"
4935,Baelor,Cersei,"He could train with Tommen.That would thrill the boy, I know... but things are so uncertain just now, I thought it best to  wait until the danger passed.Soon enough,Send word to Longtable and have Russell pack his best  doublet and his wooden sword.A new young friend will be just the thing to help Tommen forget  his loss, after Margaerys little head has rolled."
4936,Cersei,Small,"I am here to see my good-daughter,His High Holiness has been expecting you."
4937,Cersei,Small,If Your Grace will come with me.
4938,Cersei,Chett,Your Grace.This is a sad day.Very sad.Do we have your leave to speak with Margaery and her cousins?
4939,Cersei,Margaery,If that is your wish.
4940,Cersei,Margaery,"We must pray together, you and I."
4941,Margaery,Megga,"They took my clothes from me,I wore a gown of ivory lace, with freshwater pearls on the  bodice, but the septas laid their hands on me and stripped me to the skin."
4942,Alla,Cersei,"She went  as white as milk, too frightened even to cry.Poor child."
4943,Cersei,Margaery,"Lady  Taena has gone to speak with her, to let her know that she is not forgotten.He will not even let me see them,He keeps each of us apart from the  others."
4944,Cersei,Margaery,Last night I confessed to Septa Unella that I wished to scratch her eyes out.
4945,Alla,Margaery,"They are questioning your cousins the same way.Damn them, then,Damn them all to seven hells."
4946,Cersei,Margaery,  All three.My cousins?
4947,Cersei,Margaery,Alla and Megga are hardly more than children.
4948,Cersei,Margaery,Will you take us out of here?Would that I could.
4949,Cersei,Margaery,His High Holiness has his new knights  guarding you.To free you I would need to send the gold cloaks and profane this holy place with  killing.
4950,Cersei,Margaery,"I have not been idle, though."
4951,Cersei,Osney,"They will tell His High Holiness of your  innocence, I am certain, and swear to it at your trial.Trial?"
4952,Cersei,Margaery,Must there be a trial?How else will you prove your innocence?
4953,Cersei,Margaery,"It is your right to decide the manner of the trial, to be sure."
4954,Loras,Margaery,The knights of  the Kingsguard are sworn to defend you.
4955,Loras,Margaery,A trial by battle?  
4956,Boros,Meryn,Is that a jape?
4957,Loras,Osmund,"If theres to be a trial by battle, I want Garlan as my  champion.Ser Garlan is not a member of the Kingsguard,When the queens honor is at  issue, law and custom require that her champion be one of the kings sworn seven.The High  Septon will insist, I fear."
4958,Cersei,Margaery,"Blount or Trant,It would have to be one of them."
4959,Cersei,Margaery,Osney  Kettleblack would cut either one to pieces.
4960,Cersei,Margaery,"You wrong me, daughter.  "
4961,Cersei,Pycelle,Leave me.You are being foolish.I am only here to help you.To help me to my grave.
4962,Cersei,Pycelle,"Will you make me call my gaolers and have  you dragged away, you vile, scheming, evil bitch?"
4963,Cersei,Pycelle,This must be very frightening for you.I shall forgive  those words.
4964,Blue,Pycelle,"I would be afraid as  well, in your place."
4965,Blue,Pycelle,I fear you may soon be in dire need of both.
4966,Cersei,Chett,"You spoke with the queen,"
4967,Cersei,Chett,"I did.All men sin, even kings and queens."
4968,Cersei,Maegor,The queen will not confess.Perhaps she is innocent.She is not.
4969,Cersei,Maegor,"Others  have lain with her as well, he says, and names many names of men both great and humble.My gold cloaks have taken all of them to the dungeons,Only one has  yet been questioned, a singer called the Blue Bard."
4970,Cersei,Maegor,"Even so, I  pray that when my good-daughter is brought to trial, her innocence may yet be proved."
4971,Cersei,Maegor,"Tommen loves his little queen so much, Your Holiness, I fear it might be hard for him  or his lords to judge her justly.Perhaps the Faith should conduct the trial?"
4972,Cersei,Maegor,"I have had the selfsame thought, Your Grace."
4973,Cersei,Margaery,Who could be more suited to judge the wickedness  of women?That would be for the best.
4974,Cersei,Margaery,"If so, her champion must be one of Tommens  Seven.The knights of the Kingsguard have served as the rightful champions of king and queen since  the days of Aegon the Conqueror.Crown and Faith speak as one on this."
4975,Cersei,Tommen,"These are sad days indeed,"
4976,Osney,Tommen,Together you and I must find  the truth.We shall.I must return to the castle.
4977,Cersei,Osney,"The small council will want to question him, and hear his accusations for themselves.No,"
4978,Cersei,Tywin,"Ser Osney will be held securely, I promise  you.He is held securely here."
4979,Cersei,Tywin,I will show you.
4980,Osney,Tywin,"After you, Your Grace."
4981,Margaery,Osney,"What have  you done?We have sought after the truth, most earnestly.He told you the truth.He came to you of his own free will and confessed his sins.Aye."
4982,Margaery,Osney,"I have heard many men confess, Your Grace, but seldom have I heard a man  so pleased to be so guilty.You whipped him!There can be no penance without pain."
4983,Margaery,Osney,"I seldom feel so close to god as when I am being whipped for mine own wickedness,  though my darkest sins are no wise near as black as his.B-but,you preach the Mothers mercy..."
4984,Margaery,Osney,"Osney Kettleblack is guilty of  treason and murder, and the wages of treason are death."
4985,Margaery,Osney,"It is not for the Faith to condemn a man to death,  whatever his offense.Whatever his offense."
4986,Margaery,Osney,"Strange  to say, Your Grace, the more diligently we applied the scourge, the more Ser Osneys offenses  seemed to change."
4987,Margaery,Osney,"Is that  not so, Ser Osney?"
4988,Daenerys,Reznak,"The Wall. said Cersei. said the High Septon, in a firm, clear voice, "
4989,Cersei,Osney,That one there.
4990,Cersei,Osney,I just come  in when he was sleeping and pushed a pillow down across his face.
4991,Cersei,Taena,"I am the queen,I will have your heads for this, I will have all your heads.Let me  pass."
4992,Margaery,Scolera,"You cannot do this,I am a Lannister, unhand me, my brother will kill you, Jaime will slice you open from  throat to cunt, unhand me!I am the queen!The queen should pray,"
4993,Cersei,Joffrey,Who are you?
4994,Cersei,Joffrey,Are you come to set me free?I am Septa Unella.I am come to hear you tell of all your murders and fornications.
4995,Cersei,Joffrey,I will have your head.
4996,Cersei,Joffrey,Get  away.
4997,Cersei,Joffrey,Your Grace.
4998,Cersei,Joffrey,Mayhaps by then you will be ready to  confess.
4999,Cersei,Qyburn,"Qyburn,oh, gods, I am so glad to  see your face."
5000,Cersei,Maegor,Tommen.
5001,Cersei,Maegor,"Is he still king?He is, Your Grace."
5002,Blue,Maegor,  difficulties?
5003,Blue,Maegor,"What of Margaery?She is to be tried as well, by the same court that conducts your trial."
5004,Blue,Margaery,"My whisperers tell me that they are whipping him, but so far he is still singing the  same sweet song we taught him."
5005,Margaery,Osfryd,"Where are my knights?  The king has removed him from  office and raised the captain of the Dragon Gate in his place, a certain Humfrey Waters."
5006,Cersei,Harys,"Why would Tommen do that?The boy is not to blame.When his council puts a decree in front of him, he signs his name and  stamps it with his seal.My council... who?"
5007,Harys,Pycelle,"Not you?Alas, I have been dismissed from the council, although for the nonce they allow me to  continue my work with the eunuchs whisperers."
5008,Pycelle,Taena,"Mace   Tyrell has abandoned his siege of Storms End and is marching back to the city with his army,  and Randyll Tarly is reported on his way down from Maidenpool as well.Has Lord Merryweather agreed to this?Merryweather has resigned his seat on the council and fled back to Longtable with his wife,  who was the first to bring us news of the... accusations... against Your Grace.They let Taena go."
5009,Harys,Taena,What of Lord Waters?  
5010,Cersei,Stannis,"Pycelle believes that he is sailing to the Stepstones, to set himself up as a pirate.All my lovely dromonds."
5011,Cersei,Stannis,My lord father used to say that bastards are  treacherous by nature.Would that I had listened.
5012,Cersei,Stannis,"I am lost, Qyburn.No."
5013,Cersei,Stannis,Hope remains.
5014,Daenerys,Reznak,
5015,Kevan,Qyburn,The gods make japes of  all our hopes and plans.
5016,Kevan,Qyburn,My honor can only be defended by a Sworn Brother of the  Kingsguard.I see.
5017,Kevan,Qyburn,"Your Grace, I am at a loss."
5018,Kevan,Qyburn,"Qyburn, for the love you bear me, I beg you, send a message for me."
5019,Jaime,Kevan,  
5020,Jaime,Kevan,Come at once.
5021,Jaime,Kevan,Come at once.As you command.I love you thrice?Thrice.
5022,Jaime,Kevan,He will come.
5023,Jaime,Kevan,"Jaime is my only  hope.My queen,"
5024,Daenerys,Reznak,"  We will leave this world together, as we once came into it."
5025,Edmure,Jaime,Not  with my life at stake.
5026,Edmure,Jaime,"We have been deceived,This man had played us false!"
5027,Edmure,Emmon,"I will have his head off!   said his wife, "
5028,Edmure,Emmon,"The stableboys know about the kings decree.I am the lord, and I will have his head!For what crime?"
5029,Emmon,Jaime,I did all that was asked of me.Oh?
5030,Brynden,Jaime,"I do not recall asking you to let Ser Brynden escape.You required me to surrender my castle, not my uncle.Am I to blame if your men let him slip  through their siege lines?"
5031,Brynden,Jaime,Where is he?
5032,Brynden,Edmure,He never told me where he meant to go.And you never asked.How did he get out?Fish swim.Even black ones.
5033,Edmure,Jaime,We have oubliettes beneath the  Casterly Rock that fit a man as tight as a suit of armor.
5034,Edmure,Jaime,Would you care to reconsider that  answer?
5035,Edmure,Jaime,"You gave me your word that I would be treated honorably,  as befits my rank.So you shall,Nobler knights than you have died whimpering in those oubliettes,  and many a high lord too."
5036,Catelyn,Edmure,"I would not want to part you.He did swim,"
5037,Catelyn,Jaime,We raised the portcullis on the  Water Gate.
5038,Catelyn,Jaime,"After dark, he pulled himself  beneath the spikes."
5039,Emmon,Jaime,"You have to find him,Hell be found."
5040,Addam,Jaime,I have hounds and hunters  sniffing after him even now.
5041,Brynden,Emmon,"He may elude us for a time,but eventually  he must surface.What if he should try and take my castle back?You have a garrison of two hundred."
5042,Brynden,Genna,"After the trouble Ser Brynden took to leave  us, I doubt that hell come skulking back."
5043,Brynden,Genna,"This is your seat,It is for you to hold it.If you cannot do that,  put it to the torch and run back to the Rock."
5044,Edmure,Genna,"To be  sure.Riverrun is mine, and no man shall ever take it from me."
5045,Edmure,Jaime,Is there any more that you would care to tell me?
5046,Edmure,Jaime,"This was my fathers solar,He ruled the riverlands from here, wisely and well."
5047,Forley,Jaime,You will never know how much  I despise you.
5048,Forley,Jaime,"I have been despised by better men than you, Edmure."
5049,Forley,Jaime,Take his lordship back to his tower and see that hes fed.
5050,Brynden,Jaime,Lord Commander?
5051,Brynden,Jaime,"Lady Westerling and her daughter  are without, as you commanded."
5052,Jaime,Jeyne,Show them in.
5053,Jaime,Jeyne,What happened there?
5054,Jeyne,Robb,"It is nothing,"
5055,Jeyne,Robb,"She  would not give up the little crown the rebel gave her, and when I tried to take it from her head  the willful child fought me.It was mine."
5056,Jeyne,Robb,You had no right.
5057,Jaime,Robb,I loved him.
5058,Jaime,Sybell,"None of that,Sit down, both of you."
5059,Jaime,Sybell,Will you have wine?
5060,Jaime,Jeyne,"No, thank you,As you will."
5061,Jaime,Jeyne,I am sorry for your loss.
5062,Jaime,Jeyne,"Are you carrying his child, my lady?"
5063,Jaime,Sybell,"She is not,I made  certain of that, as your lord father bid me."
5064,Jeyne,Tywin,"Unhand the girl,Im done with her for now."
5065,Jeyne,Sybell,"House Westerling has its pardon, and your brother Rolph has been made Lord of  Castamere.What else would you have of us?Your lord father promised me worthy marriages for Jeyne and her younger sister.Lords or  heirs, he swore to me, not younger sons nor household knights."
5066,Sybell,Walder,"Youll have your marriages,but Jeyne must wait two full years before she weds again."
5067,Tywin,Walder,"I have two sons as well,Rollam is with me, but Raynald  was a knight and went with the rebels to the Twins.If I had known what was to happen there, I  would never have allowed that."
5068,Tywin,Walder,Raynald knew  nought of any... of the understanding with your lord father.He may be a captive at the Twins.
5069,Tywin,Walder,"I will  make inquiries.If Ser Raynald is still a captive, well pay his ransom for you.Mention was made of a match for him as well."
5070,Tywin,Walder,"Your lord father  said that Raynald should have joy of him, if all went as we hoped."
5071,Sybell,Tywin,Joy is my late uncle Gerions  natural daughter.
5072,Jaime,Sybell,Joy was nine or ten when last I saw her.His natural daughter?
5073,Jaime,Sybell,You want a  Westerling to wed a bastard?No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch.She deserves  better.
5074,Edmure,Jaime,"Your daughter is  worth ten of you, my lady."
5075,Edmure,Forley,"Until then,  you would do well to stay out of my sight."
5076,Forley,Jaime,"We  dont know where the Brynden is,but if he can cut Edmure free, he  will.That will not happen, my lord."
5077,Forley,Jaime,"Scouts  and outriders will screen our march, and well fortify our camps by night."
5078,Forley,Jaime,"If he should ride so much as a foot off  the road, they will loose so many shafts at him that his own mother would take him for a goose.Good."
5079,Forley,Jaime,Best keep some archers near Lord Westerlings daughter as well.
5080,Forley,Jaime,"Gawens girl?   Jaime finished, "
5081,Jaime,Walder,"Lord Commander,My  fathers blood is on your hands, ser."
5082,Jaime,Walder,"How so?You were the one who sent him home, were you not?"
5083,Jaime,Walder,"Has some ill befallen Ser Ryman?Hanged with all his party,The outlaws caught them two leagues south  of Fairmarket.Dondarrion?Him, or Thoros, or this woman Stoneheart."
5084,Edwyn,Walder,How many men did Ser Ryman have with him?
5085,Edwyn,Walder,"Three knights and a dozen men-at-arms,It is almost as if they knew that he  would be returning to the Twins, and with a small escort."
5086,Edwyn,Petyr,"My brother had a hand in this, Ill wager."
5087,Petyr,Walder,"With our father dead, theres only  me left between Black Walder and the Twins.You have no proof of this,I do not need proof.I know my brother.Your brother is at Seagard,How could he have known that Ser Ryman was  returning to the Twins?Someone told him,He has his spies in our camp, you can be  sure."
5088,Edwyn,Walder,"If you will pardon me for intruding on your grief,we have other  matters to consider."
5089,Edwyn,Walder,"These prisoners are valuable, ser.His Grace would not ask for them if they were worthless."
5090,Edwyn,Jaime,My lord grandfather will expect recompense  for these prisoners.
5091,Edwyn,Jaime,"We all have expectations,Tell me, is Ser Raynald Westerling amongst these captives?The knight of seashells?"
5092,Edwyn,Walder,"Youll find that one feeding the fish at the bottom  of the Green Fork.He was in the yard when our men came to put the direwolf down,Whalen demanded his sword and he gave it over meek enough, but when the crossbowmen  began feathering the wolf he seized Whalens axe and cut the monster loose of the net theyd  thrown over him.Whalen says he took a quarrel in his shoulder and another in the gut, but still  managed to reach the wallwalk and throw himself into the river.He left a trail of blood on the steps,Did you find his corpse afterward?"
5093,Edwyn,Jaime,"We found a thousand corpses afterward.Once theyve spent a few days in the river they all  look much the same.Ive heard the same is true of hanged men,"
5094,Daven,Scar,I mean to deal with Lord Tytos myself.It  wont require a siege tower.
5095,Daven,Scar,"Single combat, coz?"
5096,Daven,Scar,Tytos is an old  grey man.
5097,Ilyn,Jaime,"If I keep at this for another year, I may be as good  as Peck,Come, lets drink some more of Hoster Tullys good red wine."
5098,Cersei,Ilyn,"I should have the tongues removed from all my friends,"
5099,Cersei,Ilyn,Though Id miss her tongue when we   kissed.
5100,Cersei,Ilyn,I  cant remember when we first began to kiss.
5101,Cersei,Ilyn,Until it wasnt.
5102,Cersei,Ilyn,Tyrion once told me that most whores will not kiss you.
5103,Ilyn,Osmund,Do you think my sister kisses  Kettleblack?
5104,Ilyn,Osmund,I dont think it would be proper for me to slay mine own Sworn Brother.
5105,Ilyn,Jaime,"All of it, save what to do with Cersei."
5106,Ilyn,Jaime,"No,Tommen has lost a brother, and the man he thought of as his father.If I were  to kill his mother, he would hate me for it... and that sweet little wife of his would find a way to  turn that hatred to the benefit of Highgarden."
5107,Ilyn,Jaime,"You talk too much,"
5108,Daenerys,Reznak,Wolves.
5109,Jaime,Joffrey,"Armed men in mail and  boiled leather, and yet the beasts had no fear of them."
5110,Jaime,Joffrey,"The bloody bastards killed my favorite bay.A ring of fires round your camp might keep them off,"
5111,Jaime,Marq,"All the captives will be ransomed,Lord Jaime, you must go to  Raventree."
5112,Edmure,Jaime,We rode across half the bloody realm and for what?
5113,Beric,Jaime,"Him, or the  marcher lord.Sandors head is yours if you can take it,but Beric Dondarrion is to be  captured alive, so he can be brought back to Kings Landing."
5114,Emmon,Jaime,"They are lying,If you share your plans with no one, no one can betray you,"
5115,Edmure,Jaime,"I gave  Edmure my word that if he yielded, the garrison could leave unharmed.That was chivalrous of you,but its strength thats needed here, not chivalry."
5116,Emmon,Genna,"If youre fortunate, one man in ten may  keep that vow,Good."
5117,Emmon,Genna,The tenth might have been the one who would have  killed me.The other nine will kill you just as quick.Better that than die in bed.
5118,Jaime,Robin,"This castles been my home for forty years,You say Im free to go, but   where?"
5119,Jaime,Robin,"But men are always welcome at the  Wall.As you wish,"
5120,Emmon,Rafford,"See to it that  the prisoners reach Maidenpool unspoiled,or what Ser Gregor did to the Goat  will seem a jolly lark compared to what Ill do to you."
5121,Jaime,Ryman,"His lordship should have been a  singer,This speech is longer than a marcher ballad, and I dont think hes  stopped for breath."
5122,Jaime,Ryman,"Lord Emmon does not need to breathe, so long as he can chew.Are you  going to make a song of it?A funny one.Ill call it Talking to the Fish.Just dont play it where my aunt can hear."
5123,Forley,Jaime,Werent you Ser Rymans man when I found you?
5124,Forley,Jaime,"Only for a fortnight.I would have expected you to depart with the Freys.That one up theres a Frey,"
5125,Forley,Jaime,"Begging my lords pardon.You should get on famously with my aunt,If you hope to winter here, see that  your playing pleases Lady Genna.Shes the one that matters.Not you?My place is with the king.I shall not stay here long.Im sorry to hear that, my lord."
5126,Baelor,Jaime,"I could  have played you... oh, all sorts o things.Some other time,Do you have a name?Tom of Sevenstreams, if it please my lord."
5127,Baelor,Jaime,"Most call me Tom o  Sevens, though.Sing sweetly, Tom o Sevens."
5128,Baelor,Cersei,Sister?
5129,Baelor,Cersei,"Sister,what would you have of me?"
5130,Baelor,Cersei,"I am not your sister, Jaime."
5131,Baelor,Cersei,Have you  forgotten me?
5132,Daenerys,Reznak,Will you forget your own lord father too?
5133,Jaime,Tywin,He could never abide being laughed at.That was  the thing he hated most.Who are you?
5134,Jaime,Tywin,"The question is, who are you?This is a dream.Is it?"
5135,Jaime,Tywin,"Count your hands, child."
5136,Jaime,Tywin,In my dreams I always have  two hands.
5137,Jaime,Tywin,We all dream of things we cannot have.
5138,Jaime,Tywin,"He dreamed they would be so strong and brave and beautiful  that no one would ever laugh at them.I am a knight,and Cersei is a queen."
5139,Cersei,Vyman,"See who that is, Peck."
5140,Jaime,Vyman,"I know,there has been a white  raven from the Citadel."
5141,Daenerys,Reznak,
5142,Jaime,Vyman,Does  my lord wish to answer?
5143,Jaime,Vyman,"No,Put  this in the fire."
5144,Dalla,Gilly,"Three Towers,the seat of  House Costayne."
5145,Dalla,Gilly,"Its very tall,Wait until you see the Hightower."
5146,Samwell,Xhondo,"Battle here,Not so long.Who would be so mad as to raid this close to Oldtown?"
5147,Samwell,Xhondo,Whose banner is  that?
5148,Chett,Quhuru,"My apologies,It grieves me that honest  men must suffer such discourtesy, but sooner that than ironmen in Oldtown."
5149,Chett,Samwell,"When he saw all the green and purple beards he hailed them in  the tongue of Tyrosh, and not one of them had the words to hail him back."
5150,Chett,Samwell,They cannot mean to raid Oldtown.
5151,Chett,Samwell,These are no mere reavers.
5152,Baelor,Samwell,"Without Lord Redwynes fleet, we lack the ships to come to grips with them.What is Lord Hightower doing?"
5153,Baelor,Samwell,"My father always said he was as wealthy as  the Lannisters, and could command thrice as many swords as any of Highgardens other  bannermen.More, if he sweeps the cobblestones,but swords are no good against the  ironmen, unless the men who wield them know how to walk on water.The Hightower must be doing something.To be sure."
5154,Garth,Samwell,"Till then, the best we can do is guard the sound and wait  for the bitch queen in Kings Landing to let Lord Paxter off his leash."
5155,Gilly,Samwell,"First the Citadel, to present Jons letters and  tell them of Maester Aemons death."
5156,Gilly,Samwell,"I will be back  as soon as I can, but it may not be until the morrow.The morrow,"
5157,Chett,Samwell,"How long will you remain in port?Two days, ten days, who can say?However long it takes to empty our holds and fill them  again."
5158,Chett,Samwell,My father must visit the grey maesters as well.He has books to sell.Can Gilly stay aboard till I return?Gilly can stay as long as she likes.
5159,Chett,Samwell,"She does not  eat so much as some.Im not so fat as I was before,"
5160,Dick,Samwell,"Stealing food from the kitchens,"
5161,Jon,Samwell,Good morrow.
5162,Jon,Samwell,You smell of novice.I hope to be one soon.
5163,Jon,Samwell,"I came from the  Wall with Maester Aemon, but he died during the voyage.  "
5164,Jon,Samwell,Sit.Youll be called when wanted.
5165,Chett,Samwell,How much longer will it be?The Seneschal is an important man.I came all the way from the Wall.Then you will have no trouble going a bit farther.
5166,Chett,Samwell,"To that bench just  there, beneath the window."
5167,Chett,Samwell,"You need to slip Lorcas a penny, or youll be waiting here three days,What brings the Nights Watch to the Citadel?"
5168,Chett,Samwell,"The Lord Commander is restoring   the abandoned castles,We need more maesters, for the ravens... did you say, a  penny?A penny will serve."
5169,Chett,Samwell,"He hates novices, particularly novices of noble birth.How could you tell I was of noble birth?The same way you can tell that Im half Dornish."
5170,Chett,Samwell,"Are you a novice?An acolyte.Alleras, by some called Sphinx."
5171,Chett,Samwell,"The sphinx is the riddle, not the riddler,Do you know  what that means?No.Is it a riddle?I wish I knew."
5172,Aemon,Samwell,  And what business does Samwell Tarly have with Archmaester Theobald?Is he the Seneschal?
5173,Aemon,Samwell,Maester Aemon said his name was Norren.Not for the past two turns.
5174,Aemon,Samwell,Did you say Maester Aemon?Aye.Aemon Targaryen?Once.
5175,Aemon,Samwell,How is it that  you know of him?How not?
5176,Aemon,Samwell,"How old was he, do you know?One hundred and two.What was he doing at sea, at his age?"
5177,Aemon,Stannis,"Lord Commander Snow sent him away to save his life,"
5178,Alleras,Jon,"Daenerys is the only hope,Aemon said the Citadel must send her a  maester at once, to bring her home to Westeros before it is too late."
5179,Daenerys,Reznak,"Save your penny, Samwell Theobald will not believe half of that, but there are those who  might."
5180,Aemon,Samwell,Very  well.
5181,Aemon,Alleras,How  far do we have to go?Not far.The Isle of Ravens.
5182,Alleras,Samwell,"The Ravenry is the oldest building at the Citadel,In the Age of Heroes it was  supposedly the stronghold of a pirate lord who sat here robbing ships as they came down the  river."
5183,Alleras,Samwell,"Archmaester Walgrave has his chambers in the west  tower, below the white rookery,The white ravens and the black ones quarrel  like Dornishmen and Marchers, so they keep them apart.Will Archmaester Walgrave understand what I am telling him?You said his  wits were prone to wander.He has good days and bad ones,but it is not Walgrave youre going to see."
5184,Alleras,Samwell,What are you looking for?
5185,Alleras,Samwell,Your destiny?Your death?
5186,Alleras,Samwell,"Naked women,Whos this now?Samwell.A new novice, come to see the Mage.The Citadel is not what it was,They will take anything these days."
5187,Alleras,Samwell,And here I  thought leviathans were grey.
5188,Leo,Samwell,Leo Tyrell.
5189,Leo,Samwell,I am Samwell from Horn Hill.Lord Randyll Tarlys son.Truly?
5190,Leo,Samwell,I suppose you are.
5191,Jon,Samwell,Or was it only that he wished you were?
5192,Jon,Samwell,"Are you still a craven?No,I went beyond the Wall and fought in battles.They call me Samwellthe Slayer."
5193,Leo,Marwyn,"Get in here, Slayer,And you, Sphinx.Now.Samwellthis is Archmaester Marwyn."
5194,Marwyn,Samwell,"Is that...?... obsidian,Call it dragonglass."
5195,Marwyn,Samwell,It burns but is  not consumed.What feeds the flame?What feeds a dragons fire?
5196,Marwyn,Samwell,All Valyrian sorcery was  rooted in blood or fire.
5197,Alleras,Samwell,"Do you think that might  be useful, Slayer?We would have no more need of ravens.Only after battles."
5198,Alleras,Samwell,"Tell me all you told our Dornish sphinx.I know much of it and more, but  some small parts may have escaped my notice."
5199,Alleras,Marwyn,"Maester Aemon believed that Daenerys Targaryen was  the fulfillment of a prophecy... her, not Stannis, nor Prince Rhaegar, nor the princeling whose  head was dashed against the wall.Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star.I know the prophecy."
5200,Alleras,Marwyn,Not that I would trust it.
5201,Aemon,Marwyn,Prophecy will bite your prick off every time.
5202,Aemon,Marwyn,Still...Aemon would have gone to her if he had the strength.
5203,Marwyn,Samwell,"Perhaps its good that he died before he got to  Oldtown.Elsewise the grey sheep might have had to kill him, and that would have made the poor  old dears wring their wrinkled hands.Kill him?"
5204,Marwyn,Samwell,"Why?If I tell you, they may need to kill you too."
5205,Aemon,Samwell,Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time  around?Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?
5206,Aemon,Samwell,"The world the Citadel is building  has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons."
5207,Aemon,Alleras,No more than I  can.What will you do?
5208,Alleras,Marwyn,"Get myself to Slavers Bay, in Aemons place."
5209,Marwyn,Samwell,With  fair winds I should reach her first.
5210,Marwyn,Samwell,You... you  should stay and forge your chain.
5211,Aemon,Samwell,A time will come when  youll be needed on the Wall.
5212,Aemon,Samwell,"Find Slayer a dry cell.Hell  sleep here, and help you tend the ravens.B-b-but,the other archmaesters... the Seneschal... what should I tell them?Tell them how wise and good they are."
5213,Alleras,Marwyn,"But say nothing of prophecies or dragons, unless you fancy poison in your  porridge."
5214,Alleras,Marwyn,"Sphinx, look after this one.I will,"
5215,Alleras,Samwell,Where has he gone?
5216,Alleras,Samwell,To the docks.The Mage is not a man who believes in wasting time.
5217,Alleras,Samwell,I have a  confession.
5218,Alleras,Samwell,He knew that you were coming.How?
5219,Alleras,Samwell,"Theres an empty sleeping cell under mine in the west tower, with steps that lead right up to  Walgraves chambers,If you dont mind the ravens quorking,  theres a good view of the Honeywine.Will that serve?I suppose."
5220,Alleras,Samwell,"I will bring you some woolen coverlets.Stone walls turn cold at night, even here.My thanks.My names not Slayer, truly. the other said, "
5221,Daenerys,Tyrion,"Wait a minute, wait a  minute!"
5222,Jon,Tyrion,.
5223,Jon,Tyrion,To Be Continued.
5224,Falyse,Osmund,"gold cloakssparrows,"
5225,Edric,Stannis,"the wildling prince,PORRIDGELAMPREY,"
5226,Balon,Torrhen,"drowned men,"
5227,Daenerys,Reznak,"This is a filler string intended to act as a buffer between chapters to help prevent characters from leaking over into the previous chapter thereby really messing up the distance metrics.STARK,"
5228,Dalla,Jon,"the wildling princess,"
5229,Daenerys,Missandei,"Your Grace,there is no  need for you to see this.He died for me."
5230,Jhiqui,Missandei,"Khaleesi,you must not touch the dead man."
5231,Daenerys,Irri,"That is known.It is known,"
5232,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Your Grace,there was a harpy drawn on the bricks in the alley where he  was found...... drawn in his own blood."
5233,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Grey Worm, why was this man  alone?Had he no partner?"
5234,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"My queen,your servant Stalwart Shield had no duty last night."
5235,Barristan,Daenerys,What could a eunuch hope to find in a brothel?
5236,Barristan,Daenerys,"Even those who lack a mans parts may still have a mans heart, Your Grace,This one has been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave coin to the  women of the brothels, to lay with him and hold him."
5237,Barristan,Daenerys,"Stalwart Shield,That was his  name?If it please Your Grace.It is a fine name."
5238,Barristan,Daenerys,"Is it known how many attackers fell upon Stalwart Shield?This one does not know.Many.Six or more,From the look of his wounds, they swarmed him from all  sides."
5239,Barristan,Daenerys,It may be that he wounded some of his attackers.
5240,Barristan,Daenerys,"Why did they cut open his cheeks like that?Gracious queen,his killers had forced the genitals of a goat down the  throat of your servant Stalwart Shield."
5241,Barristan,Daenerys,"The  Sons grow bolder,"
5242,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"This is the first of my soldiers they have slain.The first,but not the last."
5243,Grey Worm,Jhiqui,"Stalwart Shield shall not be  forgotten.Have him washed and dressed for battle, and bury him with cap and shield and  spears.It shall be as Your Grace commands,"
5244,Grey Worm,Jhiqui,"Send a dozen men to the Temple of the Graces, and ask the Blue Graces if any man  has come to them seeking treatment for a sword wound."
5245,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Inquire of the butchers and the herdsmen too,  and learn who has been gelding goats of late."
5246,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Henceforth, see that no man of mine walks alone after dark,  whether he has the duty or no.These ones shall obey."
5247,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Find these cowards for me,Find them, so  that I might teach the Harpys Sons what it means to wake the dragon."
5248,Barristan,Daenerys,"Your Grace,I fear  your eunuchs are ill-suited for the tasks you set them."
5249,Barristan,Daenerys,"The Unsullied  are my finest warriors.Soldiers, not warriors, if it please Your Grace."
5250,Barristan,Daenerys,"Their training  teaches them to obey, fearlessly, perfectly, without thought or hesitation... not to unravel secrets  or ask questions.Would knights serve me any better?"
5251,Chett,Daenerys,"Not in this,And Your Grace has no knights, save me.It will be years  before the boys are ready.Then who, if not Unsullied?Dothraki would be even worse."
5252,Daario,Daenerys,"When the   Stormcrows return from Lhazar, perhaps I can use them in the streets,but until then I have only the Unsullied."
5253,Daario,Skahaz,"You must excuse me, ser,The petitioners will soon be  at my gates."
5254,Daenerys,Skahaz,Summon Reznak and the  Shavepate; Ill see them when Im dressed.As Your Grace commands.
5255,Daenerys,Jorah,"Youre lazy,"
5256,Irri,Jorah,You should be hunting with your brothers.Have you been fighting Drogon again?
5257,Daenerys,Galazza,"The Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever hated,In the wools of Westeros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall  forever remain a stranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conquerer.Meereens  queen must be a lady of Old Ghis."
5258,Galazza,Jhiqui,"Man wants to be the king o the rabbits, he best wear a pair o floppy ears."
5259,Irri,Reznak,"I am ready,"
5260,Reznak,Skahaz,"Great queen,you are so radiant today I fear to look on you."
5261,Daenerys,Skahaz,"You are kind to say so,My queen,"
5262,Daenerys,Skahaz,"We were told about  the eunuch.His name was Stalwart Shield.More will die, unless the murderers are punished."
5263,Daenerys,Skahaz,How can I punish them when I do not know who they are?
5264,Daenerys,Skahaz,"Tell me  that, bold Skahaz.You have no lack of enemies, Your Grace."
5265,Daenerys,Oznak,Women do  not forgive.
5266,Daenerys,Reznak,How much gold have we offered for information concerning the Sons of the Harpy?
5267,Daenerys,Reznak,"One hundred honors, if it please Your Radiance.One thousand honors would please us more.Make it so.Your Grace has not asked for my counsel,"
5268,Reznak,Skahaz,There will not be a third  murder.
5269,Reznak,Skahaz,"Noooo... gentle queen, such savagery would bring down the ire of  the gods.We will find the murderers, I promise you, and when we do they will prove to be  baseborn filth, you shall see."
5270,Daenerys,Skahaz,"Should  any hair be so insolent as to appear, my barber stands with razor ready,"
5271,Grey Worm,Missandei,"Skahaz,I thank you for your counsel."
5272,Daenerys,Missandei,"All kneel for Daenerys  Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First  Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles and Mother of Dragons,"
5273,Daenerys,Reznak,Arise.
5274,Daenerys,Irri,"Cleon the Great sends these slippers as a token of his love for Daenerys  Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons,"
5275,Daenerys,Ghael,"King Cleon is most generous,You may thank him for his lovely  gift."
5276,Cleon,Ghael,"Great Cleon will be pleased to know they pleased you,His Magnificence  bids me say that he stands ready to defend the Mother of Dragons from all her foes."
5277,Daenerys,Reznak,"The time has come for Astapor and Meereen to end the savage reign of the  Wise Masters of Yunkai, sworn foes to all those who live in freedom."
5278,Daenerys,Yellow,King Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens  and let the Yunkaii tend theirs.
5279,Daenerys,Ghael,"I am only a young girl and know little of the  ways of war,but it is said that Astapor is starving."
5280,Daenerys,Ghael,"Magnificence,will you hear the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq?"
5281,Daenerys,Hizdahr,"Your Radiance will know the  reason I am here.Why,it must be because you have no other purpose but to plague me.  "
5282,Chett,Hizdahr,"Have you brought new arguments?Old arguments,new words."
5283,Chett,Jacelyn,Shall I?
5284,Chett,Jacelyn,The fighting pits have been a part  of Meereen since the city was founded.
5285,Daenerys,Illyrio,"For criminals condemned to die upon the sands, the pits represent a  judgment by battle, a last chance for a man to prove his innocence."
5286,Daenerys,Illyrio,There.How have I done?Your Radiance has stated the case much better than I could have hoped to do myself.
5287,Daenerys,Illyrio,I am quite persuaded.
5288,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Very good... but I am not.Your Magnificence,if I might remind you, it is  customary for the city to claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after expenses,  as a tax. she agreed, "
5289,Hizdahr,Xaro,For the sixth time.
5290,Hizdahr,Reznak,The queen has spoken.
5291,Daenerys,Hizdahr,"Magnificence,the noble Grazdan zo Galare would address  you."
5292,Daenerys,Reznak,"They owe their skill to me,I plucked them from the auction bloc  and gave them to the loom."
5293,Daenerys,Reznak,What was the name of the  old weaver?The slave?
5294,Daenerys,Reznak,"She was... Elza, it might have been."
5295,Daenerys,Reznak,"I have owned so many slaves, Your Grace.Let us say Elza."
5296,Daenerys,Reznak,Here is our ruling.
5297,Daenerys,Reznak,You may go.
5298,Chett,Daenerys,"They can keep the clothes,"
5299,Chett,Daenerys,"When he lay  with her, your wife was his property, to do with as he would.By law, there was no rape."
5300,Belwas,Daenerys,"Enough, Belwas,Release him."
5301,Belwas,Daenerys,You should do the same.
5302,Daenerys,Reznak,"Ser Barristan,I know what quality a king needs most.Courage, Your Grace?No,cheeks like iron."
5303,Daenerys,Reznak,"How many  more?Three and twenty, if it please Your Magnificence.With as many claims."
5304,Daenerys,Reznak,"One calf and three goats.The rest will be sheep or lambs, no doubt.Three and twenty."
5305,Daenerys,Reznak,My dragons have developed a prodigious taste for mutton  since we began to pay the shepherds for their kills.Have these claims been proven?Some men have brought burnt bones.Men make fires.
5306,Daenerys,Reznak,"Must we pay good silver for every  lamb that goes astray between Yunkai and the Skahazadhan?No, Magnificence."
5307,Daenerys,Reznak,"Shall I send these rascals away, or will you want them  scourged?"
5308,Daenerys,Reznak,No man should ever fear to  come to me.Pay them.
5309,Drogo,Reznak,"Pay them  for the value of their animals,but henceforth claimants must present  themselves at the Temple of the Graces, and swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.It shall be done."
5310,Drogo,Reznak,"Her Magnificence the Queen has  consented to compensate each of you for the animals you have lost,Present yourselves to my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid in coin or kind,  as you prefer."
5311,Daenerys,Missandei,"All kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and  the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles and Mother of  Dragons,"
5312,Daenerys,Missandei,"You with  the sack,did you wish to speak with us?"
5313,Barristan,Daenerys,What is it?
5314,Barristan,Daenerys,"Do you have some grievance to lay before us, some petition?What would you have of us?"
5315,Barristan,Daenerys,I...  
5316,Daenerys,Reznak,Burnt bones?
5317,Daenerys,Reznak,"It were the black one,the winged shadow.He come down  from the sky and... and..."
5318,Daenerys,Reznak,"Are you deaf, fool?"
5319,Daenerys,Reznak,"Did you not hear my  pronouncement?See my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid for your sheep.Reznak,hold your tongue and open your eyes."
