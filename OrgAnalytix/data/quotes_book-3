0,Chett,Samwell,Seven hells.
1,Chett,Samwell,"Track, you bastards."
2,Chett,Lark,Find!
3,Chett,Lark,"Dog meat would taste as  good as bear,"
4,Lark,Small,"Its too bloody  cold to hunt,Bugger this bear, hes not worth freezing over.We cant go back emptyhand, Lark,The Lord Commander  wouldnt like that."
5,Chett,Small,"Bugger that Old Bear too,Mormont will be dead before daybreak, remember?Who cares what he likes?"
6,Lark,Small,Why do we have to kill the Old Bear?Why dont we just go off and let him be?You think hell let us be?
7,Lark,Small,"Hell hunt us down.You want to be hunted, you great  muttonhead?No,I dont want that.I dont.So youll kill him?"
8,Lark,Small,Yes.
9,Chett,Lark,I will.He shouldnt hunt us.
10,Chett,Lark,"We need to kill all the officers, I  say."
11,Chett,Dywen,We been over this.
12,Chett,Dywen,"One scream and were  wormfood, every one of us."
13,Chett,Dywen,"Just do your bit and see that your cousins do  theirs.And Paul, try and remember, its third watch, not second.Third watch,Me and Softfoot.I remember, Chett."
14,Chett,Small,"Theyre still well up the foothills, but theyre coming,Harma the Dogshead has the van, the poxy bitch."
15,Chett,Small,"That fool Tumberjon wanted to pick her off with an arrow, but Smallwood had  better sense."
16,Chett,Small,"How many were there, could you tell?Many and more."
17,Chett,Small,"Harma had five hundred in the van,  every one ahorse."
18,Chett,Small,"Smallwood sent Bannen and me wide around the van to catch a peek at the main body,There was no end of them."
19,Lark,Thoren,The  women as well.And they follow the Milkwater?
20,Lark,Thoren,"I said so, didnt I?"
21,Chett,Small,"This King-beyond-the-Wall will never look for us so far north,And this great host of his is a shambling horde, full of useless mouths who wont know what end of a  sword to hold.One blow will take all the fight out of them and send them howling back to their hovels for  another fifty years."
22,Ottyn,Small,"If we wait too Ion& this chance may be lost, never to come again,We are the shield that guards  the realms of men.You do not throw away your shield for no good purpose,In a swordfight, a mans surest defense is the swift stroke that slays his foe, not cringing  behind a shield."
23,Chett,Jon,"Theres no bear here,Just an old print, thats all.Back to the Fist."
24,Chett,Samwell,"Give my love to Lord Snow,"
25,Chett,Lark,"Im going  to make for the coast,Me and my cousins.Well build us a boat, sail  back home to the Sisters."
26,Lark,Small,"Chett,what about the bird?What bloody bird?"
27,Lark,Small,"The Old Bears raven,if we kill him, whos going to feed his bird?Who bloody well cares?Kill the bird too if you like.I dont want to hurt no bird,But thats a talking bird.What if it tells what we did?"
28,Lark,Small,"Small Paul, thick as a castle wall,You shut up with that,Paul,when they find the old man lying in a pool of blood  with his throat slit, they wont need no bird to tell them someone killed him."
29,Chett,Small,"Thats true,Can I keep the bird, then?I like that  bird.Hes yours,We can always eat him if we get hungry,"
30,Chett,Small,"Best not try and eat my bird, Lark.Best not."
31,Chett,Small,"Close your bloody mouths, both of you.Were  almost to the Fist."
32,Aemon,Lark,"Look,A pig with a bow."
33,Aemon,Chett,"You go on,I want to watch this."
34,Chett,Grenn,"Well never find that one, and Ill be blamed,Nothing ever goes missing that they dont look at me, ever since that  time I lost my  horse."
35,Chett,Grenn,"He was white and it was snowing, what did they expect?The wind took that one,Try to hold the bow steady,  SamwellIts heavy,"
36,Chett,Grenn,"I believe you knocked a leaf off that tree,Fall is falling fast enough, theres no  need to help it."
37,Chett,Grenn,And we all know what follows fall.
38,Chett,Grenn,"Shoot the last  arrow, Samwell, I believe my tongue is freezing to the roof of my mouth."
39,Chett,Grenn,"Its too hard.Notch, draw, and loose,Go on."
40,Chett,Grenn,I hit him.
41,Chett,Grenn,"Grenn, did you see?Edd, look, I hit him!Put it between his ribs, Id say,Did I kill him?"
42,Chett,Grenn,"Might have punctured a lung, if he had a lung.Most trees dont, as a rule."
43,Chett,Grenn,"Ive seen worse shots, though.Aye, and made a few."
44,Chett,Grenn,"You hit a tree,Lets see how you shoot when its Mance Rayders lads."
45,Grenn,Samwell,The  last thing youll hear will be the thunk it makes when it bites into your skull.
46,Grenn,Samwell,"Brother,just  because it happened that way for you doesnt mean Samwell will suffer the same.What are you talking about, Tollett?The axe that split your skull.Is it true that half your wits leaked out on the ground and your dogs ate  them?"
47,Chett,Jacelyn,"The prints were there like Giant said, but the dogs wouldnt track,Down by the river like that, could be old prints.A pity."
48,Chett,Jacelyn,We might all have been better for a bit of fresh meat.
49,Chett,Jacelyn,Meat.
50,Chett,Lark,"I hate that sound,It sounds like a babe in the brush, wailing  away for milk."
51,Chett,Lark,"The officers are in  the Old Bears tent again, talking something fierce.Thats what they do,Theyre highborn, all but Blane, they get drunk on words instead of  wine."
52,Chett,Lark,"Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the bird,Now hes asking if we cached any seed for the damn thing.Its a raven,It eats corpses."
53,Chett,Lark,"His, might be?"
54,Chett,Lark,"Stop fretting  about Small Paul.You do your part, hell do his."
55,Chett,Dywen,"Half a night more, and  you can find your own feast."
56,Chett,Dywen,"The woods too silent,No frogs near  that river, no owls in the dark.I never heard no deader wood than this.Them teeth of yours sound pretty dead,"
57,Chett,Dywen,No wolves neither.
58,Chett,Dywen,"Whered they  go, you figure?Someplace warm,"
59,Chett,Small,Assemble!
60,Chett,Small,Men of the Nights Watch!Assemble at the central fire!
61,Harma,Thoren,"Brothers,men of the  Nights Watch.Men!"
62,Harma,Thoren,"Men!Men!The wildlings are on the march, following the course of the Milkwater down out of the mountains."
63,Chett,Qhorin,Or so we must pray.
64,Harma,Small,Mance Rayder means to break the Wall and bring red war to the Seven  Kingdoms.
65,Harma,Small,"On the morrow well bring the war to him.We ride at dawn with all our strength,We  will ride north, and loop around to the west."
66,Small,Thoren,"We shall fall on them in several places at once, and make them swear we were  three thousand, not three hundred.Well hit hard and be away before their horsemen can form up to face us,If  they pursue, well lead them a merry chase, then wheel and hit again farther down the column."
67,Chett,Mance,"If not, well harry them all the way to the Wall, and see  to it that they leave a trail of corpses to mark their progress.There are thousands,Well die."
68,Chett,Mance,"Die,Die, die, die. Many of us,Mayhaps even all of us."
69,Chett,Lark,.The fire that bums against the cold.
70,Chett,Lark,"The light that brings the dawn,The horn that wakes the sleepers!"
71,Chett,Small,Die.
72,Chett,Jacelyn,"Snow,Snow"
73,Chett,Samwell,"Gods,"
74,Chett,Harma,Was it two?
75,Chett,Harma,I dreamed I heard two blasts.
76,Chett,Harma,". No dream,Two blasts to call the Watch to arms."
77,Harma,Mance,Two blasts means wildlings. 
78,Harma,Mance,Bugger them all to seven hells.
79,Gendry,Hot,
80,Chett,Samwell,"Three,"
81,Chett,Samwell,  
82,Cersei,Jaime,"Quiet,"
83,Catelyn,Jaime,"Youd think my word as a Lannister was not good enough,"
84,Cleos,Tyrion,"My lady,if  youll strike off these chains, Ill spell you at those oars."
85,Cleos,Genna,"Youll wear your chains,  Kingslayer.You figure to row all the way to Kings Landing, wench?You will call me Brienne.Not wench.My name is Ser Jaime.Not Kingslayer.Do you deny that you slew a king?No."
86,Cleos,Genna,"If so, unlace those breeches and show me."
87,Cleos,Genna,"Id ask you to open your bodice, but from the look of you that wouldnt prove much."
88,Cleos,Genna,"Cousin, remember your courtesies."
89,Gendry,Hot,
90,Catelyn,Jaime,"Refuse, and I  will have your  blood."
91,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Perhaps she is not so stupid after all,"
92,Catelyn,Tyrion,I am not stupid.Nor deaf.
93,Jaime,Tyrion,"I was  speaking to myself, and not of you.Its an easy habit to slip into in a cell."
94,Jaime,Tyrion,"By your speech, Id judge you nobly born.My father is Selwyn of Tarth, by the grace of the gods Lord of Evenfall."
95,Jaime,Tyrion,"Tarth,A ghastly large rock in the narrow sea, as I recall."
96,Jaime,Tyrion,How is it that you serve Robb of Winterfell? It is Lady Catelyn I serve.
97,Jaime,Tyrion,"Be silent.Ive had a bellyful.of silence, woman.Talk with Ser Cleos then.I have no words for monsters."
98,Jaime,Tyrion,Are there monsters hereabouts?
99,Cersei,Jaime,"And me without my sword!A man who would violate his own sister, murder his king, and fling an innocent child to his death  deserves no other name."
100,Jaime,Tyrion,"You will be courteous as concerns  Cersei, wench,My name is Brienne, not wench.What do you care what a monster calls you?My name is Brienne,Lady Brienne?"
101,Cleos,Jaime,Or would Ser Brienne be more to your taste?
102,Cleos,Jaime,"No, I fear not.You can trick  out a milk cow in crupper, crinet, and charnfron, and bard her all in silk, but that doesnt mean you can  ride her into battle.Cousin Jaime, please, you ought not speak so roughly."
103,Cleos,Jaime,"We have far to go, we  should not quarrel amongst ourselves.When I quarrel I do it with a sword, coz."
104,Cleos,Jaime,"Perhaps they do not know what real women look like,  living on a dreary mountain in the sea.Tarth is beautiful, The Sapphire Isle, its called.Be quiet,  monster, unless you mean to make me gag you.Shes rude as well, isnt she, coz?"
105,Cleos,Jaime,"Though she has steel in her spine, Ill grant  you.Not many men dare name me monster to my face."
106,Cleos,Jaime,"Lady Brienne had those lies from Catelyn Stark, no doubt.The Starks  cannot hope to defeat you with swords, ser, so now they make war with poisoned words."
107,Cleos,Jaime,Any man whod believe that a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard would  harm a child does not know the meaning of honor.
108,Brandon,Cersei,"He was seven, Jaime,Even if he understood what he saw, we should have been able to frighten him into silence.I didnt think youd want -    "
109,Brandon,Cersei,"if he wakes well say he was dreaming, well call him a liar, and  should worse come to worst Ill kill Eddard Stark.And then what do you imagine Robert will do?Let Robert do as he pleases."
110,Brandon,Cersei,"The War for Cerseis Cunt, the singers will  call it.Jaime, let go of me!"
111,Cleos,Jaime,"We could save a deal of traveling if you delivered me to my father instead of my brother,Lady Catelyns daughters are in Kings Landing.I will return with the girls or not at all."
112,Cleos,Jaime,"Cousin, lend me your knife.No."
113,Cleos,Jaime,I will not have you armed.
114,Cleos,Jaime,"Cleos, it seems I must ask you to shave me.Leave the beard, but take the  hair off my head.Youd be shaved bald?"
115,Cleos,Jaime,The realm knows Jaime Larmister as a beardless knight with long golden hair.
116,Cleos,Jaime,Id sooner not be recognized while Im in irons.
117,Bronn,Renly,
118,Cleos,Jaime,I learned to manage oars and sail before I ever sat a horse.
119,Cleos,Jaime,"Gods, my arms are sore.I hope the wind lasts."
120,Cleos,Jaime,I smell rain.
121,Cleos,Jaime,Smoke.
122,Brienne,Jaime,"This was not chivalrously done,No true knight would condone such wanton butchery.True knights see worse every time they ride to war, wench,And do worse, yes."
123,Brienne,Jaime,Ill leave no innocents to be food for crows.A heartless wench.
124,Brienne,Jaime,"Stay to the river and leave the dead alone, woman."
125,Cleos,Jaime,"One of us will need to cut them down,Ill climb."
126,Cleos,Jaime,Just get these chains off.
127,Cleos,Jaime,"They Lay With Lions,Oh, yes, woman, this was most unchivalrously done  ... but by your side, not mine.I wonder who they were, these women?Tavern wenches,This was an inn, I remember it now.Some men of my escort  spent the night here when we last returned to Riverrun."
128,Cersei,Tyrion,"The girls pleasured some of my lord fathers soldiers, it would seem."
129,Cersei,Jon,"Thats how they earned their traitors collars, with a kiss and a cup of ale."
130,Cleos,Jon,This is Bracken land.
131,Cleos,Jon,"My father burned his castle, I fear he loves us not.It might be Marq Pipers work,Or that wisp o the wood Beric Dondarrion, though  Id heard he kills only soldiers.Perhaps a band of Roose Boltons northmen?Bolton was defeated by my father on the Green Fork.But not broken,He came south again when Lord Tywin marched against the fords.The word at Riverrun was that hed taken Harrenhal from Ser Amory Lorch."
132,Cleos,Jaime,"Brienne,if Lord Bolton holds Harrenhal, both the Trident and the kingsroad are likely  watched."
133,Cleos,Jaime,"You are under my protection.Theyd  need to kill me.I shouldnt think that would trouble them.I am as good a fighter as you,I was one of King Renlys chosen seven.With his  own hands, he cloaked me with the striped silk of the Rainbow Guard.The Rainbow Guard?"
134,Cleos,Jaime,"A singer once said that all maids are fair in silk ...  but he never met you, did he?"
135,Cleos,Jaime,We have graves to dig.
136,Brienne,Cleos,"This is a deal of trouble to take for  whores,What are we supposed to dig with?"
137,Brienne,Jaime,To the boat.
138,Brienne,Jaime,Theres a sail.
139,Brienne,Jaime,"Ser Cleos, Ill need you to  row as well."
140,Brienne,Jaime,"Mud red and watery blue,"
141,Brienne,Jaime,"Faster, ser."
142,Jaime,Tyrion,"We can hope the  noble Tullys will stop to bury the dead whores, I suppose."
143,Brienne,Cleos,The Others take  them.
144,Brienne,Jaime,Row!
145,Brienne,Jaime,"That is a river galley coming after us,"
146,Cleos,Jaime,Nine oars on each side  which means eighteen men.
147,Cleos,Jaime,We cannot outrun her.
148,Cleos,Jaime,"Eighteen, you said?Six for each of us.Id want eight, but these bracelets hinder me somewhat."
149,Cleos,Jaime,Unless the Lady Brienne would be so kind as to unshackle me?
150,Cleos,Jaime,"We had half a nights start on them,Theyve been rowing since dawn, resting two oars at a  time."
151,Cleos,Jaime,We ought to be able to kill a good many of them.
152,Cleos,Jaime,But ... there are eighteen.At the least.More likely twenty or twenty-five.
153,Cleos,Jaime,We cant hope to defeat eighteen.Did I say we could?The best we can hope for is to die with swords in our hands.
154,Brienne,Jaime,"You are under my protection,"
155,Brienne,Jaime,"Then protect me, wench.Or free me to protect myself."
156,Jaime,Robin,"Come to wish me godspeed, Ser Robin?Come to take you back, Kingslayer,How is it that youve lost your  golden hair?I hope to blind my enemies with the sheen off my head.Its worked well enough for you."
157,Cleos,Jaime,"Throw your  oars and your weapons into the river, and no one need be harmed."
158,Cleos,Jaime,"Jaime, tell him we were freed by Lady Catelyn ... an exchange of captives,  lawful."
159,Cleos,Jaime,. 
160,Jaime,Robin,"Catelyn Stark does not rule in Riverrun,"
161,Jaime,Robin,"Cast  your swords into the water.I have no sword,but if I did, Id stick it through your belly and hack the balls off those  four cravens."
162,Cleos,Jaime,"Ser Cleos, take the tiller,Kingslayer, take an oar and keep us off the rocks.As my lady commands."
163,Cleos,Jaime,"Ignore the wench,Steer."
164,Jaime,Robin,"Ser Robin,hear  me for a moment."
165,Jaime,Robin,"Say what you will, Kingslayer, but say it  quickly.I know a better way to settle this -  single combat.You and II was not born this morning, Lannister.No, but youre like to die this afternoon."
166,Jaime,Robin,"Ill fight you in chains.What could you fear?Not you, ser."
167,Jaime,Small,Bowmen.
168,Jaime,Small,Notch.
169,Catelyn,Jaime,"Youre a bloody stupid  wench,We could have sailed on without you.I suppose you expect me to thank you?I want none of your thanks, Kingslayer.I swore an oath to bring you safe to Kings Landing.And you actually mean to keep it?"
170,Catelyn,Desmond,Now theres a wonder.
171,Catelyn,Desmond,"Your sons,Maester Vyman told us."
172,Desmond,Utherydes,   said Utherydes Wayn.
173,Desmond,Utherydes,". The news must have driven you mad,a madness of grief, a mothers madness,  men will understand.You did not know...I did,I understood what I was doing and knew it was treasonous."
174,Desmond,Jaime,"Put me in the Kingslayers empty irons, and I will wear them  proudly, if that is how it must be.Fetters?"
175,Desmond,Edmure,"For the kings mother, my lords own  daughter?Impossible.Mayhaps,my lady would consent to be confined to her chambers  until Ser Edmure returns. Ser Desmond said."
176,Desmond,Edmure,Very well.
177,Catelyn,Desmond,"Visit the sept as you need, but elsewise remain in Lord Hosters chambers until  Lord Edmure returns.As you wish."
178,Catelyn,Desmond,"Set a  guard on me if you must, but I give you my pledge that I shall attempt no escape."
179,Catelyn,Utherydes,"It was a grave thing you did, my lady, but for  naught.Ser Desmond has sent Ser Robin Ryger after them, to bring back the Kingslayer ... or failing that,  his head."
180,Eddard,Hoster,"It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child,"
181,Catelyn,Hoster,"Tansy,"
182,Lysa,Tansy,"Its Catelyn,Its Cat, Father.Forgive me ... the blood ... oh, please ... Tansy ."
183,Catelyn,Hoster,"Who is  Tansy, my lord?"
184,Catelyn,Hoster,Does she still  live?
185,Catelyn,Hoster,Dead.
186,Catelyn,Hoster,"Youll have others ... sweet babes, and  trueborn."
187,Lysa,Tansy,.
188,Hoster,Vyman,aaahhh.
189,Catelyn,Hoster,"He was asking after a woman,Tansy.Tansy?"
190,Catelyn,Hoster,You know no one by that name?
191,Catelyn,Utherydes,Perhaps someone  from years past?
192,Catelyn,Utherydes,"No, my lady."
193,Tansy,Utherydes,The smallfolk often name their daughters after flowers and  herbs.
194,Catelyn,Tansy,"There was a widow, I recall, she used to come to the castle  looking for old shoes in need of new soles."
195,Catelyn,Tansy,"   said Catelyn, who remembered the old woman very well."
196,Catelyn,Desmond,"My pardons, Lady Catelyn, but I may not stay.Ser  Desmond has decreed that we are to speak to you only so far as our duties require.Then you must do as he commands."
197,Catelyn,Edmure,"I spoke to Utherydes Wayn, my lady.He is quite  certain that no woman by the name of Tansy has ever been at Riverrun during his service.There was a raven today, I saw.Has Jaime been taken again?"
198,Edmure,Robb,"No, my lady, weve had no word of the Kingslayer.Is it another battle, then?"
199,Robb,Vyman,"Please, be kind, put my fears at rest.My lady, I should not...Lord Tywin has left the riverlands.Alls quiet on the fords.Whence came the raven, then?From the west,Was it news of Robb?"
200,Hoster,Robb,"Yes, my lady.Something is wrong."
201,Hoster,Robb,Tell me.
202,Hoster,Robb,Is he hurt?
203,Robb,Vyman,"His Grace took a wound storming the Crag,but writes that it is no  cause for concern, and that he hopes to return soon.A wound?"
204,Robb,Vyman,"How serious?No cause for concern, he writes.All wounds concern me.Is he being cared for?I am certain of it.The maester at the Crag will tend to him, I have no doubt.Where was he wounded?My lady, I am commanded not to speak with you.I am sorry."
205,Catelyn,Hoster,"Forgive me,Tansy ... blood ... the blood ... gods be kind..."
206,Eddard,Lysa,Your son will be  heir to Winterfell and mine to the Eyrie.
207,Eddard,Robert,"Theyll be more brothers than cousins, truly, I just know it."
208,Catelyn,Small,"Father,Father, I know what you did."
209,Jon,Small,"You made him take her,Lysa was the price Jon Arryn    had to pay for the swords and spears of House Tully."
210,Gregor,Tywin,"Edmure,"
211,Gregor,Tywin,Have the Lannisters  crossed the river?I threw them back.
212,Edmure,Stannis,. 
213,Edmure,Stannis,"Stannis?What of Stannis?He lost the battle at Kings Landing,His fleet was burned, his army routed."
214,Joffrey,Renly,Stannis was no more a friend than Lord Tywin.You do not understand.
215,Joffrey,Robb,All the south.
216,Joffrey,Robb,And you see fit to loose the Kingslayer.You had no right.I had a mothers right.
217,Edmure,Robb,"No right,He was Robbs captive, your kings captive, and Robb charged me to  keep him safe.Brienne will keep him safe.She swore it on her sword.That woman?She will deliver Jaime to Kings Landing, and bring Arya and Sansa back to us safely.Cersei will never give them up.Not Cersei."
218,Edmure,Tyrion,And the Kingslayer swore it as well.Jaimes word is worthless.
219,Jaime,Tyrion,"Hell be  dead before your Brienne reaches Kings Landing, if she ever does.Dead?"
220,Edmure,Jaime,"Jaime was my charge, and I mean to have him back.Ravens to whom? he said, By river or road, the way from  Riverrun to Kings Landing must needs take them close by Harrenhal.Harrenhal."
221,Brienne,Catelyn,"Edmure, do you know what you have done?Have no fear, I left your part out.I wrote that Jaime had escaped, and offered a thousand dragons for  his recapture."
222,Brienne,Catelyn,"If this was an escape,and not an exchange of hostages, why should the    Lannisters give my daughters to Brienne?It will never come to that.The Kingslayer will be returned to us, I have made certain of it.All you have made certain is that I shall never see my daughters again."
223,Brienne,Catelyn,. 
224,Brienne,Catelyn,"Leave me, Edmure."
225,Brienne,Catelyn,"Leave me to Father and my grief, I have no more to say to you."
226,Brienne,Catelyn,Go.
227,Arya,Gendry,"Back  off,Slow, so you dont spook him."
228,Arya,Gendry,Do you know where were going?
229,Arya,Gendry,"North,"
230,Arya,Hot,Which way is north?
231,Arya,Hot,That way.But theres no sun.How do you know?From the moss.
232,Arya,Gendry,Thats south.What do we want with the north?
233,Arya,Gendry,The Trident.
234,Arya,Hot,"See?Once we reach the Trident, all we  need to do is follow it upstream till we come to Riverrun, here."
235,Arya,Hot,"Its a long  way, but we cant get lost so long as we keep to the river."
236,Arya,Hot,Which one is Riverrun?
237,Hot,Robb,There.
238,Hot,Robb,"Riverrun, it reads.You can read writing?"
239,Hot,Robb,Well be safe once we reach Riverrun.We will?Why?
240,Hot,Robb,We just will.But only if we get there.
241,Arya,Hot,"Ahooooooooo, ahooooooooo."
242,Arya,Gendry,Im so tired Im going to fall off the horse.
243,Arya,Gendry,"If he falls off, who do you think will find him first, the wolves or the  Mummers?The wolves,Better noses."
244,Arya,Hot,The Trident!
245,Arya,Hot,Were almost there!
246,Arya,Hot,I dont think this is the Trident.
247,Gendry,Hot,"Its too  little to be the Trident,and we didnt come far enough.Yes we did,We rode all day, and hardly stopped at all.We must have come a long  way.Lets have a look at that map again,"
248,Arya,Harren,"Were someplace here, I think,But,"
249,Harren,Hot,"And we rode all day!Theres miles and miles before we reach the Trident,We wont be there for days.This must  be some different river, one of these, see."
250,Gendry,Hot,"The Darry, the Greenapple, the  Maiden ... here, this one, the Little Willow, it might be that."
251,Gendry,Hot,It doesnt look so little to me.
252,Big,Gendry,"The one youre pointing at runs into that other one, see.The Big Willow,The Big Willow, then."
253,Arya,Willow,   Arya read.
254,Gendry,Hot,"No!Theyll kill us for sure.We have to know which river this is,We have to know.Well, we dont."
255,Gendry,Hot,"We wont go up or downstream,Well cross  and keep going north, like we were.Can horses swim?"
256,Gendry,Hot,"It looks deep, Arry.What if there are snakes? Are you sure were going north?"
257,Gendry,Hot,"All these hills ... if we got turned around...The moss on the trees -  He pointed to a nearby tree. said Arya, You can come or you can stay  here."
258,Arya,Hot,"It wasnt the Trident,It wasnt."
259,Arya,Hot,"Im cold and wet,Were a long way  from Harrenhal now, for sure.  "
260,Hot,Jon,Could we sleep at least?
261,Hot,Jon,"Im so tired, Arry, and my arse is sore.I think Ive got  blisters.Youll have more than that if youre caught,Weve got to keep going.Weve got to.But its almost dark, and you cant even see the moon.Get back on your horse."
262,Gendry,Hot,"You fell asleep,I was just resting my eyes.You were resting them a long while, then."
263,Gendry,Hot,You need to stop and sleep.I can keep going as long as you can.
264,Gendry,Hot,"Liar,You keep going if you want to be stupid, but Im stopping."
265,Gendry,Hot,You  sleep.What about Hot Pie?
266,Gendry,Tickler,"Ser Gregor,Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."
267,Chett,Tickler,. 
268,Maegor,Tyrion,Who?
269,Davos,Stannis,
270,Maegor,Tyrion,Who?
271,Mandon,Tyrion,"Cut  yourself shaving, did you?"
272,Bronn,Tyrion,"With a fearful big razor, yes."
273,Cersei,Tyrion,Where have you been?
274,Cersei,Tyrion,"I sent for you ... it must have been a fortnight ago.Four days ago, more like,and Ive been here twice, and found you dead to the  world.Not dead.Though my sweet sister did try."
275,Bronn,Mandon,Whats that  ugly thing on your chest?
276,Bronn,Mandon,My knightly sigil.
277,Bronn,Tyrion,See you dont forget it.
278,Tyrion,Tywin,"I was the  one who promised you knighthood, remember? by your lord fathers command"
279,Tyrion,Tywin,I lose half my nose and you gain a  knighthood.The gods have a deal to answer for.
280,Bronn,Tywin,Did my father dub you himself ?No.
281,Bronn,Tyrion,"Took half the bloody day, with only three of the White Swords left to do the  honors.I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."
282,Bronn,Tyrion,"Who else was lost?Sandor,Not dead, only gone.The gold cloaks say he turned craven and you led a  sortie in his place."
283,Bronn,Tyrion,My sister has mistaken me for a mushroom.
284,Bronn,Tyrion,"I sent him to bring Ser jacelyn and he came back and told me hes dead.Him, and thousands more."
285,Bronn,Tyrion,How?
286,Bronn,Tyrion,During the battle.
287,Cersei,Joffrey,"He didnt seem so  fearsome then, so they dragged him off his horse and killed him."
288,Cersei,Joffrey,"My nephew,Joffrey."
289,Cersei,Joffrey,"Mussed his hair, stubbed his toe, cracked a nail?Not as I heard.I warned Cersei what would happen.Who commands the gold cloaks now?Your lord fathers given them to one of his westermen, some knight named Addam Marbrand."
290,Shagga,Timett,"I sent Pod looking for Shagga, but hes had no luck.The Stone Crows are still in the kingswood."
291,Stannis,Tyrion,"Chella  turned up with a dozen Black Ears at the River Gate one morning, but your fathers red cloaks chased  them off while the Kingslanders threw dung and cheered."
292,Cersei,Tyrion,I want you to go to my sister.
293,Alayaya,Tyrion,"  Eight, nine days ago, after the whipping."
294,Alayaya,Tyrion,"Whipping?They tied her to a post in the yard and scourged her, then shoved her out the gate naked and bloody."
295,Cersei,Shae,"I  promised my sister I would treat Tornmen as she treated Alayaya,"
296,Bronn,Cersei,How can I scourge an eight-year-old boy?
297,Bronn,Cersei,"You dont have Tommen,Once she learned that Ironhand was dead, the queen  sent the Kettleblacks after him, and no one at Rosby had the balls to say them nay."
298,Bronn,Tommen,"The Kettleblacks were  supposed to be ours,They were, so long as I could give them two of your pennies for every one they had from the queen, but  now shes raised the stakes."
299,Osfryd,Osney,"Gods  know what for, no one saw them do any fighting."
300,Bronn,Tyrion,Is it true that Stannis was put to rout by  Renlys ghost?
301,Bronn,Tyrion,"From the winch towers, all we saw was banners in the mud and men throwing  down their spears to run, but theres hundreds in the pot shops and brothels wholl tell you how they saw  Lord Renly kill this one or that one.Most of Stanniss host had been Renlys to start, and they went right  back over at the sight of him in that shiny green armor."
302,Renly,Tyrion,"How did Stannis escape?His Lyseni kept their galleys out in the bay, beyond your chain."
303,Bronn,Renly,"Men were killing each other to get aboard,  toward the end.What of Robb Stark, what has he been doing?Theres some of his wolves burning their way down toward Duskendale."
304,Bronn,Tyrion,"its said hes a good soldier, and openhanded with the  plunder."
305,Bronn,Tyrion,No.
306,Bronn,Tyrion,"Youre the captain of the  Hands guard.Youre not the Hand,Your father is, and hes got his own bloody  guard.What happened to all the men you hired for me?Some died at the winch towers.That uncle of yours, Ser Kevan, he paid the rest of us and tossed us  out.How good of him,Does that mean youve lost your taste for gold?Not bloody likely.Good,because as it happens, I still have need of you."
307,Bronn,Tyrion,"I know hes bloody well drowned.I owe him a great debt, but how to pay it?"
308,Bronn,Mandon,"I know precious little  of the man, if truth be told.He had eyes like a fish and he wore a white cloak.What else do you need to know?Everything,for a start."
309,Bronn,Cersei,"Help me up,Its time I paid a call on my father, and past time I let myself be seen again.Such a pretty sight,Whats half a nose, on a face like mine?But speaking of pretty, is Margaery Tyrell in Kings Landing  yet?No."
310,Bronn,Tyrion,"Wife, widow, or whore, the women are all giving up their virtue to every peach-fuzz boy with  a gold rose on his teat."
311,Bronn,Tyrion,Pod!
312,Bronn,Tyrion,Podrick Payne!Where in the seven hells are you?
313,Bronn,Tyrion,"Pod, get in here!"
314,Bronn,Tyrion,My  lord.
315,Bronn,Tyrion,"Abed, I mean.I have stayed abed too long.Bring me some clean garb.Garb?"
316,Bronn,Tyrion,"Clothing,Tunic, doublet, breeches, hose."
317,Bronn,Tyrion,So I can leave this bloody cell.
318,Meryn,Tyrion,"Lower the bridge,The queens orders are to raise the bridge at night."
319,Cersei,Meryn,"The queens asleep, and I have business with my father."
320,Osmund,Tyrion,"Feeling stronger,  mlord?Much."
321,Osmund,Tyrion,I can scarcely wait.
322,Bronn,Podrick,"Tyrell men,Lord Rowans too, and Lord  Redwynes."
323,Joffrey,Podrick,"Will you be strong  enough to attend, my lord?Ravening weasels could not keep me away."
324,Addam,Cersei,"My lord,how good to see  you on your feet.Id heard - "
325,Addam,Cersei,"Shall I offer congratulations or condolences?Both, I fear."
326,Addam,Cersei,"Death and desertion have left me with some forty-four hundred.Only  the gods and Petyr know how we are to go on paying wages for so many, but your sister forbids  me to dismiss any."
327,Addam,Cersei,Do you come from my  father?
328,Addam,Cersei,Aye.
329,Addam,Cersei,"Lord Tywin feels forty-four hundred guardsmen  more than sufficient to find one lost squire, but your cousin Tyrek remains missing."
330,Bronn,Tyrion,"I couldnt find him either,Hes feeding worms,Ironhand looked for him, and the eunuch rattled a  nice fat purse."
331,Addam,Bronn,"Give it up, ser."
332,Addam,Tyrion,"Lord Tywin is stubborn where his blood is concerned.He will have the lad, alive or dead, and I mean to oblige him."
333,Addam,Tyrion,You will find  your father in his solar.
334,Addam,Tyrion,I believe I know the way.
335,Tyrion,Tywin,Tyrion.
336,Podrick,Tyrion,"Im pleased you remember me, my lord."
337,Bronn,Podrick,"Ser Bronn,Podrick."
338,Tyrion,Tywin,"Thats a handsome chain,"
339,Tyrion,Tywin,You had best be seated.Is it wise for you to be out of your sickbed?I am sick of my sickbed.
340,Spare,Tyrion,"Such pleasant chambers you have.Would you believe it, while I was dying, someone moved me  to a dark little cell in Maegors?The Red Keep is overcrowded with wedding guests.Once they depart, we will find you more suitable  accommodations.I rather liked these accommodations.Have you set a date for this great wedding?Joffrey and Margaery shall marry on the first day of the new year, which as it happens is also the first  day of the new century.The ceremony will herald the dawn of a new era."
341,Spare,Tyrion,"Oh, bother, I fear Ive made other plans for that day.Did you come here just to complain of your bedchamber and make your lame japes?I have important  letters to finish.Important letters.To be sure.Some battles are won with swords and spears, others with quills and ravens."
342,Spare,Tyrion,"I visited your sickbed as often as Maester Ballabar would allow it, when you seemed  like to die."
343,Cersei,Tyrion,Why did you dismiss Ballabar?
344,Cersei,Tyrion,Maester Frenken is not so determined to keep me insensate.Ballabar came to the city in Lord Redwynes retinue.
345,Cersei,Tywin,She feared for your life.
346,Cersei,Tywin,"Doubtless thats why shes never once left my bedside.Dont be impertinent.Cersei has a royal wedding to plan, I am waging a war, and you have been out of  danger for at least a fortnight."
347,Podrick,Tywin,"Though the wound is ghastly enough, Ill grant you.What madness possessed you?The foe was at the gates with a battering ram.If Jaime had led the sortie, youd call it valor.Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove his helm in battle.I trust you killed the man who cut  you?Oh, the wretch is dead enough."
348,Mandon,Tyrion,"A dead  enemy is a joy forever,"
349,Stannis,Tywin,"Why are you here in the city, Father?"
350,Stannis,Tywin,Shouldnt you be off fighting Lord Stannis or Robb  Stark or someone?
351,Stannis,Tywin,"Until Lord Redwyne brings his fleet up, we lack the ships to assail Dragonstone."
352,Gregor,Helman,"Tallhart and  Glover will be caught between them, with a third of Starks strength.Duskendale?"
353,Gregor,Helman,Its nothing you need trouble yourself with.
354,Gregor,Tyrion,Say what you want and take yourself back to bed.What I want .
355,Gregor,Tyrion,. 
356,Tyrion,Tywin,"Pod tells me that Petyrs been made Lord of Harrenhal.An empty title, so long as Roose Bolton holds the castle for Robb Stark, yet Lord Baelish was desirous  of the honor."
357,Tyrion,Tywin,A Lannister pays his debts.
358,Tyrion,Tywin,"That title may not be as empty as you think,Petyr does nothing without  good reason."
359,Aerys,Tywin,"You said something about paying debts, I believe? And you want your own reward, is that it?"
360,Aerys,Tywin,"Lands, castle,  some office?A little bloody gratitude would make a nice start."
361,Aerys,Tywin,Mummers and monkeys require applause.
362,Aerys,Tyrion,No one denies  the part you played.The part I played?
363,Aerys,Tyrion,"I saved your bloody city, it  seems to me.Most people seem to feel that it was my attack on Lord Stanniss flank that turned the tide of battle.Lords Tyrell, Rowan, Redwyne, and Tarly fought nobly as well, and Im told it was your sister Cersei  who  set the pyromancers to making the wildfire that destroyed the Baratheon fleet.While all I did was get my nosehairs trimmed, is that it?"
364,Myrcella,Tyrion,"Your chain was a clever stroke, and crucial to our victory."
365,Trystane,Tyrion,"I mislike giving House Martell a hostage, but I  suppose that could not be helped.Well have our own hostage,A council seat was also part of the bargain.Unless Prince  Doran brings an army when he comes to claim it, hell be putting himself in our power.Would that a council seat were all Martell came to claim,You promised him  vengeance as well.I promised him justice.Call it what you will.It still comes down to blood.Not an item in short supply, surely?I splashed through lakes of it during the battle."
366,Timett,Tyrion,"Or have you grown so fond of Gregor Clegane that you  cannot bear to part with him?Ser Gregor has his uses, as did his brother.Every lord has need of a beast from time to time ... a lesson  you seem to have learned, judging from Ser Bronn and those clansmen of yours."
367,Bronn,Chella,"The woods are full of beasts,The alleyways as well.True."
368,Bronn,Tyrion,". You have important letters, yes."
369,Jaime,Tyrion,"What do I want, you ask?"
370,Jaime,Tywin,I want Casterly Rock.
371,Jaime,Tywin,"Your brothers birthright?The knights of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry, to father children, and to hold land, you know  that as well as I."
372,Jaime,Tywin,I want you to stand up before the realm and proclaim that  I am your son and your lawful heir.
373,Tyrion,Tywin,"Casterly Rock,Never."
374,Jaime,Tyrion,Why?
375,Jaime,Tyrion,You ask that?
376,Shae,Tyrion,But neither gods nor men shall ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock  into your whorehouse.My whorehouse?
377,Shae,Tyrion,Cersei told you about Alayaya.Is that her name?
378,Shae,Tywin,Who was the one you  married as a boy?Tysha.
379,Shae,Tywin,And that camp follower on the Green Fork?Why do you care?
380,Shae,Tywin,I dont.No more than I care if they live or die.It was you who had Yaya whipped.
381,Tyrion,Tywin,Your sister told me of your threats against my grandsons.
382,Tyrion,Tywin,Did  she lie?
383,Alayaya,Tyrion,"I made threats, yes."
384,Alayaya,Joffrey,"So the Kettleblacks would not  misuse her.To save a whores virtue, you threatened your own House, your own kin?Is that the way of it?You were the one who taught me that a good threat is often more telling than a blow."
385,Tommen,Tywin,"Hes a good lad, and mine own blood.As was your mother."
386,Tommen,Tywin,"Go back to your bed,  Tyrion, and speak to me no more of your rights to Casterly Rock."
387,Tommen,Tywin,"The next one I find in  your bed, Ill hang."
388,Davos,Stannis,"To remind me  of my kings justice,"
389,Davos,Stannis,"Mother, have mercy,Save me, gentle Mother, save us all.My luck is gone, and my sons."
390,Davos,Stannis,"The fire took it all ... the fire...You called the fire,You burned us ... burned us ... burrrmed usssssss.It was her!"
391,Davos,Stannis,"Mother, dont forsake us.It was her who burned you, the red woman,  Melisandre, her!"
392,Davos,Melisandre,"It was her work,"
393,Chett,Davos,"Ship,Ship, here, here!"
394,Chett,Davos,"Ship,help me, HELP ME!"
395,Davos,Joffrey,"You,you  up on the rock."
396,Joffrey,Salladhor,"I was in the battle.I was ... a captain, a ... a knight, I was a knight.Aye, ser,and serving which king?"
397,Sansa,Stannis,"Stannis,Gods be good, I serve King Stannis.Aye,and so do we."
398,Loras,Sansa,"Ser Loras,you ... you look so lovely."
399,Loras,Sansa,My lady is too kind.
400,Loras,Sansa,"My sister awaits you eagerly.I have so looked forward to our supper.As has Margaery, and my lady grandmother as well."
401,Loras,Sansa,Your grandmother?
402,Loras,Sansa,"Lady Olenna.She is to sup with you as well.Oh,"
403,Loras,Sansa,"The  Queen of Thorns, shes called.Isnt that right?It is."
404,Loras,Sansa,"Youd best not use that  name in her presence, though, or youre like to get pricked."
405,Cersei,Sansa,the  Queen of Thorns.
406,Loras,Sansa,Is that  your brother?
407,Loras,Sansa,"It is, my lady,Garlan often trains against three men,  or even four.In battle it is seldom one against one, he says, so he likes to be prepared.He must be very brave.He is a great knight,A better sword than me, in truth, though Im the better lance.I remember,You ride wonderfully, ser.My lady is gracious to say so.When has she seen me ride?At the Hands tourney, dont you remember?"
408,Loras,Sansa,You threw white roses to the other girls that  day.
409,Loras,Sansa,You said no victory was half as beautiful as me.
410,Loras,Sansa,"I spoke only a simple truth, that any man with eyes could see."
411,Renly,Sansa,"It was after you unhorsed Ser Robar Royce,"
412,Renly,Sansa,"I slew Robar at Storms End, my lady."
413,Loras,Sansa,"That was when Lord Renly was killed, wasnt it?How  terrible for your poor sister.For Margaery?"
414,Loras,Sansa,To be sure.
415,Loras,Robar,"She did not see.Even so, when she heard..."
416,Loras,Robar,Renly is dead.
417,Loras,Robar,What use to speak of them?
418,Loras,Robar,"I ... my lord, I ...I did not mean to give offense, ser.Nor could you, Lady Sansa,"
419,Loras,Sansa,Who are they?
420,Loras,Sansa,"My grandmothers personal guard,Their mother named them Erryk and Arryk, but  Grandmother cant tell them apart, so she calls them Left and Right.,,    Left and Right opened the doors, and Margaery Tyrell herself emerged and swept down the short flight  of steps to greet them.Lady Sansa,Im so pleased you came."
421,Loras,Sansa,"You do me great honor, Your Grace.Wont you call me Margaery?"
422,Loras,Sansa,Might I call you  Sansa?If it please you.
423,Margaery,Sansa,"Come, my grandmother  awaits, and she is not the most patient of ladies."
424,Garlan,Margaery,Merry
425,Margaery,Olenna,"I am honored to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna, widow to the late Luthor Tyrell, Lord  of Highgarden, whose memory is a comfort to us all."
426,Olenna,Sansa,"Kiss me, child,It is so kind of you to sup with me and my foolish flock of hens."
427,Hoster,Sansa,"It is kind of you to have me, my lady.I knew your grandfather, Lord Rickard, though not well.He died before I was born.I am aware of that, child."
428,Margaery,Sansa,We are sorry  for your losses.
429,Margaery,Sansa,"I was saddened when I heard of Lord Renlys death, Your Grace.He was  very gallant.You are kind to say so,"
430,Margaery,Sansa,"Gallant, yes, and charming, and very clean."
431,Alerie,Margaery,"It comes from their Targaryen  blood, I should think."
432,Alerie,Margaery,"They tried to marry me to a Targaryen once, but I soon put an end to  that.Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother,Father liked him as well, and so did  Loras.Loras is young,"
433,Alerie,Margaery,"As to your father, would that Id been born a peasant woman with a big  wooden spoon, I might have been able to beat some sense into his fat head.Mother,Hush, Alerie, dont take that tone with me."
434,Alerie,Sansa,"Im only to blame for your husband, the lord oaf of Highgarden.Grandmother,mind your words, or what will Sansa think of us? She might think we have some wits about us.One of us, at any rate."
435,Alerie,Sansa,"Its treason, I warned them, Robert has two sons, and Renly has an older brother, how can he  possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?"
436,Mace,Renly,"Margaery, youre clever, be a dear and tell your poor old  half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own  size when you poke it.They call them puff fish, Grandmother.Of course they do."
437,Renly,Sansa,"And what do you say to that, Sansa?"
438,Garth,Sansa,"The Tyrells can trace their  descent back to Garth Greenhand,"
439,Garth,Sansa,"So can the Florents, the Rowans, the oakhearts, and half the other noble  houses of the south."
440,Garth,Sansa,"I shouldnt wonder that more  than his hands were green.Sansa,you must be very hungry. Sansa admitted. declared Lady Olenna, who obviously had no intention of being hushed."
441,Alerie,Sansa,I hope that youre fond of fools.
442,Alerie,Sansa,"I think ... fools, my lady?You mean ... the sort in motley?Feathers, in this case."
443,Butterbumps,Sansa,Sansa must think that my granddaughter is attended by a flock of sheep.
444,Butterbumps,Sansa,"Break it, my lady,"
445,Butterbumps,Sansa,Catch them!
446,Olenna,Sansa,"Do you know my son, Sansa?Lord Puff  Fish of Highgarden?A great lord,A great oaf,His father was an oaf as well."
447,Butterbumps,Sansa,"And now my oaf son is doing the same, only hes riding a lion instead of a palfrey."
448,Alerie,Sansa,All these kings  would do a deal better if they would put down their swords and listen to their mothers.
449,Olenna,Sansa,"I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy,This Joffrey."
450,Olenna,Sansa,I...
451,Olenna,Sansa,  
452,Butterbumps,Sansa,Has this boy mistreated you?
453,Dontos,Olenna,Why are you gaping at Butterbumps?
454,Dontos,Olenna,"Have the Lannisters stolen your tongue, child?"
455,Dontos,Sansa,"Joffrey ... King Joffrey, hes ... His  Grace is very fair and handsome, and ... and as brave as a lion.Yes, all the Lannisters are lions, and when a Tyrell breaks wind it smells just like a rose,But how kind is he?"
456,Butterbumps,Sansa,"Will he cherish Margaery and treat her tenderly, protect her honor as he would his  own?He will,He is very ... very comely.You said that."
457,Margaery,Sansa,"The question  is, what is Joffrey?"
458,Margaery,Sansa,"I am not fond of leeks.Take this broth  away, and bring me some cheese.The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.The cheese will be served when I want it served, and I want it served now."
459,Margaery,Sansa,"Are you frightened, child?"
460,Margaery,Sansa,"Tell me the truth,  no harm will come to you.My father always told the truth."
461,Margaery,Sansa,"Lord Eddard, yes, he had that reputation, but they named him traitor and took his head off even so."
462,Margaery,Sansa,"Joffrey,Joffrey did that."
463,Sansa,Tyrion,
464,Joffrey,Margaery,Go on.
465,Joffrey,Sansa,I cant.
466,Butterbumps,Ilyn,"I never meant ... my father was a traitor, my brother as well, I have  the traitors blood, please, dont make me say more.Calm yourself, child,Shes terrified, Grandmother, just look at her."
467,Butterbumps,Ilyn,Fool!
468,Butterbumps,Ilyn,The Bear and  the Maiden Fair will do nicely.It will!
469,Butterbumps,Ilyn,"It will do nicely indeed!Shall I sing it standing on my head, my lady?Will that make it sound better?No.Stand on your feet, then."
470,Butterbumps,Olenna,"As I recall, you never wash your hair.As my lady commands."
471,Olenna,Varys,"A bear there was, a bear, a BEAR!  Lady Olenna squirmed forward. Sansa said, "
472,Butterbumps,Varys,Sing louder!
473,Butterbumps,Varys,"These old ears are almost deaf, you know."
474,Butterbumps,Varys,Sing!.
475,Butterbumps,Varys,THE BEAR!
476,Butterbumps,Sansa,"OH, COME,  THEY SAID, OH COME TO THE FAIR!"
477,Butterbumps,Sansa,"ALL BLACK  AND BROWN, AND COVERED WITH HAIR!"
478,Butterbumps,Sansa,"At Highgarden we have many spiders amongst the flowers.So long as  they keep to themselves we let them spin their little webs, but if they get underfoot we step on them."
479,Butterbumps,Sansa,"Now, child, the truth.What sort of man is this Joffrey, who calls  himself Baratheon but looks so very Lannister? AND DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE TO THERE."
480,Margaery,Sansa,"THREE  BOYS, A GOAT, AND A DANCING BEAR!"
481,Margaery,Olenna,"A monster,Joffrey is a monster."
482,Olenna,Sansa,And the  queen as well.
483,Margaery,Sansa,",Ahthats a pity."
484,Joffrey,Margaery,"Please,"
485,Joffrey,Margaery,". Have no fear, Lord Puff Fish is determined that Margaery shall be queen."
486,Butterbumps,Margaery,"Even so, we thank you for the  truth, child.."
487,Butterbumps,Margaery,THE FAIR!
488,Butterbumps,Margaery,"Sansa, would you like to visit Highgarden?"
489,Loras,Margaery,"All the autumn flowers are in bloom just now, and there are groves and fountains, shady  courtyards, marble colonnades."
490,Margaery,Sansa,"Do you hawk, Sansa?A little,OH, SWEET SHE WAS, AND PURE, AND FAIR!THE MAID WITH HONEY IN HER HAIR!You will love Highgarden as I do, I know it."
491,Margaery,Sansa,"Once you see it, youll never want to leave.And perhaps you wont have to.HER HAIR!"
492,Margaery,Sansa,"THE MAID WITH HONEY IN HER HAIR!Shush, child,Sansa hasnt even told us that she would like to come  for a visit.Oh, but I would,"
493,Joffrey,Sansa,... SMELLED THE SCENT ON THE SUMMER AIR.
494,Joffrey,Sansa,"ALL BLACK  AND BROWN AND COVERED WITH HAIR.But the queen,she wont let me go..."
495,Joffrey,Sansa,"If my son  the lord oaf asks, she will have no choice but to grant his request.Will he?"
496,Olenna,Sansa,Will he ask?
497,Olenna,Sansa,"I see no need to give him a choice.Of course, he has no hint of our true  purpose.HE SMELLED THE SCENT ON THE SUMMER AIR!"
498,Loras,Sansa,"Our true purpose, my lady?HE SNIFFED AND ROARED AND SMELLED IT THERE!HONEY ON THE SUMMER AIR!To see you safely wed, child,to  my grandson."
499,Loras,Margaery,"OH, IMA MAID, AND IM PURE AND FAIR!"
500,Loras,Margaery,"ILL NEVER DANCE WITH A HAIRY BEAR!Would you like that, Sansa?"
501,Loras,Margaery,"Ive never had a sister, only brothers.Oh, please say  yes, please say that you will consent to marry my brother."
502,Loras,Margaery,Yes.
503,Loras,Olenna,  
504,Loras,Olenna,"Dont be foolish, child."
505,Loras,Sansa,"Not the least bit oaflsh, and heir to Highgarden besides."
506,Loras,Willas,","
507,Margaery,Willas,I do not know Ser Willas.
508,Margaery,Willas,Is he  ... is he as great a knight as his brothers?...
509,Margaery,Willas,"THE BEAR!No,He has never taken vows."
510,Margaery,Sansa,"Tell the girl the truth.The poor lad is crippled, and thats the way of it.He was hurt as a squire, riding in his first tourney,His horse fell and crushed his  leg.That snake of a Domishman was to blame, that Oberyn Martell.And his maester as well.I CALLED FOR A KNIGHT, BUT YOURE A BEAR!"
511,Margaery,Sansa,"ALL BLACK AND  BROWN AND COVERED WITH HAIR!Willas has a bad leg but a good heart,He used to read to me when I was a little girl,  and draw me pictures of the stars.You will love him as much as we do, Sansa.SHE KICKED AND WAILED, THE MAID SO FAIR, BUT HE LICKED THE HONEY FROM  HER HAIR."
512,Margaery,Sansa,HE LICKED THE HONEY FROM HER HAIR!When might I meet him?
513,Margaery,Sansa,"Soon,When you come to Highgarden, after Joffrey and I are wed. My  grandmother will take you.I will,I will indeed.THEN SHE SIGHED AND SQUEALED AND KICKED THE AIR!"
514,Butterbumps,Sansa,"AND OFF THEY WENT, FROM HERE TO THERE, THE BEAR, THE  BEAR, AND THE MAIDEN FAIR."
515,Butterbumps,Sansa,"I thought that dreadful song would never end,But look, here comes my  cheese."
516,Ryk,Ygritte,"If the crow flies, Ill boil your bones as well,"
517,Jon,Ygritte,"You want to guard him?If you want us to do it, leave us be and well do it."
518,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Might be you fooled these others, crow, but dont  think youll be fooling Mance."
519,Jon,Ryk,"And when he does, Ill  make a cloak oyour wolf there, and open your soft boys belly and sew a weasel up inside."
520,Jon,Ryk,And where would you find a weasel in the snow?
521,Jon,Ygritte,"When Mance hears how you did for Halfhand, hell take you quick enough,Take me for what?"
522,Jon,Ygritte,For one o us.
523,Jon,Ygritte,"In your hearts you all want to fly free.And when Im free,will I be free to go?Sure you will."
524,Jon,Ygritte,"And well be free to kill you.Its  dangerous being free, but most come to like the taste o it."
525,Jon,Qhorin,Youll see.
526,Jon,Weeper,"The Lord o Bones,"
527,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Whos this, then?A crow come over,He was afraid Id take his bones as well as Halfhands."
528,Rattleshirt,Ryk,"He slew Qhorin Halfhand,Him and that wolf o his.And did for Orell too,The lads a warg, or close enough,His wolf took a piece o  Halfhands leg."
529,Jon,Weeper,Aye?
530,Jon,Weeper,"Bring him to Mance, might be hell keep him."
531,Jon,Ryk,"They dont much care for that beast o yours,Theyre dogs and hes a wolf,They know hes not their kind."
532,Mance,Qhorin,"Some power,"
533,Rattleshirt,Ygritte,"Well make camp  here,Feed the horses, then the dogs, then yourself."
534,Mance,Ygritte,Well gut him after.
535,Jon,Rattleshirt,"That beast stays here.Ghost, stay,"
536,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Longspear, watch the beast."
537,Rattleshirt,Ygritte,"Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishmans taken my life,  But what does it matter, for all men must die, and Ive tasted the Dornishmans wife!The Dornishmans WifeWhats this?"
538,Jon,Ygritte,"A crow?The black bastard what gutted Orell,and a bloody warg as well.You were to kill them all.This one come over,He slew Qhorin Halfhand with his own hand.This boy?"
539,Jon,Ygritte,"The Halfhand should have been mine.Do you  have a name, crow?Jon Snow, Your Grace."
540,Jon,Ygritte,Your Grace?
541,Jon,Ygritte,You see.He takes me for a  king.
542,Jon,Ygritte,"A blind boy, must be."
543,Jon,Mance,Har!
544,Jon,Mance,"Close your beak, crow.Spin yourself around, might be youd find who youre looking for."
545,Jon,Mance,"Im Mance Rayder,And you are Eddard  Starks bastard, the Snow of Winterfell. How ... how could  you know...Thats a tale for later,How did you like the song, lad? Well enough.Id heard it before.But what does it matter, for all men must die,"
546,Jon,Mance,Did you slay my old friend the  Halffiand?I did.
547,Jon,Mance,"The Shadow Tower will never again seem as fearsome,Qhorin  was my enemy."
548,Jon,Mance,Or curse  you?
549,Jon,Mance,"You ought to thank me for killing your enemy,and curse me for killing your friend.Har!"
550,Jon,Mance,Well answered!Agreed.
551,Jon,Mance,"If you would join us, youd best know us."
552,Mag,Styr,Magnar means lord in the Old Tongue.
553,Mance,Tormund,Our ferocious chicken-eater here is my loyal  Tormund.  Tormund rose to his feet.
554,Jon,Mance,As you wish.
555,Brea,Tormund,"And here also Tormund Thunderfist, Husband to Bears, the  Mead-king of Ruddy Hall, Speaker to Gods and Father of Hosts.That sounds more like me,Well met, Jon Snow.I am fond o wargs, as it happens,  though not o Starks.The good woman at the brazier,is Dalla."
556,Jarl,Tormund,"Treat her like you would any queen, she is carrying my child."
557,Jarl,Tormund,"This beauty is  her sister Val.Young Jarl beside her is her latest pet.I am no mans pet,And Vals no man,You ought to have noticed that by now, lad.So there you have us, Jon Snow,The Kingbeyond-the-Wall and his court, such  as it is."
558,Jon,Mance,"Where did you come from?Winterfell,by way of Castle Black.And what brings you up the Milkwater, so far from the fires of home?"
559,Jon,Rattleshirt,How many were they?Five.
560,Jon,Rattleshirt,Tother went up a mountainside where no horse could follow.
561,Jon,Rattleshirt,Was it only the five of you?or are more of your brothers skulking  about?We were four and the Halfhand.Qhorin was worth twenty common men.
562,Jon,Styr,Some thought so.
563,Jon,Styr,How did that come to be?
564,Mag,Styr,"The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning, so he took me  on his ranging."
565,Jon,Mag,"Ranging, you call it ... why would crows come ranging up the Skirling  Pass?The villages were deserted,It was as if all the free folk had vanished.Vanished, aye,And not just the free folk.Who told you where we were, Jon  Snow?"
566,Mance,Tormund,"It were Craster, or Im a blushing maid.I told you, Mance, that creature needs to be  shorter by a head."
567,Craster,Tormund,"Tormund, some day try thinking before you speak."
568,Craster,Tormund,I asked Jon to see if he would tell it true.Har.
569,Jon,Tormund,"Well, I stepped in that!"
570,Jon,Tormund,"See, lad, thats why hes king and Im  not."
571,Mance,Rattleshirt,"He was raised a crow, you know, and the crows a tricksy bird.I would speak with the lad alone, my Lord of Bones,Leave us, all  of you.What, me as well?"
572,Mance,Tormund,"No, you especially,I eat in no hall where Im not welcome."
573,Mance,Tormund,"Me and the hens are leaving.Har,"
574,Dalla,Mance,"Sit, if you like,Are you hungry?Tormund left us two birds at    least.I would be pleased to eat, Your Grace.And thank you.Your Grace?"
575,Jon,Mance,Thats not a style one often hears from the lips of free folk.
576,Jon,Mance,"Will you take a horn of mead?Gladly,"
577,Jon,Mance,"Tormund spoke truly,The black crow is a  tricksy bird, thats so ... but I was a crow when you were no bigger than the babe in Dallas belly, Jon  Snow.So take care not to play tricksy with me.As you say, Your - Mance."
578,Jon,Mance,Your Mance!
579,Jon,Mance,Have you  puzzled it out yet?
580,Jon,Mance,Did Rattleshirt send word ahead?By wing?
581,Jon,Mance,Twice.
582,Jon,Robb,When you were a brother of  the Watch.
583,Jon,Robb,. Very good!
584,Jon,Robb,"It had snowed the  night before, and the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were waiting for someone  likely to pass underneath.I remember,You swore  not to tell.And kept my vow.That one, at least.We dumped the snow on Fat Tom.He was Fathers slowest guardsman."
585,Benjen,Jon,"But you said you saw me twice.When was the other time?When King Robert came to Winterfell to make your father Hand,"
586,Benjen,Jon,That cant be so.It was.
587,Benjen,Robert,"So I saddled my fleetest  horse, and rode.But,"
588,Benjen,Robert,".The Wall can stop an army, but not a man alone."
589,Jon,Robert,"Freeriders and hedge  knights are always attaching themselves to royal processions, in hopes of finding service with the king,  and my lute gained me easy acceptance."
590,Jon,Robert,"I know every bawdy song thats ever been made,  north or south of the Wall."
591,Jon,Ygritte,"I betook of your lord fathers meat and mead, had a look at Kingslayer and  Imp ... and made passing note of Lord Eddards children and the wolf pups that ran at their heels.Bael the Bard,Would that I were."
592,Jon,Ygritte,"More mead?No,if you had been discovered ... taken."
593,Jon,Ygritte,Your father would have had my head off.
594,Jon,Ygritte,"Though once I had eaten at his  board I was protected by guest right.The laws of hospitality are as old as the First Men, and sacred as a  heart tree."
595,Jon,Mance,"Here you are  the guest, and safe from harm at my hands ... this night, at least."
596,Jon,Mance,"Are you a  craven who turned your cloak from fear, or is there another reason that brings you to my tent?"
597,Jon,Mance,"Tell me why you  turned your cloak, and Ill tell you why I turned mine."
598,Dalla,Mance,"You will have heard stories of my desertion, I have no doubt.Some say it was for a crown."
599,Dalla,Mance,"Others that you had the wildling blood.The wildling blood is the blood of the First Men, the same blood that flows in the veins of the Starks.As to a crown, do you see one?I see a woman."
600,Dalla,Mance,My lady is blameless.
601,Jon,Mance,"You must  guess again, Jon Snow."
602,Jon,Mance,The Halfhand said you had a passion for wildling music.I did.
603,Jon,Mance,But not a hit.
604,Jon,Mance,"It was for this.A cloak?The black wool cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Nights Watch,One  day on a ranging we brought down a fine big elk."
605,Jon,Mance,"Here, here, and here?"
606,Jon,Mance,"It shredded my arm and back as well, and I bled worse than the  elk."
607,Denys,Jon,"It was the greatest treasure she had, and her gift to me."
608,Denys,Jon,"But at the Shadow Tower, I was given a new wool cloak from stores, black and black, and  trimmed with black, to go with my black breeches and black boots, my black doublet and black mail."
609,Denys,Jon,"I left the next morning ... for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak he  chose."
610,Joffrey,Jon,"And you, Jon Snow?"
611,Joffrey,Tommen,"You say you were at  Winterfell, the night my father feasted King Robert.I did say it, for I was.Then you saw us all."
612,Arya,Sansa,"You saw them walk the center aisle with every eye upon  them and take their seats at the table just below the dais where the king and queen were seated.I remember.And did you see where I was seated, Mance?"
613,Jon,Mance,Did you see where they put the  bastard?
614,Jon,Mance,"I think we had best find you a new cloak,"
615,Daenerys,Viserys,"You are blood of the  dragon,A dragon, not some smelly fish."
616,Groleo,Illyrio,"Would that this Balerion could soar as her namesake did, Your  Grace,Then we should not need to  row, nor tow, nor pray for wind.Just so, Captain,"
617,Daenerys,Groleo,their
618,Illyrio,Jorah,"I cannot see Drogon,Is he lost again?We are the ones who are lost, ser.Drogon has no taste for this wet creeping, no more than I do."
619,Daenerys,Jorah,How big will he grow?
620,Daenerys,Jorah,"Do you know?In the Seven Kingdoms, there are tales of dragons who grew so huge that they could pluck giant  krakens from the seas."
621,Daenerys,Jorah,"That would be a wondrous sight to see.It is only a tale, Khaleesi,They talk of wise old dragons living a thousand years  as well.Well, how long does a dragon live?"
622,Daenerys,Jorah,"A dragons natural span of days is many times as long as a mans, or so the songs  would have us believe ... but the dragons the Seven Kingdoms knew best were those of House  Targaryen."
623,Daenerys,Jorah,"It is no easy thing to slay a dragon, but it can  be done."
624,Arstan,Belwas,"A  dragon never stops growing, Your Grace, so long as he has food and freedom."
625,Daenerys,Jorah,Freedom?
626,Daenerys,Jorah,"What do you mean?In Kings Landing, your ancestors raised an immense domed castle for their dragons."
627,Daenerys,Jorah,"The maesters say it was because of the walls around them, and the great dome above  their heads.If walls could keep us small, peasants would all be tiny and kings as large as giants,Ive seen huge men born in hovels, and dwarfs who dwelt in castles.Men are men,Dragons are dragons."
628,Daenerys,Jorah,How profound.
629,Aerys,Daenerys,"What do you know of dragons, anyway?Little enough, thats true.Yet I served for a time in Kings Landing in the days when King Aerys sat the  Iron Throne, and walked beneath the dragonskulls that looked down from the walls of his throne room.Viserys talked of those skulls,The Usurper took them down and hid them away.He could  not bear them looking down on him upon his stolen throne."
630,Aerys,Daenerys,Did you  ever meet my royal father?
631,Aerys,Daenerys,"I had that great honor, Your Grace.Did you find him good and gentle?"
632,Daenerys,Jorah,His Grace was ...  often pleasant.Often?
633,Daenerys,Jorah,"But not always?He could be very harsh to those he thought his enemies.A wise man never makes an enemy of a king,Did you know my brother Rhaegar as well?It was said that no man ever knew Prince Rhaegar, truly.I had the privilege of seeing him in tourney,  though, and often heard him play his harp with its silver strings."
634,Jorah,Myles,"Along with a thousand others at some harvest feast.Next youll claim you squired  for him.I make no such claim, ser."
635,Daenerys,Viserys,"Young Lord Connington was dear to the prince as well, but his oldest friend was Arthur Dayne.The Sword of the Morning!"
636,Daenerys,Viserys,Viserys used to talk about his wondrous white  blade.He said Ser Arthur was the only knight in the realm who was our brothers peer.
637,Daenerys,Viserys,"It is not my place to question the words of Prince Viserys.King,He was a king, though he never reigned."
638,Daenerys,Viserys,But  what do you mean?
639,Daenerys,Viserys,"Ser Jorah named Rhaegar the  last dragon once.He had to have been a peerless warrior to be called that, surely? Your Grace,"
640,Jorah,Viserys,".Go on,You may speak freely to me.As you command."
641,Jorah,Viserys,"A warrior  without peer ... those are fine words, Your Grace, but words win no battles.Swords win battles,And Prince Rhaegar knew how to use one.He did, ser, but ..."
642,Arstan,Jorah,A change in the wind may bring the gift of victory.
643,Arstan,Jorah,Or  a ladys favor knotted round an arm.
644,Arstan,Jorah,"Be careful what you say, old man."
645,Daenerys,Jorah,"Be gentle, my knight."
646,Daenerys,Jorah,"Arstan had no wish to give  offense, Im certain.As you say, Khaleesi."
647,Daenerys,Viserys,I know little of Rhaegar.
648,Daenerys,Viserys,What was he truly like?
649,Daenerys,Viserys,Able.
650,Daenerys,Viserys,"There is a tale told of him ... but doubtless Ser Jorah knows it as well.I would hear it from you.As you wish,As a young boy, the Prince of Dragonstone was bookish to a fault."
651,Daenerys,Willem,It seems I must be a warrior.And he was!
652,Belwas,Daenerys,He was indeed.
653,Belwas,Daenerys,"My pardons, Your Grace."
654,Belwas,Daenerys,I must attend him.
655,Arstan,Daenerys,Strong Belwas is hungry!
656,Arstan,Daenerys,Strong Belwas  will eat now!
657,Arstan,Daenerys,"Whitebeard!You will bring food for Strong  Belwas!You may go,"
658,Daenerys,Jorah,"You would be wise to take that old  mans words well salted,A queen must listen to all,The highborn and the low, the strong and the weak, the  noble and the venal.One voice may speak you false, but in many there is always truth to be found."
659,Belwas,Daenerys,"Hear my voice then, Your Grace,This Arstan Whitebeard is playing you false.He is  too old to be a squire, and too well spoken to be serving that oaf of a eunuch."
660,Daenerys,Groleo,Wind!
661,Daenerys,Groleo,"The wind returns, the wind!"
662,Belwas,Daenerys,The gods are good!
663,Belwas,Daenerys,"You see, Jorah?We are on our way once more.Yes,but to what, my queen?"
664,Daenerys,Irri,"Even upon the sea,queens  take precedence over captains"
665,Daenerys,Jorah,"Come,"
666,Daenerys,Jorah,"Your Grace.I am sorry to disturb your sleep.I was not sleeping, ser.Come and watch."
667,Drogo,Jorah,"Drogon,dracarys."
668,Daenerys,Jorah,"Stop that, Rhaegal,You had the last one.Ill have no  greedy dragons."
669,Daenerys,Jorah,I wont need to char their meat over a brazier any longer.So I see.Dracarys?
670,Daenerys,Jorah,"Be careful with that word,  ser, or theyre like to singe your beard off."
671,Daenerys,Jhiqui,I wanted to choose a  command that no one was like to utter by chance.
672,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Your Grace,I wonder if I might have a few private words?Of course.Irri, leave us for a bit."
673,Irri,Jhiqui,"You as well, sweetling.Ser Jorah needs to talk to me.Yes, Khaleesi."
674,Arstan,Jorah,"Sit,  goodser, and tell mewhat is troublingyou.Three things."
675,Arstan,Jorah,Strong Belwas.
676,Arstan,Daenerys,"And Illyrio Mopatis, who sent  them."
677,Arstan,Daenerys,"And why is that?The warlocks in Qarth told you that you would be betrayed three times,IlOnce for blood and once for gold and once for love."
678,Arstan,Daenerys,Mirri Maz Duur  was the first.Which means two traitors yet remain ... and now these two appear.
679,Daenerys,Jorah,"Never  forget, Robert offered a lordship to the man who slays you."
680,Belwas,Jorah,"The Usurper is dead,But his son rules in his place."
681,Belwas,Jorah,A dutiful son  pays his fathers debts.Even blood debts.This boy Joffrey might want me dead ... if he recalls that Im alive.
682,Arstan,Belwas,Youve seen that.Aye.
683,Arstan,Drogo,"It might as easily have been your throat he crushed.Might have been, but was not,It was a stinging manticore meant to slay me.He  saved my life.Khaleesi, has it occurred to you that Whitebeard and Belwas might have been in league with the  assassin?It might all have been a ploy to win your trust."
684,Drogo,Mag,The  ploy worked well.
685,Illyrio,Mag,"These are Illyrios ships, Illyrios captains, Illyrios sailors ...  and Strong Belwas and Arstan are his men as well, not yours.Magister Illyrio has protected me in the past.Strong Belwas says that he wept when he heard my  brother was dead.Yes,but did he weep for Viserys, or for the plans he had made with him?His plans need not change."
686,Drogo,Illyrio,What does Illyrio Mopatis love more than gold?His skin.
687,Drogo,Illyrio,Mirri Maz Duur  betrayed me.I burned her for it.Mirri Maz Duur was in your power.
688,Daenerys,Jorah,  
689,Daenerys,Jorah,That wineseller who tried to poison you was a clever man as well.Clever men hatch  ambitious schemes.
690,Daenerys,Illyrio,"You will protect me.You, and my bloodriders.Four men?"
691,Daenerys,Illyrio,Take a  lesson from Pyat Free and Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
692,Daenerys,Illyrio,It seems to me that a queen who  trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone.
693,Daenerys,Illyrio,Am I to conquer  Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders?
694,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Your path is dangerous, I will not deny that.But if you blindly trust in every liar  and schemer who crosses it, you will end as your brothers did."
695,Daenerys,Illyrio,Strong  Belwas could not scheme his way to breakfast.And what lies has Arstan Whitebeard told me?He is not what he pretends to be.He speaks to you more boldly than any squire would dare.He spoke frankly at my command.He knew my brother.A great many men knew your brother.
696,Daenerys,Jorah,"I have a plan to put to YOU.What plan?Tell me.Illyrio Mopatis wants you back in Pentos, under his roof."
697,Daenerys,Jorah,Command  Groleo to change course for Slavers Bay.
698,Daenerys,Jorah,"What is there for me in  Slavers Bay?An army,If Strong Belwas is so much to your liking you can buy hundreds more like  him out of the fighting pits of Meereen ... but it is Astapor Id set my sails for.In Astapor you can buy  Unsullied.The slaves in the spiked bronze hats?"
699,Daenerys,Jorah,"Why should I want Unsullied?They dont even ride horses,  and most of them are fat.The Unsullied you may have seen in Pentos and Myr were household guards."
700,Arstan,Daenerys,Do you know the  tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor?No.
701,Daenerys,Drogo,"It was four hundred years ago or more, when the Dothraki first rode out of the east, sacking and  burning every town and city in their path."
702,Daenerys,Drogo,The Qohorik knew he was coming.
703,Chett,Drogo,By the time the Unsullied reached the city the sun had set.
704,Chett,Jacelyn,"But when dawn broke and Temmo and his bloodriders led their khalasar out of camp, they found three  thousand Unsullied drawn up before the gates with the Black Goat standard flying over their heads."
705,Chett,Jacelyn,The Dothraki charged.
706,Chett,Jacelyn,"Eighteen times the Dothraki charged, and broke themselves on those shields and spears like waves on a  rocky shore."
707,Chett,Daenerys,"Since that day, the city guard of Qohor has been made up solely of Unsullied, every one of whom  carries a tall spear from which hangs a braid of human hair.That is what you will find in Astapor, Your Grace."
708,Daenerys,Mag,"It will take longer, yes ... but when you break bread with Magister Illyrio, you will have a  thousand swords behind you, not just four."
709,Daenerys,Mag,How am I to buy a thousand slave soldiers?All I  have of value is the crown the Tourmaline Brotherhood gave me.Dragons will be as great a wonder in Astapor as they were in Qarth.
710,Illyrio,Mag,"Tiger  skins are costly.Those are Illyrios tiger skins,And Illyrio is a friend to House Targaryen.All the more reason not to steal his goods.What use are wealthy friends if they will not put their wealth at your disposal, my queen?"
711,Daenerys,Xaro,What better use for his tiger skins  than to buy you the beginnings of an army? 
712,Daenerys,Xaro,There will be dangers on such a long march.
713,Daenerys,Xaro,. There are dangers at sea as well.
714,Daenerys,Jorah,"A march will  have different dangers, my queen, but none greater.What if Captain Groleo refuses to change course, though?And Arstan, Strong Belwas, what will they  do?"
715,Daenerys,Jorah,"Perhaps its time you found that out.Yes,Ill do it!"
716,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ill see the  captain at once, command him to set course for Astapor."
717,Daenerys,Jorah,"Hand me my medallion belt,And my vest - "
718,Daenerys,Jorah,"Oh,"
719,Daenerys,Jorah,"You ... you should not have...I should not have waited so Iong, I should have kissed you in Qarth, in Vaes  Tolorru."
720,Daenerys,Jorah,"You were made to be  kissed, often and well."
721,Daenerys,Jorah,"I ... that was not fitting.I am  your queen.My queen,and the bravest, sweetest, and most beautiful woman I have ever seen.Daenerys  -   he conceded, "
722,Aegon,Bran,"The three-headed dragon of House Targaryen -  three dragons, and three riders.Yes,but my brothers are dead.Rhaenys and Visenya were Aegons wives as well as his sisters."
723,Aegon,Bran,"And I tell you truly, Daenerys, there is no man in all the world who will ever be half so  true to you as me."
724,Chett,Jacelyn,Hodor.
725,Chett,Hodor,"Hodor, hodor."
726,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor, hodor, hodor, hodor, hodor,"
727,Bran,Hodor,"NOP he shouted angrily.Hodor, leave off, Im here, Im here."
728,Bran,Hodor,Hodor?
729,Bran,Meera,Tumbledown TowerYou were gone too long.
730,Bran,Nan,little grandfather.
731,Bran,Meera,I wanted to eat.Meera will be back soon with supper.Im sick of frogs.I wanted to eat the deer.
732,Bran,Jojen,Did you mark the trees?
733,Bran,Jojen,"I forgot,You always forget."
734,Bran,Jojen,"I was a prince, Jojen,I was the prince of the woods.You are a prince,You remember, dont you?Tell me who you are.You knowI want you to say the words.Tell me who you are.Bran,"
735,Bran,Jojen,Brandon Stark.
736,Bran,Jojen,The Prince of Winterfell.
737,Bran,Jojen,And who is Summer?
738,Bran,Jojen,My direwolf.
739,Bran,Jojen,"Prince of the green.Bran the boy and Summer the wolf.You are two, then?Two,and one."
740,Bran,Jojen,"Remember that, Bran."
741,Bran,Jojen,"When you join, it is not  enough to run and hunt and howl in Summers skin."
742,Bran,Jojen,Will you remember?
743,Bran,Jojen,"Any tree, it doesnt matter, so long as you do it.I will."
744,Bran,Jojen,I wont forget this time.
745,Bran,Jojen,No.
746,Bran,Jojen,A warg cannot live on what his  beast consumes.
747,Hodor,Meera,HODOR!
748,Bran,Meera,"Hodor, hodor,"
749,Bran,Meera,Whos hungry?
750,Bran,Walder,"I am,"
751,Meera,Walder,"Well just have to feed you, then.Will you help me clean the catch, Bran? "
752,Bran,Meera,"Thank you, Meera,My lady.You are most welcome, Your Grace.Come the morrow,we had best move on."
753,Bran,Meera,"Have you had a green dream?No,Why leave, then?"
754,Bran,Meera,"Tumbledown Towers a good place for us.No villages near,  the woods are full of game, theres fish and frogs in the streams and lakes ... and who is ever going to find  us here?This is not the place we are meant to be.It is safe, though.It seems safe, I know,"
755,Bran,Jojen,   said Bran. Jojen reminded him.
756,Bran,Torrhen,"War everywhere, he said, each man against his  neighbor.We have plowed this field before,You want to make for the Wall, and your three-eyed  crow."
757,Hodor,Meera,"     said Jojen sharply,  said Meera."
758,Hodor,Meera,"The last thing we need is men hunting us.We could buy them,Trade for them.Look at us, Meera."
759,Bran,Jojen,"Alive, he becomes prey for those who want him dead  for good and true."
760,Bran,Jojen,"Somewhere to the north, the  three-eyed crow awaits us.Bran has need of a teacher wiser than me.How, Jojen?"
761,Bran,Jojen,"How?Afoot,A step at a time.The road from Greywater to Winterfell."
762,Jojen,Meera,How do we find him?Perhaps he will find us.
763,Bran,Jojen,Summer?
764,Bran,Jojen,No.
765,Bran,Jojen,Are you certain?
766,Bran,Jojen,Certain.
767,Jojen,Meera,"We should steal horses like Meera wants,and ride to the Umbers up at Last Hearth."
768,Jojen,Meera,Or we could steal a boat and  sail down the White Knife to White Harbor town.
769,Bran,Hodor,Robb wouldnt let anyone  hurt us.Hodor!
770,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor, hodor."
771,Bran,Hodor,"Hoooodor,Hooooooodor, hoooooodor, hoDOR, hoDOR, hoDOR."
772,Bran,Hodor,"HODOR,  HODOR, HODOR!"
773,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor,why dont you go outside and train with your  sword?"
774,Bran,Rickon,Hodor!
775,Bran,Hodor,HODOR!
776,Bran,Jojen,"Jojen, what did you mean about a teacher?"
777,Bran,Jojen,Youre my teacher.
778,Bran,Jojen,". So wide open that I fear you may fall through it, and live all the rest of your days as a wolf of the  woods.I wont, I promise.The boy promises."
779,Bran,Jojen,"You run with Summer, you hunt with him, kill with him ...  but you bend to his will more than him to yours.I just forget,Im only nine."
780,Bran,Jojen,"Even Florian the Fool and  Prince Aemon the Dragonknight werent great knights when they were nine.That is true,"
781,Bran,Jojen,Tell me the words of House Stark.Winter is coming.
782,Bran,Jojen,"I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth by chains of stone, and came to  Winterfell to free him.The chains are off you now, yet still you do not fly.Then you teach me."
783,Bran,Jojen,"Youre a greenseer.No,"
784,Bran,Jojen,"The gods give many gifts, Bran."
785,Bran,Meera,"We remember the First Men in the Neck, and the children of the forest who  were their friends ... but so much is forgotten, and so much we never knew."
786,Bran,Meera,"If we stay here, troubling no one, youll be safe until the war ends."
787,Bran,Greatjon,We are your servants to command.
788,Bran,Greatjon,"At least in this.You mean,youll do what I say? the girl replied, "
789,Bran,Davos,"I want to fly,Please.Take me to the crow."
790,Davos,Renly,"King Renlys shade was seen as well,slaying right and  left as he led the lion lords van."
791,Davos,Renly,Did none keep faith?
792,Davos,Renly,"Some few,The queens kin, them in chief."
793,Davos,Renly,Lord Florent is the  Kings Hand on Dragonstone now.
794,Davos,Melisandre,My prince will wish to see you at once.
795,Khorane,Melisandre,"The king,I must go to the king."
796,Khorane,Melisandre,"No one goes to the king,Salladhor Saan will tell you.Him first."
797,Davos,Salladhor,"Thirty-seven, thirtyeight, thirty-nine,"
798,Pycelle,Tyrion,
799,Davos,Salladhor,"These Pentoshi, do  they think I am not counting?"
800,Davos,Salladhor,"Is it pepper stinging my eyes,  or tears?"
801,Davos,Salladhor,"Why has he come to haunt me?I am no ghost, Salla.What else?My onion knight was never so thin or so pale as you."
802,Davos,Patchface,"You are still  warm, ser, and I feel your heart thumpetythumping."
803,Davos,Patchface,The sea that swallowed you has spit  you up again.
804,Tyrion,Tywin,I  swam beneath the chain and washed ashore on a spear of the merling king.
805,Davos,Salladhor,"This was well done, Khorane."
806,Davos,Salladhor,"Do not eat all  the olives, or I must be cross with you!"
807,Davos,Salladhor,"You must be forgiving me for the wine, my friend.These  Pentoshi would drink their own water if it were purple.It will help my chest,Hot wine is better than a compress, my mother used to say.You shall be needing compresses as well, I am thinking."
808,Davos,Salladhor,"He has fat cheeks, does he not?Who?"
809,Davos,Salladhor,Illyrio Mopatis.
810,Davos,Salladhor,"A fat man always sits comfortably, I am  thinking, for he takes his pillow with him wherever he goes.How is it you come by a Pentoshi ship?"
811,Davos,Salladhor,"Have you gone pirate again, my lord?"
812,Davos,Salladhor,Vile calumny.
813,Alester,Davos,"And when these outlaws are trying to steal past me in the night to avoid my lawful duties and  customs, why, they are no better than smugglers, so I am well within my rights to seize them."
814,Alester,Davos,"I cut off no mans fingers, though."
815,Alester,Davos,"The ships I am taking,  the cargoes, a few ransoms, nothing unreasonable."
816,Davos,Salladhor,"You are unwell, my  friend."
817,Davos,Salladhor,.
818,Davos,Salladhor,I lost it in the river.
819,Davos,Salladhor,"The river was terrible,Even from the bay, I was seeing, and  shuddering."
820,Davos,Salladhor,"I saw Black Betha burning, and Fury as well,Did none of our ships escape the fire?"
821,Davos,Salladhor,"Lord Steffon, Ragged Jenna, Swift Sword, Laughing Lord, and some others were upstream of the  pyromancerspissing, yes."
822,Davos,Salladhor,"Ragged Jenna and Laughing Lord are  still playing pirate on the river, I have heard, but who can say if it is so?Lady Marya?"
823,Davos,Salladhor,Wraith?
824,Davos,Salladhor,No.
825,Allard,Devan,"The brave boy never once left the kings side, or so they say."
826,Devan,Salladhor,The Mother is merciful.
827,Devan,Salladhor,"I must see him.Yes,And you will be wanting to sail to Cape Wrath, I know, to see your wife  and your two little ones.You must be having a new ship, I am thinking.His Grace will give me a ship,"
828,Davos,Salladhor,"Of ships, His Grace has none, and Salladhor Saan has many."
829,Alester,Selyse,"We will be having fat purses, yes.You are kind, Salla, but my dutys to my king, not your purse."
830,Alester,Selyse,"Stannis is still the  rightful heir by all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms.All the laws are not helping when all the ships bum up, I am thinking."
831,Davos,Salladhor,"There is no gold, not even a little bit to pay faithful  Salladhor Saan what is owed him, and only those knights that we took off at the end, and no ships but  my little brave few."
832,Davos,Salladhor,No one?
833,Davos,Salladhor,"What do you mean, he sees no one?"
834,Davos,Salladhor,"No one but her,My friend, you  tire yourself."
835,Davos,Salladhor,"A bed and many blankets, with a hot  compress for your chest and more wine and cloves."
836,Davos,Salladhor,I will be fine.
837,Davos,Salladhor,No one but Melisandre?
838,Davos,Salladhor,"The guards keep all others away,  even his queen and his little daughter.Servants bring meals that no one eats."
839,Davos,Melisandre,"Queer talking I have heard, of hungry fires within the mountain, and how Stannis and  the red woman go down together to watch the flames."
840,Davos,Melisandre,It is enough and more to  give an old man such terrors that sometimes he can scarcely find the strength to eat.
841,Davos,Melisandre,"The red woman did this to him,She sent the fire to consume us,  to punish Stannis for setting her aside, to teach him that he could not hope to win without her sorceries."
842,Davos,Melisandre,"You are not the first to be saying this, my  friend."
843,Davos,Salladhor,"Dragonstone crawls with these queens men, oh yes,  and they have sharp ears and sharper knives."
844,Davos,Salladhor,I have a knife myself.Captain Khorane made me a gift of it.
845,Davos,Salladhor,A knife to cut out Melisandres heart.If she has one.
846,Davos,Salladhor,"Davos, good Davos, you must not be saying such things, even in  jest.No jest.I mean to kill her."
847,Davos,Salladhor,"These are dangerous talkings, my friend,I am thinking you are still sick  from the sea."
848,Davos,Salladhor,"Best you are taking to your bed for a long resting,  until you are stronger."
849,Davos,Salladhor,"You are a treacherous old rogue, Salladhor Saan, but a good friend all the same."
850,Davos,Salladhor,"So with this great friend you will be staying, yes?No, I will be going."
851,Davos,Salladhor,Go?
852,Davos,Salladhor,"Where will you be going?To the castle.My bed is there, and my son.And the red woman,She is in the castle also.Her too."
853,Davos,Salladhor,"You are an onion smuggler, what do you know of skulkings and stabbings?"
854,Davos,Salladhor,"Servants of the dark, she named them, poor men,  and the red woman sang as the fires were lit."
855,Davos,Melisandre,"She took Lord Sunglass from  the dungeons,and Hubard Rambtons sons.Just so, and burned them, as she will bum you."
856,Davos,Melisandre,"And you have only just come back to life!And this is why,To do this thing."
857,Davos,Melisandre,"Shayalas Dance should never have come near me.A wind,an ill wind, is all."
858,Melisandre,Salladhor,Your mother is dead.
859,Melisandre,Salladhor,. The Mother.
860,Davos,Salladhor,I rowed Melisandre into the bowels of Storms End and  watched her birth a horror.
861,Davos,Salladhor,"She killed Cressen and Lord Renly and a brave man  named Cormay Penrose, and she killed my sons as well.Now it is time someone killed her.Someone,Yes, just so, someone."
862,Davos,Salladhor,"But you, no, you must sit and eat."
863,Davos,Salladhor,"I have  vengeance in my belly, Salla."
864,Davos,Salladhor,"For our friendship, wish me  luck and let me go."
865,Davos,Salladhor,"You are no true friend, I am thinking."
866,Davos,Salladhor,"I will gather your bones in a sack and give them to the sons you leave behind, to wear in little bags  around their necks."
867,Davos,Salladhor,"Go, go, go, go, go."
868,Davos,Salladhor,Salla - GO.
869,Davos,Salladhor,Who goes there? 
870,Davos,Salladhor,"Ser Davos Seaworth, to see His  Grace.Are you drunk?Go away and stop that pounding."
871,Davos,Salladhor,"Send for my son, then.Devan, the kings  squire."
872,Davos,Salladhor,"Who did you say you were?Davos,The onion knight."
873,Davos,Salladhor,Be off with you.
874,Davos,Salladhor,"His  ship burned.His ship burned,but he lived, and here he stands. the crossbowman said, but his face betrayed a sudden doubt."
875,Aegon,Davos,Go round to the sally port and theyll admit you.
876,Aegon,Davos,"Wait here,Does His Grace know that Ive returned?"
877,Aegon,Davos,"Bugger all if I know.Wait, I said."
878,Davos,Shireen,"You come  back now,Patches, you come back."
879,Hop,Shireen,"Fools blood, kings blood, blood  on the maidens thigh, but chains for the guests and chains for the bridegroom, aye aye aye."
880,Davos,Shireen,What  are you doing here?
881,Chett,Davos,"You shouldnt get in my way when Im running.No,I shouldnt."
882,Chett,Davos,Are you unwell?
883,Davos,Edric,Should I summon the  maester?
884,Davos,Edric,A cough.It will pass.
885,Davos,Edric,"We were playing monsters and maidens, I was the  monster."
886,Davos,Edric,Do you have a name?Ser Davos Seaworth.
887,Davos,Edric,"Are you certain?You dont look very knightly.I am the knight of the onions, my lord."
888,Davos,Edric,"The one with the black ship?You know that tale?You brought my uncle Stannis fish to eat before I was born, when Lord Tyrell had him under siege."
889,Davos,Edric,"I am Edric Storm,King Roberts son.Of course you are."
890,Davos,Edric,Did you know my father?
891,Davos,Edric,"I saw him many a time while calling on your uncle at court, but we never spoke.My father taught me to fight,He came to see me almost every year, and  sometimes we trained together."
892,Davos,Edric,"Is it true my uncle Stannis cut off your fingers?Only the last joint.I still have fingers, only shorter.Show me."
893,Davos,Robert,He did not shorten your thumb?No.
894,Davos,Robert,"No, he left me that.He should not have chopped any of your fingers,That was ill done.I was a smuggler.Yes, but you smuggled him fish and onions.Lord Stannis knighted me for the onions, and took my fingers for the smuggling."
895,Robert,Stannis,"My father would not have chopped your fingers.As you say, my lord."
896,Craster,Samwell,"Ser Davos, and undrowned."
897,Axell,Davos,"Seize him, and take his  dirk.He means to use it on our lady."
898,Brienne,Cleos,"No smoke from the chimneys,Nor lights in the  windows.The inn was still open when last I passed this way,They brewed a fine ale.Perhaps there is still some to be had in the cellars.There may be people,Hiding.Or dead.Frightened of a few corpses, wench?"
899,Brienne,Jaime,My name is - 
900,Brienne,Jaime,"Wed be safer than on the  open river, and it might be prudent to find whats happened here."
901,Cleos,Jaime,We could not have found a better inn.Is this some special place?
902,Aegon,Cleos,"This is the Inn of the Kneeling Man, my lady."
903,Aegon,Cleos,"Thats him on the  sign, I suppose.Torrhen had brought his power south after the fall of the two kings on the Field of Fire,but when he saw Aegons dragon and the size of his host, he chose the path of wisdom and bent his  frozen knees."
904,Aegon,Jaime,Horses in the stable.One at least.
905,Aegon,Jaime,"Lets see whos home, shall we?"
906,Cleos,Jaime,"Lion, fish, or wolf?"
907,Cleos,Jaime,We were hoping for capon.
908,Cleos,Jaime,"The crossbow is a  cowards weapon.Itll put a bolt through your heart all the same.Perhaps.But before you can wind it again my cousin here will spill your entrails on the floor.Dont be scaring the lad, now,We mean no harm,And we have coin to pay for food and drink."
909,Cleos,Jaime,"Whys this one in irons?Killed some crossbowmen,Do you have ale?Yes."
910,Brienne,Jaime,"Undo your swordbelts and let them fall, and might be  well feed you."
911,Brienne,Cleos,Thats a Tully sail.We come from Riverrun.
912,Brienne,Jaime,"Three, are you?We got horsemeat enough for three, The horse was old and tough, but the  meats still fresh.Is there bread?"
913,Brienne,Jaime,Hardbread and stale oatcakes.
914,Brienne,Jaime,"Now theres an honest innkeep.Theyll all serve you stale bread and stringy meat, but  most dont own up to it so freely.Im no innkeep.I buried him out back, with his women.Did you kill them?Would I tell you if I did?"
915,Cleos,Jaime,"Likely it were wolves work, or maybe lions, whats the  difference?"
916,Brienne,Cleos,"The way we see it, the place is ours now.Where is this wife of yours?"
917,Brienne,Cleos,"And why would you be wanting to know that?Shes not here ...  no moren you three will be, unless I like the taste of your silver."
918,Brienne,Cleos,"Shes got more,So she does.Boy, go down and find me some onions."
919,Cleos,Jaime,Your son?
920,Cleos,Jaime,Just a boy the wife and me took in.
921,Cleos,Jaime,"These days, a man needs someone to keep watch  while he sleeps."
922,Cleos,Jaime,Might as well sit.
923,Brienne,Cleos,What news from Riverrun?
924,Brienne,Cleos,"Lord Hoster is failing, but his son holds the fords of the  Red Fork against the Lannisters.There have been battles.Battles everywhere.Where are you bound, ser?Kings Landing."
925,Cleos,Stannis,Then youre three fools.
926,Jaime,Stannis,They  say he has a hundred thousand men and a magic sword.
927,Cleos,Stannis,"Id stay well clear of that kingsroad, if I were you,its worse than bad, I hear.Wolves and lions both, and bands of broken men preying on anyone they can catch.Vermin,Such would never dare to trouble armed men.Begging your pardon, ser, but I see one armed man, traveling with a woman and a prisoner in chains."
928,Brienne,Jaime,"I mean to follow the Trident to the sea,Well find mounts at Maidenpool  and ride by way of Duskendale and Rosby.That should keep us well away from the worst of the  fighting."
929,Brienne,Jaime,Youll never reach Maidenpool by river.
930,Cleos,Jaime,"He crosses the river wherever  he likes, riding this way and that way, never still.And who is this lightning lord?"
931,Cleos,Jaime,"Lord Beric, as it please you, ser."
932,Cleos,Jaime,Its said he cannot die.
933,Jaime,Robert,Does Thoros of Myr still ride with  him?Aye.
934,Jaime,Robert,Ive heard tell he has strange powers.
935,Cersei,Robert,"Far  be it from me to make objection,but perhaps the Trident is not our safest course.Id say thats so,Even if you get past Red Deer island and dont meet up with Lord  Beric and the red wizard, theres still the ruby ford before you."
936,Brienne,Jaime,"By now it could be lions again, or Lord Beric, or  anyone.Or no one,If mlady cares to wager her skin on that I wont stop her ... but if I was you, Id leave this here river,  cut overland.If you stay off the main roads and shelter under the trees of a night, hidden as it were ...  well, I still wouldnt want to go with you, but you might stand a mummers chance."
937,Brienne,Jaime,"We would need horses.There are horses here,I heard one in the stable.Aye, there are,Three of them, as it happens, but theyre not  for sale."
938,Brienne,Jaime,"Of course not.But youll show them to us anyway.Show me,"
939,Brienne,Jaime,"Theyre not for sale at any price,How did you come by these horses?"
940,Brienne,Jaime,"The dray was stabled here when the wife and me come on the inn,"
941,Brienne,Jaime,"Here, Ill show you."
942,Brienne,Jaime,"Well, her owner wont be coming to claim her anytime soon."
943,Brienne,Catelyn,"Give him a gold piece for the grey, if hell  include the saddle,A silver for the plow horse.He ought to pay us for taking the  white off his hands.Dont speak discourteously of your horse, ser."
944,Brienne,Catelyn,I will pay you a dragon for each.
945,Catelyn,Jaime,I dont know.
946,Brienne,Jaime,"Nor eat one if Im hungry.You can have our skiff as well,Sail up the river or down, as you like.Let me have a taste ol that gold."
947,Brienne,Jaime,Hm.
948,Brienne,Jaime,"Three dragons and the skiff?Hes robbing you blind, wench,Ill want provisions too,Whatever you have that you can  spare.Theres more oatcakes."
949,Brienne,Jaime,"Aye, and smoked salt fish, but that will cost you silver."
950,Brienne,Cleos,"Youll be  wanting to stay the night.No,"
951,Brienne,Cleos,"Woman, you dont want to go riding at night through strange country on  horses you dont know.Youre like to blunder into some bog or break your horses leg.The moon will be bright tonight,Well have no trouble finding our way."
952,Brienne,Cleos,"If you dont have the silver, might be some coppers would buy you them  beds, and a coverlet or two to keep you warm.Its not like Im turning travelers away, if you get my  meaning.That sounds more than fair,The coverlets is fresh washed, too."
953,Brienne,Cleos,"Not a flea to be found  neither, you have my word on that."
954,Brienne,Cleos,"A proper bed would do us all good, my lady,Wed make better time on the morrow once refreshed."
955,Brienne,Cleos,"No, coz, the wench is right."
956,Brienne,Cleos,"We ought ride on.But,you said yourself -  "
957,Brienne,Cleos,"Now I have a full belly, and a moonlight ride will be just the  thing."
958,Brienne,Cleos,"But unless you mean to throw me over the back of that plow horse like  a sack of flour, someone had best do something about these irons.Its difficult to ride with your ankles  chained together."
959,Brienne,Cleos,"Theres a smithy round  back of the stable.Show me,Yes,"
960,Brienne,Cleos,I  would hate to step in it.
961,Brienne,Jaime,"Six miles downriver youll see a burned village,"
962,Brienne,Jaime,The road splits there.
963,Brienne,Jaime,"Youd do better to follow the track through the woods, south by east.We shall,You have my thanks."
964,Cleos,Jaime,"Take up the spear or maul,theyll serve you better."
965,Cleos,Jaime,"But this is the road the innkeep warned us against,He was no innkeep."
966,Cleos,Jaime,"The man took too great an interest in our choice of route, and those woods ... such places  are notorious haunts of outlaws.He may have been urging us into a trap.Clever wench."
967,Cleos,Jaime,"Our host has friends down that road, I would venture.The  ones whose mounts gave that stable such a memorable aroma.He may have been lying about the river as well, to put us on these horses,but I could  not take the risk."
968,Brienne,Cersei,"Ill take the first watch,"
969,Brienne,Tyrion,"Do  you have any siblings, my lady? "
970,Brienne,Jaime,No.I was my fathers only s child.
971,Brienne,Jaime,"Son, you meant to say."
972,Brienne,Jaime,"You make a queer sort of  daughter, to be sure."
973,Hodor,Jojen,"I did not  intend togive offense, Brienne."
974,Brienne,Jaime,Why do I enrage you so?Ive never done you harm  that I know of.Youve harmed others.
975,Aerys,Brienne,. .
976,Aerys,Brienne,the king?
977,Aerys,Brienne,"Dont presume to judge what you do not understand,  wench.My name is -  - Brienne, yes."
978,Aerys,Brienne,Why don the white cloak if you meant to betray all it  stood for?
979,Aerys,Brienne,I was a boy.
980,Brienne,Cersei,"It was a great honor  for one so young.That is no answer,"
981,Aerys,Jaime,"Father will never consent,The king wont ask him."
982,Cersei,Ilyn,"He wont stop this, either.But,theres Casterly Rock...Is it a rock you want?"
983,Jon,Melisandre,
984,Aerys,Jaime,. 
985,Aerys,Jaime,"Aerys was mad and cruel, no one has ever denied that."
986,Aerys,Catelyn,And you had swom to protect him.I know what I swore.And what you did.
987,Aerys,Catelyn,"Yes, and what you did as well.Were both kingslayers here, if what Ive heard is true.I never harmed Renly.Ill kill the man who says I did.Best start with Cleos, then.And youll have a deal of killing to do after that, the way he tells the tale.Lies."
988,Jaime,Renly,  
989,Jaime,Renly,"Your wits are quicker than mine, I confess it.When they found me  standing over my dead king, I never thought to say, No, no, it wasnt me, it was a shadow, a terrible  cold shadow."
990,Jaime,Renly,"Tell me true, one kingslayer to another did the Starks pay you to slit  his throat, or was it Stannis?"
991,Brienne,Jaime,Never give a wench a sword when shes bleeding.
992,Brienne,Jaime,"It is a rare and precious gift to be a knight,and even more so a knight of the  Kingsguard."
993,Arthur,Brienne,I earned my knighthood.
994,Arthur,Brienne,"It  was the gods who neglected to give you a cock, not me."
995,Aerys,Tywin,"I want him  dead, the traitor."
996,Jaime,Tywin,"Whose?Rossarts,"
997,Aerys,Gregor,"The castle is ours, ser, and the city,"
998,Jaime,Tywin,"Tell them the Mad King is dead,Spare all those who yield and hold them captive,Shall I proclaim a new king as well?"
999,Eddard,Maegor,"Proclaim who you bloody  well like,"
1000,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord Tyrion,So you do remember me?I had begun to wonder.It is so very good to see you looking so strong and well."
1001,Tyrion,Varys,"Though I  confess, I had not thought to find you in mine own humble chambers.They are humble.Excessively so, in truth."
1002,Tyrion,Varys,"Id hoped to discover bushel baskets of juicy secrets to  while away the waiting, but theres not a paper to be found."
1003,Tyrion,Varys,"There was water in your flagon, gods have mercy,"
1004,Tyrion,Varys,"I am plagued with backaches, my lord, and prefer to sleep upon a  hard surface.I would have taken you for a featherbed man.I am full of surprises.Are you cross with me for abandoning you after the battle?It made me think of you as one of my family.It was not for want of love, my good lord. He gave an exaggerated shudder.  Tyrion rubbed irritably at the scab."
1005,Pycelle,Varys,Or should I tell the goldsmith that I want  my fathers nose?
1006,Pycelle,Varys,"My noble father labors so diligently that I scarce see him anymore.Tell  me, is it true that hes restoring Grand Maester Pycelle to the small council?It is, my lord.Do I have my sweet sister to thank for that?"
1007,Tyrion,Varys,"Not at all, my lord.Thank the archmaesters of Oldtown, those who wished to insist on Pycelles  restoration on the grounds that only the Conclave may make or unmake a Grand Maester."
1008,Tyrion,Varys,"I seem to recall that Maegor the Cruels headsman unmade three with his  axe.Quite true,And the second Aegon fed Grand Maester Gerardys to his dragon.Alas, I am quite dragonless."
1009,Pycelle,Varys,"Would the Citadel have preferred that?Well, it would have been more in keeping with tradition."
1010,Pycelle,Varys,"Thankfully, wiser heads  prevailed, and the Conclave accepted the fact of Pycelles dismissal and set about choosing his  successor."
1011,Tyrion,Varys,"When I told your lord father, he acted at once."
1012,Cersei,Varys,I see.So my father decided to nip the rose before it  bloomed.
1013,Cersei,Varys,"Pycelle is a toad.But better a Lannister toad than a Tyrell toad, no?Grand Maester Pycelle has always been a good friend to your House,Perhaps it  will console you to learn that Ser Boros Blount is also being restored."
1014,Cersei,Tyrion,"Blount is a blustering coward,Is he?"
1015,Boros,Tyrion,"He will no doubt remain very loyal.To my father,While we are on the subject of the Kingsguard ...I wonder, could this delightfully unexpected visit of  yours happen to concern Ser Boross fallen brother, the gallant Ser Mandon Moore?"
1016,Bronn,Mandon,Your man Bronn seems most interested in him of late.
1017,Tyrion,Varys,"The man seems to have been quite friendless,Sadly,"
1018,Mandon,Tyrion,"And he died as a knight of the  Kingsguard ought, with sword in hand, defending one of the kings own blood."
1019,Mandon,Varys,It is not Ser Mandon who brings me here.To be sure.
1020,Mandon,Varys,"May I serve you, my lord?"
1021,Mandon,Varys,Yes.But not with water.
1022,Tyrion,Varys,I want you to bring me Shae.
1023,Tyrion,Varys,"Is that wise, my lord?"
1024,Tyrion,Varys,it would be such a shame if your father  hanged her.
1025,Tyrion,Varys,"No, its not wise, its bloody madness."
1026,Tyrion,Varys,I cannot abide having her so close.I understand.
1027,Tyrion,Varys,"MIord,I have seen her several  times,but I dare not speak to her."
1028,Chett,Tyrion,"The Kettleblacks report frequently to your sweet sister.When I think of how much coin I paid those wretched ... do you think theres any chance that more  gold might win them away from Cersei?There is always a chance, but I should not care to wager on the likelihood.They are knights now, all  three, and your sister has promised them further advancement."
1029,Chett,Tyrion,"And the eldest, Ser Osmund of the Kingsguard, dreams of certain other ... favors ... as  well.You can match the queen coin for coin, I have no doubt, but she has a second purse that is quite  inexhaustible."
1030,Chett,Tyrion,"Are you suggesting that Cerseis fucking Osmund Kettleblack?Oh, dear me, no, that would be dreadfully dangerous, dont you think?"
1031,Janos,Tyrion,But what would a  eunuch know of such things?
1032,Janos,Tyrion,"Are the Kettleblacks the only ones?Would that were true, my lord."
1033,Petyr,Tyrion,"Should you be so unwise as to visit any of them, he will know at once, and your lord father soon  thereafter."
1034,Petyr,Tyrion,And my father?Who does he have spying on me?
1035,Tyrion,Varys,"Why, me, my lord."
1036,Shae,Varys,"You will bring Shae to    me through the walls, hidden from all these eyes.As you have done before."
1037,Shae,Varys,"Oh, my lord, nothing would please me more, but ... King Maegor wanted no  rats in his own walls, if you take my meaning."
1038,Tyrion,Varys,"I can steal your Shae  away from Lady Lollys for a time, to be sure, but I have no way to bring her to your bedchamber without  us being seen.Then bring her somewhere else.But where?There is no safe place.There is."
1039,Tyrion,Varys,"Here.Its time to put that rock-hard bed of yours to better use, I think."
1040,Tyrion,Varys,Lollys tires easily these days.
1041,Tyrion,Varys,I  imagine she will be safely asleep by moonrise.
1042,Tyrion,Varys,"Moonrise, then."
1043,Tyrion,Varys,And two clean  cups.
1044,Tyrion,Varys,it shall be as my lord commands.
1045,Podrick,Varys,"Will you be long, my lord?"
1046,Tyrion,Varys,"Oh, I hope so."
1047,Loras,Tyrion,"How old are you, Ser Loras?"
1048,Loras,Tyrion,"Seventeen, my lord."
1049,Loras,Tyrion,"If you will pardon my asking, ser - why would anyone choose to join  the Kingsguard at seventeen?Prince Aemon the Dragonknight took his vows at seventeen,and your brother Jaime  was younger still.I know their reasons."
1050,Loras,Tyrion,The honor of serving beside such paragons as Meryn Trant and  Boros Blount?
1051,Loras,Tyrion,"To guard the kings life, you surrender your own."
1052,Loras,Tyrion,". House Tyrell continues through my brothers,It is not necessary for a third son to wed,  or breed.Not necessary, but some find it pleasant.What of love?When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.Is that from a song?"
1053,Loras,Tyrion,"Yes, you are seventeen, I see that now."
1054,Loras,Tyrion,Do you mock me?
1055,Loras,Tyrion,No.
1056,Loras,Tyrion,"I had my own love once, and we had a song as  well."
1057,Sandor,Tyrion,Varys?
1058,Tyrion,Varys,Are you there?
1059,Tyrion,Varys,My lord.
1060,Tyrion,Varys,Is something amiss?
1061,Tyrion,Varys,"For one horrid moment I thought youd brought me Lollys instead of  Shae.Where is she?Here, mlord."
1062,Shae,Varys,"Can you guess what Im wearing?Nothing?Oh, youre so smart,How did you know?Youre very beautiful in nothing.Am I?"
1063,Shae,Tyrion,Am I truly?Oh yes.
1064,Shae,Tyrion,"Hurry,oh, hurry, hurry, I want you in me, in me, in me."
1065,Shae,Tyrion,"My giant, my giant, my giant,"
1066,Shae,Tyrion,"My giant of Lannister,Stay inside me, please.I like to feel you there."
1067,Tyrion,Varys,"Shae,"
1068,Tyrion,Varys,  
1069,Shae,Varys,It makes you look very fierce and strong.
1070,Shae,Varys,"Very ugly, you mean.Mlord will never be ugly in my eyes."
1071,Shae,Varys,"Its not my face that need concern you, its my father -  "
1072,Shae,Varys,What would have become of them if youd died?I didnt die.Here I am.I know.
1073,Shae,Tyrion,Just where you belong.
1074,Shae,Tyrion,"But how  long must I go on with Lollys, now that youre well?Have you been listening?"
1075,Shae,Tyrion,"You can stay with Lollys if you like, but it would be best if you  left the city.I dont want to leave.You promised youd move me into a manse again after the battle."
1076,Lollys,Tyrion,"A Lannister always pays his debts, you  said.Shae, gods be damned, stop that."
1077,Lollys,Shae,You dont understand the dangers.Can I come to the kings wedding feast?
1078,Lollys,Shae,"I told her no ones like to rape her in the  kings own throne room, but shes so stupid."
1079,Shae,Tyrion,"Symon says theres to be a singers tourney, and tumblers, even a fools joust."
1080,Shae,Tyrion,"How is it you spoke to Symon?I told Lady Tanda about him, and she hired him to play for Lollys."
1081,Shae,Symon,Ive never  seen a bear dance.They do it worse than I do.
1082,Shae,Tyrion,"Symon says theres to be seventy-seven courses and a hundred doves baked into a great pie,When the crusts opened, theyll all burst out and fly.After which they will roost in the rafters and rain down birdshit on the guests."
1083,Shae,Tyrion,Couldnt I dress in my silks and velvets and go as a lady instead of a maidservant?No one would know  I wasnt.
1084,Shae,Tyrion,"Lady Tanda might wonder where Lollyss bedmaid  found so many jewels.Theres to be a thousand guests, Symon says."
1085,Shae,Tyrion,"Id find a place in some dark  comer below the salt, but whenever you got up to go to the privy I could slip out and meet you."
1086,Shae,Tyrion,"I wont wear any smallclothes under my gown, so mlord wont  even need to unlace me."
1087,Shae,Tyrion,"Or if he liked, I could do this for him."
1088,Shae,Tyrion,"Youll let me come, wont you?Shae,it is not safe."
1089,Arstan,Jorah,Theyre under the bed.
1090,Shae,Tyrion,The bed?
1091,Shae,Tyrion,"It weighs half a ton.Theres a place where Varys pushes, and it floats right up.I asked him how, and he said it was magic.Yes."
1092,Shae,Tyrion,A counterweight spell.
1093,Shae,Tyrion,I should go back.Sometimes the baby kicks and Lollys wakes and calls for me.Varys should return shortly.Hes probably listening to every word we say.
1094,Shae,Tyrion,"I will,You are my lion, arent you?My giant of Lannister?I am,And youre -  "
1095,Shae,Tyrion,I know.
1096,Podrick,Tyrion,  
1097,Podrick,Tyrion,"Bronn,Ser Bronn?"
1098,Podrick,Tyrion,Oh.
1099,Podrick,Tyrion,"My lord?Why no, I woke you up so we could have a little chat about the way he dresses,"
1100,Bronn,Tyrion,Now.
1101,Bronn,Tyrion,"I hope the boy had a damn good reason dragging me out of Chatayas,Chatayas?"
1102,Bronn,Tyrion,Its good to be a knight.No more looking for the cheaper brothels down the street.
1103,Bronn,Tyrion,"Now its Alayaya and Marei in the same featherbed, with Ser Bronn in the middle."
1104,Shae,Tyrion,"There is a singer who calls himself Symon Silver Tongue,He plays for Lady Tandas daughter sometimes.What of him?"
1105,Arya,Shae,"Find him,Find him before someone else  does."
1106,Arya,Hot,"Off to Gulltown to  see the fair maid, heigh-ho, heigh-ho..."
1107,Gendry,Hot,"Ill steal a sweet kiss with the point of my blade, heigh-ho, heigh-ho."
1108,Arya,Hot,Do you hear?
1109,Arya,Gendry,"Someones  coming.Go wake Gendry,Just shake him by the shoulder, dont make a lot of noise."
1110,Gendry,Hot,"Ill make her my love and well rest in the shade, heigh-ho, heigh-ho."
1111,Gendry,Hot,We have to hide.
1112,Harren,Hot,"Take  Gendry and the horses behind the cottage,"
1113,Arya,Hot,What about you?Ill hide by the tree.
1114,Arya,Hot,Go!
1115,Arya,Syrio,Did you hear that?
1116,Arya,Syrio,"Theres something behind that wall, I would say.Aye,What do you think it might be, Archer?"
1117,Arya,Syrio,A bear.
1118,Arya,Syrio,"A lot of meat on a bear,A lot of fat as well, in fall.Good to eat, if its cooked up  right.Could be a wolf.Maybe a lion.With four feet, you think?Or two?Makes no matter.Does it?Not so I know.Archer, what do you mean to do with all them arrows? Drop a few shafts over the wall.Whatevers hiding back there will come out quick enough, watch and  see.What if its some honest man back there, though?Or some poor woman with a little babe at her  breast?An honest man would come out and show us his face.Only an outlaw would skulk and hide.Aye, thats so.Go on and loose your shafts, then."
1119,Arya,Syrio,Dont!
1120,Gendry,Lem,"Boy,put up that sword now, unless youre wanting to be hurt. Arya said, "
1121,Gendry,Lem,My pardons.You go on down the road.
1122,Gendry,Lem,Go away and leave us be and I wont kill you.
1123,Gendry,Lem,"Lem, she wont kill us, did you hear? I heard,Child,"
1124,Gendry,Hot,No place for a little girl to be  wandering alone.Shes not alone.
1125,Gendry,Hot,"Do like she says, and leave us be,Two and three,"
1126,Arya,Gendry,Where did  you steal them?Theyre ours.
1127,Gendry,Hot,Will you give us your names like honest men?
1128,Gendry,Hot,"Im Hot Pie,Aye, and good for you."
1129,Gendry,Hot,"Its not every day I meet a lad with such a tasty name.And  what would your friends be called, Mutton Chop and Squab?"
1130,Gendry,Lem,"Why should I tell you my name?I havent heard yours.Well, as to that, Im Tom of Sevenstreams, but Tom Sevenstrings is what they call me, or Tom o  Sevens."
1131,Arya,Lem,"And young fellow me lad over there is Anguy, or Archer as we like to call him.Now who are you?"
1132,Arya,Gendry,"Squab, if you want,I dont  care."
1133,Arya,Gendry,"A squab with a sword,Now theres something you dont often see.Im the Bull,"
1134,Arya,Gendry,"Hot Pie, Squab, and the Bull.Escaped from Lord Boltons  kitchen, did you?How did you know?"
1135,Arya,Gendry,"You bear his sigil on your chest, little one."
1136,Hot,Lem,Dont call me little one!Why not?
1137,Hot,Lem,Youre little enough.Im bigger than I was.Im not a child.
1138,Hot,Lem,"I can see that, Squab.Youre none of you children, not if you were Boltons.We never were."
1139,Anguy,Hot,"We were at Harrenhal before he came,  thats all.So youre lion cubs, is that the way of it?"
1140,Anguy,Hot,Not that either.
1141,Anguy,Arya,Whose men are you?Were kings men.
1142,Arya,Lem,"Which king?King Robert,That old drunk?"
1143,Arya,Gendry,"Hes dead, some boar killed him, everyone knows that.Aye, lad,and mores the pity."
1144,Arya,Hot,"Were looking for Riverrun,How many days ride is it, do you  know?"
1145,Arya,Hot,"You be quiet, or Ill stuff rocks in your big stupid mouth,Riverrun is a long way upstream,A long hungry way."
1146,Arya,Gendry,"We could share some ale and a  bite of bread, instead of fighting one another.An inn?"
1147,Arya,Gendry,"Its near, you say?Two miles upstream,A league at most."
1148,Arya,Gendry,"What do you mean, friends?"
1149,Arya,Gendry,"Friends.Have you forgotten what friends are?Shama is the innkeeps name,She has a sharp tongue and a fierce eye, Ill grant you that,  but her hearts a good one, and shes fond of little girls.Im not a little girl,Who else is there?"
1150,Arya,Gendry,Fresh bread and maybe a bit of meat.
1151,Arya,Gendry,"And  whatever you stole from Old Pates garden besides.We never stole,Are you Old Pates daughter, then?"
1152,Arya,Syrio,"I buried Old Pate myself,  right there under that willow where you were hiding, and you dont have his look."
1153,Arya,Syrio,"Weve buried many a good man this past year, but weve no wish to bury you, I swear it  on my harp.Archer, show her."
1154,Anguy,Lem,"You missed,More fool you if you think so,They go where I send them.That they do,"
1155,Arya,Lem,"Well come see this inn,You walk in front and well ride behind, so we can see what youre doing."
1156,Arya,Lem,"Anguy, best pull up those arrows, we wont be needing them here."
1157,Anguy,Arya,"Hot Pie, get those cabbages,And the carrots too."
1158,Anguy,Arya,Do you  know any songs?
1159,Anguy,Arya,"Id dearly love someone to sing with, that I would.Lem cant carry a  tune, and our longbow lad only knows marcher ballads, every one of them a hundred verses long.We sing real songs in the marches,Singing is stupid,Singing makes noise."
1160,Arya,Lem,We could have killed  you.
1161,Gendry,Lem,"There are worse things than dying with a song on your lips.If there were wolves hereabouts, wed know it,Or lions.These are our woods.You never knew we were there,Now, lad, you shouldnt be so certain of that,Sometimes a man knows more than he says."
1162,Gendry,Hot,"I know the song about the bear,Some of it, anyhow."
1163,Gendry,Hot,"Then lets hear it, pie boy."
1164,Arya,Hot,. 
1165,Anguy,Lem,Do you think Shama might have lemons  down in that cellar of hers?
1166,Hot,Lem,A Domish  girl once cooked me duck with lemons.
1167,Arya,Gendry,"Gendry,They have a boat."
1168,Arya,Gendry,"It would be faster than riding, I think."
1169,Arya,Gendry,"Did you ever sail a boat?You put up the sail,and the wind pushes it.What if the wind is blowing the wrong way?Then theres oars to row.Against the current?"
1170,Arya,Gendry,Wouldnt that be slow?
1171,Arya,Gendry,"Its not our boat anyway, its the inns."
1172,Arya,Gendry,"One of us should watch the horses,"
1173,Arya,Gendry,"Theres no need for that, Squab.Come eat, theyll be safe enough.Ill stay,You can come get me after youve had some food."
1174,Lem,Roose,"Dont just stand there, boy,Or are you a girl?"
1175,Anguy,Lem,Youre all mud.We shot a duck.
1176,Anguy,Lem,"Anguy shot a duck, is what youre meaning.Get your boots off,  are you deaf or just stupid?"
1177,Anguy,Lem,Husband!
1178,Anguy,Lem,"Get up here, the lads are  back.Husband!"
1179,Anguy,Lem,"Im here, woman,  quit your bellowing.What is it now?Hang this,"
1180,Anguy,Arya,"We were thinking we might eat it, Shama."
1181,Anguy,Arya,If you had some.Lemons.
1182,Anguy,Arya,"Why  dont you hop out back to the lemon trees and pick us a bushel, and some nice olives and pomegranates  too."
1183,Anguy,Arya,"Now, I suppose I could cook it with Lems cloak, if you like, but not till  its hung for a few days."
1184,Arya,Rorge,"or might be youd like it stewed, with ale and onions."
1185,Arya,Rorge,"We have no coin, but we brought some carrots and cabbages we  could trade you.Did you now?And where would they be?Hot Pie, give her the cabbages,"
1186,Biter,Vargo,Where is this hot pie?Here.
1187,Biter,Vargo,Squab.Not under my roof.
1188,Arya,Hot,Husband!
1189,Arya,Hot,"The ducks hung.What is it now,  woman?Wash these vegetables,The rest of you, sit down while I start the rabbits.The boy  will bring you drink."
1190,Arya,Hot,"I am not in the habit of  serving ale to children, but the ciders run out, theres no cows for milk, and the river water tastes of war,  with all the dead men drifting downstream.If I served you a cup of soup full of dead flies, would you  drink it?Arry would,I mean, Squab.So would Lem,Never you mind about Lem,Its ale for all."
1191,Arya,Lem,"A lonely inn on a forest road,The innkeeps wife was plain as a toad.Shut up with that now or we wont be getting no rabbit,You know how she is."
1192,Arya,Hot,Can you sail a boat?
1193,Anguy,Arya,"Ale,and rabbit.Well, heres to His Grace,Seven save the king!All twelve othem,"
1194,Arya,Lem,"Theres  strange horses in the stable,Aye,and better horses than the three you gave away."
1195,Arya,Lem,I never gave them away.
1196,Arya,Lem,"Anyways, you lot were supposed to get them back."
1197,Arya,Lem,"They never came our way,Well, I sent them.You must have been drunk, or asleep.Us?Drunk?"
1198,Arya,Lem,"Never.You could have taken them yourself,What, with only the boy here?"
1199,Anguy,Lem,And like as not it was one o you planted the bastard in the poor girls belly.
1200,Anguy,Lem,"You, Id wager, with that harp o yours, singing all them sad songs just to get poor  Fem out of her smallclothes.If a song makes a maid want to slip off her clothes and feel the good warm sun kiss her skin, why, is  that the singers fault?"
1201,Anguy,Lem,"And twas Anguy she fancied, besides."
1202,Anguy,Arya,"Could I give it a little pull, do you think?"
1203,Anguy,Arya,"You and Anguy, makes no matter which."
1204,Anguy,Arya,"What can one man do against three?Three,but one a woman and Vother in chains, you said so yourself."
1205,Anguy,Arya,"A big woman, dressed like a man."
1206,Anguy,Arya,I didnt fancy the  look of his eyes.
1207,Anguy,Arya,"When I dont fancy a mans eyes, I put an arrow through one."
1208,Anguy,Arya,"You be quiet when your elders are talking.Drink your ale and mind your  tongue, or Ill have the old woman take a spoon to you.My elders talk too much, and I dont need you to tell me to drink my ale."
1209,Hot,Lem,"Thats bad bread,Its burned, and tough  besides.Its better when theres stew to sop up,No, it isnt,but youre less like to break your teeth.You can eat it or go hungry,Do I look like some bloody baker?Id like to see you  make better.I could,Its easy.You kneaded the dough too much, thats why its so hard to chew."
1210,Arya,Hot,"Squab,or Arry, or whatever your true name might be, this is  for you."
1211,Arya,Hot,What is it?Three golden dragons.We need to buy those horses.
1212,Arya,Hot,"Theyre our horses.Meaning you stole them yourselves, is that it?"
1213,Arya,Hot,War makes thieves of many honest  folk.
1214,Arya,Hot,Im paying you a handsome price.
1215,Arya,Hot,"Theres no gold,Its only  writing.Aye,and Im sorry for that."
1216,Arya,Hot,"Youre no kings men, youre robbers.If youd ever met a true robber, youd know they do not pay, not even in paper."
1217,Arya,Lem,Would you deny the king?
1218,Arya,Hot,We dont want paper.
1219,Arya,Hot,You can have our horses for that boat outside.But only if you show us    how to work it.
1220,Arya,Gendry,Riders!
1221,Gendry,Hot,"Soldiers,Coming down the river road, a dozen of them."
1222,Arya,Hot,"Theres no  cause for spilling good ale on my floor,Sit back down and calm yourself, boy, theres  rabbit coming."
1223,Arya,Lem,Well keep you safe as best we can.
1224,Arya,Lem,"Well have no more of that, now."
1225,Gendry,Lem,Run!
1226,Gendry,Lem,"Stop it, you little fool,Stop it now!"
1227,Arya,Hullen,Harwin?
1228,Lem,Robb,Harwin!
1229,Harwin,Lem,"Its me,Harwin, its me, dont you know me, dont you?"
1230,Harwin,Lem,"Harwin, its me!"
1231,Arya,Harwin,How do you know me?
1232,Arya,Harwin,"The flayed man ... who are you, some serving boy to Lord Leech?"
1233,Arya,Lem,"Im a girl,I was Lord Boltons cupbearer but he was going to leave me for the  goat, so I ran off with Gendry and Hot Pie."
1234,Arya,Lem,"You used to lead my pony, when I  was little."
1235,Arya,Lem,"Gods be good,Arya Underfoot?Lem, let go of her.She broke my nose."
1236,Harwin,Lem,Who in seven hells is she  supposed to be?The Hands daughter.
1237,Harwin,Lem,"Arya Stark, of Winterfell."
1238,Desmond,Edmure,"Tansy,"
1239,Robb,Vyman,"I am here to see to your father, and only that, my lady,Your  brother will soon be Lord of Riverrun.What he wishes you to know, he must tell you."
1240,Catelyn,Desmond,"King Robb has returned from the west, my lady,and commands that you attend him in  the Great Hall."
1241,Robb,Small,.
1242,Stannis,Tywin,Hed had his fill  of northmen and rivermen both.
1243,Greatjon,Robb,"Make no mistake, though.The  Lannisters will march again, and there will be other battles to win before the kingdom is secure.King in the North!"
1244,Catelyn,Greatjon,King of the Trident!
1245,Brynden,Catelyn,"It is good to see you  home, Cat,And you,Mother."
1246,Catelyn,Rickard,"Your Grace, I have prayed for your safe return.I had heard  you were wounded.I took an arrow through the arm while storming the Crag,Its healed well, though.I had the  best of care.The gods are good, then."
1247,Catelyn,Rickard,"They will have  told you what I did.Did they tell you my reasons?For the girls.I had five children.Now I have three.Aye, my lady."
1248,Catelyn,Greatjon,"And I have one son, who once had  three.You have robbed me of my vengeance."
1249,Catelyn,Greatjon,"Lord Rickard, the Kingslayers dying would  not have bought life for your children.His living may buy life for mine."
1250,Catelyn,Greatjon,Jaime  Lannister has played you for a fool.
1251,Catelyn,Greatjon,"My Torrhen and my  Eddard deserved better of you.Leave off, Karstark,It was a mothers  folly.Women are made that way.A mothers folly?"
1252,Brandon,Robb,I name it treason.Enough.
1253,Bran,Brandon,"No man calls my lady of  Winterfell a traitor in my hearing, Lord Rickard."
1254,Brandon,Catelyn,If I  could wish the Kingslayer back in chains I would.
1255,Greatjon,Rickard,"Dont we, Mother?"
1256,Greatjon,Rickard,"If my heart led me into folly, I would gladly make whatever amends I can to Lord  Karstark and yourself."
1257,Greatjon,Rickard,Will your amends warm Torrhen and Eddard in the cold graves  where the Kingslayer laid them?
1258,Catelyn,Robb,"Forgive him, Mother.If you will forgive me.I have.I know what it is to love so greatly you can think of nothing else."
1259,Catelyn,Robb,Thank you.
1260,Robb,Utherydes,"We must talk,You and my uncles."
1261,Robb,Utherydes,"Steward, call an end."
1262,Galbart,Robb,"My lady, if Cersei Lannister held two of my  daughters, I would have done the same."
1263,Galbart,Jason,"Your wolf pup mauled the Kingslayer once, hell do it  again if need be."
1264,Jon,Robb,"I pray for your girls as well, Cat.I hope you do not doubt that. Of course not."
1265,Catelyn,Robb,I love you for it.
1266,Catelyn,Robb,"My lady, sers, are you new to  my sons cause? New,but fierce in our courage and firm in our loyalties,  as I hope to prove to you, my lady."
1267,Catelyn,Robb,"Mother, may I present the Lady Sybell, the wife of Lord  Gawen Westerling of the Crag."
1268,Catelyn,Robb,Her husband was  one of those we took captive in the Whispering Wood.
1269,Catelyn,Robb,"Ser Rolph Spicer, Lady Sybells brother.He  was castellan at the Crag when we took it."
1270,Catelyn,Robb,The children of Lord  Gawen and Lady Sybell.Ser Raynald Westerling.
1271,Catelyn,Robb,Elenya.
1272,Catelyn,Robb,"Rollarn Westerling, my squire."
1273,Catelyn,Robb,"The honor is mine,"
1274,Jeyne,Robb,"Mother,I have the great  honor to present you the Lady Jeyne Westerling."
1275,Catelyn,Jeyne,"I have a new daughter,"
1276,Jeyne,Robb,"Be welcome to our hall and hearth.Thank you, my lady."
1277,Jeyne,Robb,And as wise a queen as I can.
1278,Robb,Sybell,"We are honored to be joined to House Stark, my  lady, but we are also very weary."
1279,Jeyne,Robb,"Perhaps we might retire to  our chambers, so you may visit with your son?That would be best."
1280,Edmure,Jeyne,"The steward will find you suitable accommodations.Ill take you to him,You are most kind,Must I go too?"
1281,Robb,Rollam,Im your squire.
1282,Robb,Rollam,"But Im not in need of squiring just now.Oh.His Grace has gotten along for sixteen years without you, Rollam,He will survive a few hours more, I think."
1283,Jason,Raynald,"Your wife is lovely,and the Westerlings seem worthy ...  though Lord Gawen is Tywin Lannisters sworn man, is he not?Yes."
1284,Martyn,Perwyn,"For love of me, Jeyne may lose all.And you,have lost the Freys."
1285,Martyn,Robb,"Dare I ask how many swords come with your bride, Robb?Fifty.A dozen knights."
1286,Robb,Walder,Jeyne is bright as well as beautiful.
1287,Robb,Walder,She has a gentle heart.
1288,Small,Walder,"Tell me how this came to be.I took her castle and she took my heart., Robb smiled.The Crag was weakly garrisoned, so we took  it by storm one night."
1289,Catelyn,Greatjon,Bran and  Rickon.
1290,Catelyn,Jeyne,"That night, she ... she comforted me,  Mother."
1291,Catelyn,Jeyne,And you  wed her the next day.
1292,Balon,Jeyne,"It was the only honorable thing to do.Shes  gentle and sweet, Mother, she will make me a good wife.Perhaps.That will not appease Lord Frey.I know,Ive made a botch of everything but the battles, havent I?I thought the  battles would be the hard part, but ... if I had listened to you and kept Theon as my hostage, Id still rule  the north, and Bran and Rickon would be alive and safe in Winterfell.Perhaps."
1293,Balon,Robb,He might have thought it a bargain to lose only one this time.
1294,Balon,Robb,"What  happened with the Freys, after you wed?"
1295,Robb,Stevron,"With Ser Stevron, I might have been able to make amends, but Ser Ryman is  dull-witted as a stone, and Black Walder ... that one was not named for the color of his beard, I promise  you."
1296,Olyvar,Stevron,"I would have killed  him for that if Jeyne had not begged me to be merciful.You have done House Frey a grievous insult, Robb.I never meant to."
1297,Greatjon,Ryman,. Fighting your own in the midst of your enemies?
1298,Greatjon,Walder,It would have been the end of you.Yes.
1299,Catelyn,Walder,   said Catelyn.
1300,Catelyn,Robb,"Not only have you broken your oath, but youve slighted  the honor of the Twins by choosing a bride from a lesser house."
1301,Catelyn,Robb,The Westerlings are better blood than the Freys.
1302,Catelyn,Robb,"The Kings of the Rock sometimes wed Westerlings before the Conquest,  and there was another Jeyne Westerling who was queen to King Maegor three hundred years ago.All of which will only salt Lord Walders wounds."
1303,Catelyn,Robb,"Jon Arryn was  disinclined to foster his grandsons, and my father refused the offer of one of his daughters for Edmure."
1304,Catelyn,Robb,"Your Grace,perhaps we had best continue this in private.Yes."
1305,Catelyn,Robb,"I would kill for a cup of wine.The audience chamber, I think."
1306,Catelyn,Robb,"Robb, where is Grey Wind?In the yard, with a haunch of mutton.I told the kennelmaster to see that he was fed.You always kept him with you before.A hall is no place for a wolf."
1307,Catelyn,Robb,"Jeynes anxious around him,  and he terrifies her mother."
1308,Catelyn,Robb,"He is part of you, Robb.To fear him is to fear you.I am not a wolf, no matter what they call me."
1309,Catelyn,Robb,"Grey Wind killed a man at the  Crag, another at Ashemark, and six or seven at Oxcross.   she said sharply, "
1310,Jeyne,Robb,He bares his teeth every time Ser Rolph comes  near him.
1311,Jeyne,Robb,Send Ser Rolph away.At once.Where?
1312,Jeyne,Robb,I am not going to banish    him just because my wolf doesnt seem to like the way he smells.Robb.
1313,Jeyne,Robb,"I told you once to keep Theon Greyjoy close, and you did not  listen."
1314,Jeyne,Robb,"Find some task that  requires a man of courage, some honorable duty, what it is matters not ... but do not keep him near you."
1315,Jeyne,Robb,Should I have Grey Wind sniff all my knights?There might be others whose smell he  mislikes.Any man Grey Wind mislikes is a man I do not want close to you.
1316,Robb,Theon,"Five wolf pups, Robb, five for five Stark children.Six,There was a wolf for Jon as well."
1317,Robb,Theon,.Until?
1318,Rickon,Small,"Im a king, and I can protect myself."
1319,Catelyn,Small,"I will  find some duty for Ser Rolph, some pretext to send him away."
1320,Catelyn,Small,You have suffered enough.
1321,Brynden,Edmure,"I  think weve all heard sufficient of your boasting, Nephew."
1322,Brynden,Edmure,"Boasting?What do you mean?I mean,"
1323,Edmure,Robb,"Had it been me I  would have flayed you for your stupidity rather than praising this folly of the fords.Good men died to defend those fords, Uncle."
1324,Edmure,Robb,"What, is no one to win  victories but the Young Wolf?Did I steal some glory meant for you, Robb?Your Grace,You took me for your king, Uncle.or have you forgotten that as  well?You were commanded to hold Riverrun, Edmure, no more.I held Riverrun, and I bloodied Lord Tywins nose   said Robb."
1325,Brynden,Robb,"You knew I did not have enough men to    threaten Lannisport or Casterly Rock.Why ... there were other castles ... gold, cattle...You think we stayed for plunder?"
1326,Brynden,Robb,"Uncle, I wanted Lord Tywin to come west.We were all horsed,The Lannister host was mainly foot."
1327,Edmure,Robb,"All the while we would  have lived off his land, instead of him living off ours.Lord Stannis was about to fall upon Kings Landing,He might have rid us of Joffrey, the  queen, and the Imp in one red stroke.Then we might have been able to make a peace."
1328,Edmure,Robb,"You never told me.I told you to hold Riverrun, What part of that command did you fail to comprehend?When you stopped Lord Tywin on the Red Fork,"
1329,Catelyn,Renly,"They floated down the river, disembarked half a days  ride from the city, and took Stannis in the rear."
1330,Brienne,Qyburn,"I never meant ... never, Robb, you must let me make amends."
1331,Catelyn,Robb,"The next battle,Well, that will be soon enough."
1332,Catelyn,Walder,"So long as Theon Greyjoy sits in your fathers seat with your brothers blood on his hands, these other  foes must wait,Your first duty is to defend your own people, win back Winterfell,  and hang Theon in a crows cage to die slowly.Or else put off that crown for good, Robb, for men will  know that you are no true king at all."
1333,Robb,Theon,"When they told me Winterfell had fallen, I wanted to go north at once,I wanted to free Bran and Rickon, but I thought ..."
1334,Catelyn,Robb,     Catelyn said. said Robb.
1335,Catelyn,Edmure,"I cant  ask the river lords to abandon their own people.No,Leave them to guard their own, and win back the north with northmen.How will you get the northmen to the north?"
1336,Catelyn,Edmure,The ironmen control the  sunset sea.
1337,Robb,Walder,"We could be trapped on the causeway, with the ironborn before us  and angry Freys at our backs.We must win back the Freys,With them, we still have some chance of success, however  small."
1338,Catelyn,Walder,   said Catelyn.
1339,Jon,Tormund,Big enough for you?
1340,Jon,Tormund,Was that their king?
1341,Jon,Mag,"Giants have no kings, no moren mammoths do, nor snow bears, nor the great whales o the grey sea."
1342,Mag,Tormund,"Giants have bad eyes, and might be he wouldnt see some little crow all the way down there  by his feet.What did you say to him?Was that the Old Tongue?Aye.I asked him if that was his father he was forking, they looked so much alike, except his father had  a better smell.And what did he say to you?"
1343,Jon,Tormund,"He asked me if that was my daughter riding there  beside me, with her smooth pink cheeks."
1344,Jon,Tormund,it may be he never saw a man without a beard before.
1345,Jon,Tormund,Mance grows sore  wroth when Im not found in my accustomed place.
1346,Jon,Tormund,Is it true  you killed a giant once?
1347,Jon,Tormund,Now why would you doubt a mighty man like me?
1348,Jon,Mance,"Theres times I miss the taste o giants milk, though.If she nursed you, you couldnt have killed her.I never did, but see you dont go spreading that about.Tormund Giantsbane has a better ring to it than  Tormund Giantsbabe, and thats the honest truth o it.So how did you come by your other names?"
1349,Jon,Mance,"Mance called you the Horn-Blower, didnt  he?Mead-king of Ruddy Hall, Husband to Bears, Father to Hosts?"
1350,Joramun,Tormund,Are all crows so curious?
1351,Joramun,Tormund,"Well, heres a tale for you."
1352,Chett,Jacelyn,"The more I drank the more I thought about her, and the more I thought the harder me member got, till I  couldnt suffer it no more."
1353,Chett,Jacelyn,"The woman had a terrible temper, and she put up quite the fight when I laid hands on her."
1354,Jon,Tormund,Har! 
1355,Jon,Tormund,Would that I could find her again.
1356,Jon,Tormund,"Never was a woman gave me such a fight, nor such strong sons neither.What could you do if you did find her?"
1357,Jon,Tormund,You said she bit your member off.Only half.And half me member is twice as long as any other mans.
1358,Jon,Tormund,"Now as to you  ... is it true they cut your members off when they take you for the Wall?No,I think it must be true."
1359,Jon,Ygritte,"The  girl wants you in her, thats plain enough to see."
1360,Jon,Rattleshirt,"crow-come-over,"
1361,Rattleshirt,Tormund,"Free folk  ride with who they want,and we had a bellyful of Bag o Bones."
1362,Jon,Ygritte,"Cold is better,if youve got someone to warm you up after."
1363,Jon,Tormund,Youd freeze me to death.Are all crows afraid of gooseprickles?
1364,Jon,Tormund,Ill jump in with you tprove it so.And ride the rest of the day with wet clothes frozen to our skins?
1365,Jon,Tormund,"Jon Snow, you know nothing.You dont go in with clothes.I dont go in at all,"
1366,Jon,Tormund,Do you mislike the girl?
1367,Jon,Tormund,"No, but I...I am still too young to wed.Wed?"
1368,Jon,Tormund,"Who spoke of wedding?In the south, must a man wed every girl he beds?"
1369,Jon,Tormund,"She spoke for me when Rattleshirt would have killed me.I  would not dishonor her.You are a free man now, and Ygritte is a free woman.What dishonor if you lay together?I might get her with child.Aye, Id hope so.A strong son or a lively laughing girl kissed by fire, and wheres the harm in that?"
1370,Jon,Ygritte,"The boy ... the child would be a bastard.Are bastards weaker than other children?More sickly, more like to fail? No, but -  "
1371,Tormund,Ygritte,"You do not come into it, once the seed is planted.I will not father a bastard."
1372,Tormund,Ygritte,What fools you kneelers be.Why did you steal the girl if you dont  want her?Steal?   said Tormund.
1373,Jon,Small,"Well, you are a free man now, but if you will not have the girl, best find  yourself a she-bear.If a man does not use his member it grows smaller and smaller, until one day he  wants to piss and cannot find it."
1374,Jon,Qhorin,"Ride with them, eat with them, fight with  them,And watch."
1375,Jon,Ygritte,"So,dyou believe us now, Jon Snow?"
1376,Jon,Ryk,The crows in love!He means to marry one!A giantess?
1377,Ryk,Tormund,"No, a mammoth!"
1378,Tormund,Ygritte,Har!
1379,Arya,Stonesnake,spearwifespearwife
1380,Tormund,Ygritte,"Do you know The Last of the Giants?You need a  deeper voice than mine to do it proper.Ooooooh, I am the last of the giants, my people  are gone from the earth."
1381,Ryk,Tormund,"The last of the great mountain giants, who ruled all  the world at my birth,Oh, the smallfolk have stolen my forests, theyve stolen my rivers and  hills.And theyve built a great wall through my valleys, and fished all the fish from my rills,"
1382,Jon,Ygritte,Why are you weeping?
1383,Jon,Ygritte,"It was only a song.There are hundreds of giants, Ive just seen  them.Oh, hundreds,You know nothing, Jon Snow.You - fON!"
1384,Tormund,Ygritte,"My eye,Its only blood, Jon Snow.He missed the eye, just ripped your skin up some."
1385,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Bag o Bones,call off your hellcrow!Theres your hellcrow!"
1386,Jon,Rattleshirt,Bleeding in the mud like a faithless dog!
1387,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Im here for him.Come take him then,"
1388,Tormund,Ygritte,"Har!Once I prick you and let the air out, youll shrink down smallern that girl.Stand aside, or Mance will  hear o this."
1389,Tormund,Ygritte,"What, is it Mance who wants him?I said so, didnt I?Get him up on those black feet."
1390,Jon,Ygritte,"Best go, if its the Mance whos wanting you."
1391,Jon,Ygritte,Hes bleeding like a butchered boar.Look what Orell did t his sweet face.
1392,Jon,Ygritte,"Ill come,"
1393,Jon,Ygritte,Let me catch my garron.
1394,Rattleshirt,Ygritte,I am coming too.Be gone.
1395,Rattleshirt,Ygritte,"I was sent for the  crow-come-down, none other.A free woman rides where she will,"
1396,Jon,Ygritte,"Are we  talking or riding?Riding,"
1397,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Up,Mance is up top."
1398,Jon,Ygritte,What happened to your face? Orell tried to take his eye out.It was him I asked.
1399,Mag,Styr,"Perhaps he should, to spare us further lies."
1400,Mag,Styr,"The boy might see more clear with one eye, instead of two.Would you like to keep your eye, Jon?"
1401,Jon,Mance,"If so, tell me how many they  were.And try and speak the truth this time, Bastard of Winterfell."
1402,Jon,Mance,"My lord ... what...I am not your lord,And the what is plain enough."
1403,Jon,Mance,"The question is,  how many?"
1404,Mance,Qhorin,There were three hundred of us.Us?
1405,Harma,Mance,Them.Three hundred of them.
1406,Harma,Mance,"Two hundred from Castle Black, and one hundred from the Shadow Tower.Theres a truer song than the one you sang in my tent."
1407,Harma,Mance,"How many  horses have we found?Moren a hundred,less than two."
1408,Mance,Ryk,"You should never have lied to me, Jon Snow,I ...I know that."
1409,Ryk,Small,Who had the command here?
1410,Harma,Small,Whose tent was this?
1411,Harma,Small,You did not find his body?
1412,Jon,Mance,"What fools these black crows be.The next time you answer me with a question, I will give you to my Lord of Bones,"
1413,Jon,Mance,Who led here?
1414,Mance,Ygritte,"Reach up for that bastard sword and Ill have your bastard head off before it clears the scabbard,I am fast losing patience with you, crow.Say it,Hes dead, whoever he was."
1415,Harma,Jon,The Old Bear.That old man?
1416,Harma,Jon,He came himself ?Then who commands at  Castle Black?Bowen Marsh.
1417,Jon,Mance,"If so, our war is won.Bowen knows a deal more about counting swords than hes ever  known about using them.The Old Bear commanded,This place was high and strong, and he made it stronger."
1418,Jon,Mance,. .
1419,Jon,Mance,me?
1420,Jon,Mance,"Aye, he was.Had I been fool enough to storm this hill, I might have  lost five men for every crow I slew and still counted myself lucky."
1421,Jon,Mance,"But when the  dead walk, walls and stakes and swords mean nothing."
1422,Jon,Mance,No man  knows that half so well as me.
1423,Jon,Ygritte,"Styr, Jarl, you ride at first light.Mance,I want me some crow bones."
1424,Jon,Styr,"You cant kill a man for lying to protect them as was his brothers.They are still his brothers,Theyre not,He never killed me, like they told him.And he slew the Halfhand, we all  saw."
1425,Jarl,Ygritte,"I wear the cloak you gave me, Your Grace.A sheepskin cloak!"
1426,Jarl,Ygritte,"And theres many a night we dance beneath it, too!"
1427,Harma,Mance,"Is that the way of it, Jon Snow?"
1428,Jon,Mance,Her and you?
1429,Jarl,Mance,"Yes,"
1430,Jarl,Mance,Good.
1431,Jon,Mag,Far be it from  me to separate two hearts that beat as one.Go where?
1432,Jon,Mag,"Over the Wall.Its past time you proved your faith with something more than words, Jon Snow."
1433,Jon,Mag,"What do I want with a crow?He knows the Watch and he knows the Wall,and he knows Castle Black better than  any raider ever could."
1434,Mance,Styr,His heart may still be black.Then cut it out.
1435,Mance,Rattleshirt,"My Lord of Bones, keep the column moving at all costs.If we reach the Wall before Mon mont, weve won.Theyll move."
1436,Craster,Qhorin,
1437,Jon,Rattleshirt,"You look a bloody mess.I will,You best not be lying, girl,"
1438,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Get away from us, unless you want what Qhorin got.You got no wolf to help you here, boy."
1439,Rattleshirt,Ygritte,"Sure o that, are you?"
1440,Jon,Ygritte,"I never asked you to lie for me.I never did,I left out part, is all.You said -  - that we fuck beneath your cloak many a night."
1441,Mance,Sansa,"Find another place for Ghost to sleep tonight, Jon Snow."
1442,Mance,Sansa,Deeds is truer than words.A new gown?
1443,Mance,Sansa,"More lovely than any you have worn, my lady,"
1444,Margaery,Sansa,"All silk and Myrish lace, with satin linings."
1445,Joffrey,Margaery,The  queen herself has commanded it.Which queen?
1446,Renly,Sansa,"The Queen Regent, to be sure.Queen Cersei?None other.She has honored me with her custom for many a year."
1447,Renly,Sansa,"Her Grace said to me that you are a woman now, and should not dress  like a little girl.Hold out your arm."
1448,Renly,Sansa,"Your bosom will be as lovely as the queens,You should not hide it so."
1449,Margaery,Sansa,What color will it be?
1450,Margaery,Sansa,"Leave the colors to me, my lady."
1451,Margaery,Sansa,"You shall have smallclothes and  hose as well, kirtles and mantles and cloaks, and all else befitting a ... a lovely young lady of noble birth.Will they be ready in time for the kings wedding?Oh, sooner, much sooner, Her Grace insists."
1452,Margaery,Sansa,"Many ladies will be cross with us, but it was the queens  command.Thank Her Grace kindly for her thoughtfulness,She is too good to me.Her Grace is most generous,"
1453,Elinor,Megga,"Roses from lower on the bush,"
1454,Joffrey,Sansa,"King Joffrey has such beautiful lips,oh, poor Sansa, how your heart must  have broken when you lost him."
1455,Elinor,Megga,"Alyn said her favor made him fearless,He  says he shouted her name for his battle cry, isnt that ever so gallant?Someday I want some champion to  wear my favor, and kill a hundred men."
1456,Margaery,Sansa,"Willas has the best birds in the Seven Kingdoms,He flies an eagle sometimes.You will see, Sansa."
1457,Margaery,Sansa,Sister.
1458,Joffrey,Margaery,"Margaery, please,you  mustnt."
1459,Joffrey,Margaery,You mustnt marry him.
1460,Joffrey,Margaery,Hell  hurt you.I shouldnt think so.
1461,Joffrey,Margaery,"Its brave of you to warn me, but you need not fear."
1462,Aemon,Loras,"So our little lion had best  behave, hadnt    he?Come, sweet sister, lets race back to the river."
1463,Florian,Willas,You cannot!
1464,Florian,Sansa,"I tell you, these Tyrells are only Lannisters with flowers."
1465,Florian,Sansa,"The night  of Joffreys wedding, thats not so long, wear the silver hair net and do as I told you, and afterward we  make our escape."
1466,Dontos,Sansa,I wont.
1467,Dontos,Sansa,"When I wanted to escape you wouldnt take me, and now I dont need to."
1468,Dontos,Jon,"But the arrangements are made, sweetling.The ship to take you home,  the boat to take you to the ship, your Florian did it all for his sweet Jonquil.I am sorry for all the trouble I put you to,but I have no need of boats and ships now.But its all to see you safe.I will be safe in Highgarden.Willas will keep me safe.But he does not know you,"
1469,Jon,Sansa,  
1470,Jon,Sansa,"Sweetling,you are heir to Winterfell."
1471,Loras,Willas,"Willas, Willas,  Willas."
1472,Arya,Gendry,"Were going the wrong way,Were going south.See how the moss is growing on the trunk?Were following the road, thats all."
1473,Arya,Gendry,"I think  were lost,We shouldnt have left the river.All we had to do was follow it.The river bends and loops,This is just a shorter way, I bet."
1474,Arya,Gendry,Lem and Tom and them have been living here for years.
1475,Arya,Gendry,"But the moss...The way its raining, well have moss growing from our ears before long,Only from our south ear,"
1476,Arya,Hot,"Shama says she needs me to bake bread,Anyhow Im tired of rain  and saddlesores and being scared all the time."
1477,Arya,Hot,"When the wars  done?My lady,"
1478,Arya,Hot,"Im sorry I beat you that time,"
1479,Arya,Hot,I broke your nose.You broke Lems too.
1480,Arya,Hot,"That was good.Lem didnt think so,"
1481,Arya,Hot,"Dont call me that.Youre Hot Pie, and Im Arry.Im not Hot Pie here."
1482,Harwin,Hullen,its going to be  confusing.
1483,Arya,Yoren,"He always said hed die in a stable,but we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would  be his death, not a pack of lions."
1484,Beric,Tickler,"Valar morghulis,Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."
1485,Beric,Tickler,"Ser  Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei, King Joffrey."
1486,Harwin,Tywin,"It was a trap, milady."
1487,Arya,Jory,"Only the Kingslayer never knew Lord  Tywins plan, and when he heard about his brothers capture he attacked your father in the streets of  Kings Landing.I remember,He killed Jory."
1488,Eddard,Jory,"He killed Jory,"
1489,Gregor,Wyl,I saw the Mountain slay Raymun Darry with a single blow so terrible that it took Darrys arm off at the  elbow and killed the horse beneath him too.
1490,Beric,Thoros,Every man of us was certain his lordship would be dead by daybreak.
1491,Gregor,Tywin,By then the fighting had passed by us.
1492,Cersei,Eddard,That turned the whole world on its head.
1493,Arya,Harwin,Dogs?
1494,Arya,Harwin,Aye.
1495,Arya,Harwin,"One of our lads keeps the meanest dogs youd ever want to see.I wish I had a good mean dog,A lion-killing dog."
1496,Arya,Lem,"There were men through here not two days past, looking for the Kingslayer,Theyd do better looking in Riverrun.Down in the deepest dungeons, where its nice and  damp."
1497,Arya,Lem,"No,Hes escaped."
1498,Arya,Greenbeard,Could that be true?
1499,Arya,Greenbeard,"Ill not believe it,"
1500,Arya,Greenbeard,Ive had me a taste o them  dungeons.How could he escape? 
1501,Craster,Qhorin,
1502,Anguy,Thoros,"The Lord of Light  will show him Lannister in the flames.Theres a fine fire burning here,"
1503,Greenbeard,Lem,"Do I look a priest to you, Archer?When Pello of  Tyrosh peers into the fire, the cinders singe his beard."
1504,Beric,Jaime,".Would he hang him, Lem?"
1505,Anguy,Jaime,Itd be half a shame to hang a man as  pretty as that one.A trial first!
1506,Anguy,Jaime,"Lord Beric always gives them a trial, you know that."
1507,Anguy,Jaime,Then he  hangs them.
1508,Arya,Gendry,We are going the wrong way!
1509,Arya,Gendry,"What is it, moss again?Look at the sun,Were going south!"
1510,Arya,Gendry,We should never have left the Trident.See.
1511,Arya,Lem,"See, theres Riverrun, between the rivers.As it happens,we know where Riverrun is."
1512,Greenbeard,Lem,"Ah, dont look so hurt, child,No harm will come to you, you have my word  on that.The word of a liar!No one lied,We made no promises.Its not for us to say whats to be done with you."
1513,Arya,Greenbeard,"Take me to Riverrun and youll be rewarded,Little one,a peasant may skin a common squirrel for his pot, but if he finds a  gold squirrel in his tree he takes it to his lord, or he will wish he did.Im not a squirrel,You are."
1514,Arya,Greenbeard,"A little gold squirrel whos off to see the lightning lord, whether she    wills it or not."
1515,Beric,Greenbeard,"Ill wager he sends you back to your lady mother,  just as you wish."
1516,Arya,Beric,"Aye, thats like Lord Beric.Hell do right by you, see if he dont."
1517,Anguy,Arya,Why do I have to see Lord Beric?
1518,Anguy,Arya,"We bring him all our highbom captives,"
1519,Arya,Lem,"Swift as  a deer,Run, now, run."
1520,Greenbeard,Lem,"Faster,you can, you can."
1521,Harwin,Lyanna,"You ride like a  northman, milady,Your aunt was the same."
1522,Harwin,Lyanna,"But my father was master of horse, remember."
1523,Hullen,Lyanna,"I thought you were my fathers man.Lord Eddards dead, milady.I belong to the lightning lord now, and to my brothers.What brothers?"
1524,Arya,Robb,"Anguy, Lem, Tom o Sevens, Jack and Greenbeard, all of them."
1525,Hot,Robb,The smallfolk have only us.
1526,Hot,Robb,Can you  understand what I am telling you?Yes.
1527,Nan,Weasel,"Will you ride back peaceful now,or must I tie you up and throw you across your  horse?Ill ride peaceful,"
1528,Beric,Harren,I knew a man once who  wore his sword on a chain around his neck like that.
1529,Dick,Grenn,"Mother have mercy,Mother have  mercy, Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy."
1530,Dick,Grenn,"Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy."
1531,Chett,Dick,"Mercy,oh, mercy, mercy me, mercy me."
1532,Chett,Samwell,"Back on your feet, Piggy,"
1533,Aemon,Samwell,Youre no fighter.
1534,Dick,Samwell,"Write it out yourself, and send one  bird to Castle Black and another to the Shadow Tower."
1535,Dick,Samwell,"I dont care if youre so scared you foul your breeches, and I dont care if a thousand  wildlings are coming over the walls howling for your blood, you get those birds off, or I swear Ill hunt  you through all seven hells and make you damn sorry that you didnt.Sorry, sorry, sorry."
1536,Chett,Samwell,"Help me get the birds off,"
1537,Chett,Samwell,Fly!
1538,Grenn,Samwell,"Here they come,Notch,Gods be good, theres hundreds,Draw,hold."
1539,Chett,Samwell,"Hold,hold, hold.Loose."
1540,Chett,Samwell,"Theyre not stopping,  mlord,More!Look there, coming from the trees, Gods ha mercy, theys crawling."
1541,Dick,Samwell,"Fire arrows,give them flame."
1542,Dick,Samwell,Tarly!
1543,Dick,Samwell,Your  place is with the ravens.I ...
1544,Dick,Samwell,I got the messages away.Good.
1545,Dick,Samwell,Youre in the way here.
1546,Chett,Samwell,See that the birds are ready.Fire!
1547,Lem,Sandor,"Notch, draw ..."
1548,Dywen,Samwell,"Bum, you dead bastards, bum,"
1549,Dywen,Samwell,Theyre still coming.
1550,Dywen,Samwell,"Spears,"
1551,Chett,Samwell,"Loose, loose, loose,Bloody huge,A giant!A bear, a bear!"
1552,Craster,Gilly,"Get up,Samwell you cant go to sleep here.Get up and keep  walking."
1553,Grenn,Samwell,"Go away,Im well.I  want to rest.Get up."
1554,Grenn,Samwell,"Theres  no resting, the Old Bear said.Youll die.Grenn."
1555,Grenn,Samwell,"No, truly, Im good here."
1556,Grenn,Samwell,Ill catch you after Ive rested a bit  longer.You wont.
1557,Grenn,Samwell,"Youll freeze, or the Others will get you.Samwell get up!"
1558,Alliser,Samwell,"Aurochs,Ser PiggyLord Snow"
1559,Grenn,Samwell,"Leave him,If they cant walk, theyre done.Save your strength for  yourself, Grenn.Hell get up,He only needs a hand."
1560,Grenn,Samwell,"That hurts,Stop it."
1561,Grenn,Samwell,Stop it.Youre too bloody heavy.
1562,Grenn,Samwell,Get up!
1563,Grenn,Samwell,Get up and walk.You have to walk.
1564,Grenn,Samwell,"if you take the torch, I can take the fat boy."
1565,Grenn,Small,Can you carry him?
1566,Grenn,Small,I carried a calf once was heavier than him.I carried him down to his mother so he could get a drink of  milk.
1567,Grenn,Small,"Stop it,put me  down, Im not a baby."
1568,Grenn,Small,"Just let me die.Be quiet, SamwellSave your strength."
1569,Aemon,Samwell,Sing a song if you like.Aloud?In your head.
1570,Craster,Qhorin,"I dont know any songs, Grenn. said Grenn."
1571,Grenn,Samwell,"All black and brown and covered with hair!No, not that one,"
1572,Samwell,Small,"No songs.Please, Grerm.Think about your ravens, then.They were never mine."
1573,Samwell,Small,They belonged to Castle Black and the Shadow Tower.
1574,Samwell,Small,"Chett said I could have the Old Bears raven, the one that talks.I saved food for it  and everything."
1575,Samwell,Small,"I forgot, though.I left the food where I hid it."
1576,Samwell,Small,"Id never let Lark eat it.Theyre gone,Im sorry."
1577,Samwell,Small,Theyre flying back to the Wall now.
1578,Chett,Samwell,"No,oh, no, oh, no."
1579,Small,Thoren,"Samwellwould you wake me, please?"
1580,Small,Thoren,"Theyre over the west wall, mlord,Ill send reserves."
1581,Small,Thoren,.NO!
1582,Samwell,Small,"Call them back, we  have to cut our way out."
1583,Samwell,Small,Spearhead!
1584,Samwell,Small,"Form wedge, we ride.Down the south face, then east!My lord, the south slopes crawling with them!The others are too steep,We have -  His garron screamed and reared and almost threw him as the bear came staggering through the snow."
1585,Samwell,Small,RIDE!
1586,Samwell,Small,"Youre falling  behind,"
1587,Samwell,Small,"No ones like to wait for you, Paul.Leave the pig for the dead  men.He promised I could have a bird,"
1588,Grenn,Samwell,"I want me a bird that talks, and eats corn from my hand.Bloody fool,"
1589,Grenn,Small,"Were alone,I cant see the other torches.Was that the rear guard? "
1590,Samwell,Small,"I cant carry you no more.I would, but I cant."
1591,Grenn,Samwell,Who goes there?
1592,Samwell,Small,Whyd you hurt that horse?That was  Mawneys horse.
1593,Grenn,Samwell,Get away!
1594,Grenn,Samwell,"Away, or you bum."
1595,Samwell,Small,"Mother have mercy,Father protect  me, oh oh ."
1596,Samwell,Small,. 
1597,Alliser,Samwell,"Oh,"
1598,Grenn,Samwell,"Mother, thats  cold.Obsidian."
1599,Grenn,Samwell,"Dragonglass, they call it."
1600,Grenn,Samwell,Dragon glass.
1601,Grenn,Samwell,"You keep it,Youre not craven like me.So craven you killed an Other."
1602,Grenn,Samwell,"Look there, through the trees."
1603,Grenn,Samwell,"If we head that way, we should catch Mormont.If you say."
1604,Tyrion,Tywin,Ill try.
1605,Tyrion,Tywin,Ill try hard.
1606,Renly,Tyrion,"That chain of yours, that was cunning,Quite so, quite so, my lord of Highgarden speaks for all of us,"
1607,Craster,Qhorin,"Lancel has told me  how brave you were, Tyrion."
1608,Meera,Rickon,My good cousin is  too kind.
1609,Cersei,Kevan,"One day he seems stronger, the next ... it is worrisome.Your sister often visits his  sickbed, to lift his spirits and pray for him."
1610,Rowan,Tywin,Shall we  begin with the wedding arrangements?
1611,Randyll,Tywin,"No,With the war.Varys."
1612,Randyll,Tywin,"I have such delicious tidings for you all, my lords."
1613,Joffrey,Paxter,"Robett Glover leads the survivors back toward Harrenhal in bloody  disarray, little dreaming he will find valiant Ser Gregor and his stalwarts athwart his path.Gods be praised!"
1614,Joffrey,Paxter,A great victory for King Joffrey! 
1615,Robb,Tyrion,"And a terrible defeat for the north, certainly,yet one in which Robb Stark  played no part."
1616,Rowan,Tywin,"He has run back to Riverrun with his plunder, abandoning the castles he took in the west,Our cousin Ser Daven is reforming the remnants of his late fathers army at Lannisport."
1617,Forley,Rowan,"As  soon as the Stark boy starts north, Ser Forley and Ser Daven will descend on Riverrun.You are certain Lord Stark means to go north?"
1618,Mace,Rowan,Even with the ironmen at Moat  Cailin?
1619,Mace,Rowan,Is there anything as pointless as a king without a kingdom?
1620,Robb,Tyrion,That is what I would do.
1621,Eddard,Petyr,"I ought to write Robb Stark a stern letter,I understand his man Bolton is  stabling goats in my high hall, its really quite unconscionable."
1622,Cersei,Kevan,"As regards the Starks ... Balon Greyjoy, who now styles  himself King of the Isles and the North, has written to us offering terms of alliance.He ought to be offering fealty,By what right does he call himself king?By right of conquest,King Balon has stranglers fingers round the Neck."
1623,Mathis,Rowan,"King Balons longships command the sunset sea, and are well placed to menace  Lannisport, Fair Isle, and even Highgarden, should we provoke him.And if we accept this alliance?"
1624,Mathis,Rowan,What terms does he propose?That we recognize his kingship and grant him everything north of the Neck.
1625,Mace,Rowan,"What is there north of the Neck that any sane man would want?If Greyjoy will  trade swords and sails for stone and snow, I say do it, and count ourselves lucky.Truly,Thats what I would do.Let King Balon finish the northmen whilst we  finish Stannis."
1626,Mace,Tywin,"There is Lysa Arryn to deal with as well.Jon Arryns  widow, Hoster Tullys daughter, Catelyn Starks sister ... whose husband was conspiring with Stannis  Baratheon at the time of his death.Oh,women have no stomach for war. said Redwyne."
1627,Tyrion,Tywin,"She did throw mein a cell andputme on trial for mylife,Nor has she returned to Kings Landing to swear fealty to Joffrey, as she was  commanded.My lords, grant me the men, and I will sort out Lysa Arryn."
1628,Mace,Tyrion,"Perhaps youd best leave the  fighting to fighters,Better men than you have lost great armies in the  Mountains of the Moon, or shattered them against the Bloody Gate.We know your worth, my lord, no    need to tempt fate."
1629,Rowan,Tyrion,"I have other  tasks in mind for Tyrion.I believe Lord Petyr may hold the key to the Eyrie.Oh, I do,I have it here between my legs."
1630,Petyr,Rowan,"My lords, with your leave, I propose to travel to the Vale and there woo and win Lady Lysa Arryn.Once I am her consort, I shall deliver you the Vale of Arryn without a drop of blood being spilled."
1631,Petyr,Rowan,"Would Lady Lysa have you?Shes had me a few times before, Lord Mathis, and voiced no complaints.Bedding,is not wedding."
1632,Petyr,Tyrion,"Now, though ... a match between the Lady of the Eyrie and the Lord of  Harrenhal is not so unthinkable, is it?"
1633,Mace,Paxter,"It might serve,if you are certain that you can keep the woman loyal to the Kings Grace.My lords,autumn is upon us, and all men of good heart are weary of  war."
1634,Mace,Tyrion,"Jon Arryns son is Lord of the Eyrie now.The Lord Robert.Only a boy,I will see that he grows to be Joffreys most loyal subject, and a fast  friend to us all."
1635,Kevan,Tyrion,"We have no lack of foes,If the Eyrie can be kept out of the war, all to the  good.I am of a mind to see what Lord Petyr can accomplish."
1636,Petyr,Tyrion,"How will the crown pay its debts without Lord Petyr?He is our wizard of coin, and we have no  one to replace him."
1637,Petyr,Tyrion,My little friend is too kind.
1638,Robert,Tyrion,"Any clever tradesman could do as well ... and a Lannister, blessed with the golden touch of Casterly  Rock, will no doubt far surpass me.A Lannister?"
1639,Kevan,Tywin,"You are admirably suited to the task, I  believe.Indeed!"
1640,Kevan,Tywin,"Ive no doubt youll make a splendid master of coin, Tyrion."
1641,Petyr,Tywin,"If Lysa Arryn will take you for a husband and return to the  kings peace, we shall restore the Lord Robert to the honor of Warden of the East.How soon might you  leave?On the morrow, if the winds permit."
1642,Mace,Petyr,"Ill see her captain about a berth.You will miss the kings wedding,"
1643,Mace,Petyr,"Tides and brides wait on no man, my lord."
1644,Mace,Petyr,Drowning would definitely diminish my charms as a  bridegroom.
1645,Mace,Petyr,"True.Best you do not linger.May the gods speed you on your way,All Kings Landing shall pray for your  success."
1646,Mace,Petyr,May we return to the matter of the Greyjoy alliance?
1647,Mace,Petyr,"Greyjoys longships will augment my own fleet and give us sufficient  strength at sea to assault Dragonstone and end Stannis Baratheons pretensions.King Balons longships are occupied for the nonce,"
1648,Tyrion,Tywin,One that does not require the king to give  up half his kingdom.
1649,Baelor,Kevan,"better optionPerhaps we ought move on to the wedding,"
1650,Mace,Tyrion,"Your Grace,in regard to the number of guests ... we have had a raven  from Sunspear."
1651,Mace,Tyrion,They have not asked leave to cross my lands.
1652,Rowan,Tyrion,"Prince Doran comes at my sons invitation,not only to join in our celebration,  but to claim his seat on this council, and the justice Robert denied him for the murder of his sister Elia and  her children.But Lord Tywin, wasnt it you who presented the bodies to Robert, all  wrapped up in Lannister cloaks?"
1653,Kevan,Rowan,"When the king is wed to your Margaery and Myrcella to Prince Trystane, we shall all be one great  House,The enmities of the past should remain there, would you not agree, my lord? This is my daughters wedding   said Lord Tywin firmly. insisted Lord Tyrell, though his tone was more than a little  grudging."
1654,Cersei,Tyrion,"Three hundred Dornishmen need not trouble our plans,We can feed the men-at-arms in  the yard, squeeze some extra benches into the throne room for the lordlings and highborn knights, and  find Prince Doran a place of honor on the dais."
1655,Petyr,Tywin,"Perhaps we can move to a more pleasant task,The fruits of victory await division.What could be sweeter?"
1656,Cersei,Varys,"Its swords Joffrey needs, not toasts,His realm is still plagued with would-be usurpers and  self-styled kings.But not for long, I think,A few more items remain, my lords."
1657,Kevan,Varys,"Ser Addam has found some  crystals from the High Septons crown.It appears certain now that the thieves broke up the crystals and  melted down the gold.Our Father Above knows their guilt and will sit in judgment on them all,No doubt he will,All the same, you must be crowned at the kings wedding.Cersei,  summon your goldsmiths, we must see to a replacement."
1658,Tywin,Varys,You have reports?
1659,Tywin,Varys,A kraken has been seen off the Fingers.
1660,Tywin,Varys,"Not a Greyjoy, mind you, a true kraken."
1661,Tywin,Varys,   said Lord Tywin.
1662,Tywin,Varys,"Tywin,some of the gold  cloaks who deserted during the battle have drifted back to barracks, thinking to take up duty once again. Cersei said at once."
1663,Cersei,Varys,"They have surely earned death, Your Grace, none can deny it."
1664,Mace,Tywin,  
1665,Mace,Tywin,"Why, is there anyone not stirring?"
1666,Brea,Tywin,The deserters serve us best as a lesson.
1667,Brea,Tywin,Nor will any man who sees them begging in the streets.
1668,Jacelyn,Tyrion,Perhaps we might break the knees of a few to make our point.
1669,Jacelyn,Robb,"   his father finished, "
1670,Kevan,Tywin,"And if not, this Mance Rayder might even prove a useful ally."
1671,Kevan,Tywin,Is there more?
1672,Kevan,Tywin,"We are done.My lords, His Grace King Joffrey would no doubt wish to  thank you all for your wisdom and good counsel.I should like private words with my children,You as  well, Kevan."
1673,Kevan,Tyrion,"Master of coin~Whose notion was that, pray?Lord Petyrs,"
1674,Cersei,Petyr,"Do you fear you might be incapable of the task?No,"
1675,Cersei,Eddard,Nor should you.He won Highgarden to our side....
1676,Eddard,Kevan,A coin is as dangerous as a sword in  the wrong hands.
1677,Cersei,Kevan,"Not to us, surely.  "
1678,Cersei,Tywin,"Petyrs gold is made from thin air, with a snap of his fingers.A more useful skill than any of yours, sweet brother,Petyr is a liar -  - and black as well, said the raven of the crow."
1679,Kevan,Tywin,Enough!
1680,Kevan,Yohn,"You are both Lannisters, and will comport yourselves as such."
1681,Kevan,Yohn,I would sooner have Petyr Baelish ruling the Eyrie than any of Lady  Lysas other suitors.
1682,Petyr,Tywin,The lords of the Vale will never accept such as their liege.
1683,Tyrion,Tywin,"And there is this - Lord Petyr continues to demonstrate his loyalty.Only yesterday he brought us word of a Tyrell plot to spirit Sansa Stark off to Highgarden for a visit/ and  there marry her to Lord Maces eldest son, Willas.Petyr brought you word?"
1684,Cersei,Tyrion,Not our master of whisperers?How  interesting.
1685,Cersei,Tyrion,"Sansa is my hostage.She goes nowhere without my leave.Leave you must perforce grant, should Lord Tyrell ask,To refuse him would  be tantamount to declaring that we did not trust him.He would take offense.Let him.What do we care?"
1686,Tyrion,Tywin,"Sweet sister,offend Tyrell and you offend  Redwyne, Tarly, Rowan, and Hightower as well, and perhaps start them wondering whether Robb Stark  might not be more accommodating of their desires.I will not have the rose and the direwolf in bed together,We must forestall  him.How?"
1687,Cersei,Tywin,"By marriage.Yours, to begin with."
1688,Cersei,Tywin,No.
1689,Cersei,Tywin,"I will not.Your Grace,"
1690,Tyrion,Tywin,"And a new marriage would put to rest this talk of  incest for good and all.So long as you remain unwed, you allow Stannis to spread his disgusting slander,You must have a new husband in your bed, to father children on you.Three children is quite sufficient."
1691,Tyrion,Tywin,"The Queen  Regent!You are my daughter, and will do as I command."
1692,Tyrion,Tywin,"I will not sit here and listen to this - You will if you wish to have any voice in the choice of your next husband,I will not marry    again!You will marry and you will breed.Every child you birth makes Stannis more a liar."
1693,Cersei,Tyrion,"Mace Tyrell, Paxter Redwyne, and Doran Martell are wed to younger  women likely to outlive them.Balon Greyjoys wife is elderly and failing, but such a match would commit  us to an alliance with the iron Islands, and I am still uncertain whether that would be our wisest course.No,No, no, no."
1694,Theon,Tywin,"Oberyn Martell might suit, but the Tyrells would take that very ill."
1695,Theon,Tywin,I assume you do not object to wedding a man younger than yourself?I object to wedding any - 
1696,Tyrion,Willas,"Ser Loras has taken the white and Ser Garlan is wed to one of the Fossoways, but there  remains the eldest son, the boy they scheme to wed to Sansa Stark."
1697,Cersei,Tyrion,"That would be the cripple,"
1698,Cersei,Tyrion,"Willas is heir to Highgarden, and by all reports a mild and courtly  young man, fond of reading books and looking at the stars.He has a passion for breeding animals as  well, and owns the finest hounds, hawks, and horses in the Seven Kingdoms."
1699,Cersei,Willas,"The Tyrell heir would be my choice,but if you would prefer another, I will  hear your reasons.That is so very kind of you, Father,It is such a difficult choice you give  me."
1700,Cersei,Tyrion,Do I have your leave to go?
1701,Cersei,Tyrion,"Go,We shall talk again after you have composed yourself.Remember your duty."
1702,Tyrion,Willas,Tyrion.
1703,Tyrion,Willas,"Do I hear the herald summoning me to the lists?Your whoring is a weakness in you,"
1704,Mag,Ygritte,
1705,Joffrey,Tyrion,Does the prospect of marriage amuse you?Only imagining what a bugger-all handsome bridegroom Ill make.
1706,Jon,Satin,"You mean to wed me to Sansa Stark. said Ser Kevan, "
1707,Sansa,Tyrion,"His Grace the  royal pustule has made Sansas life a misery since the day her father died, and now that she is finally rid of  Joffrey you propose to marry her to me."
1708,Sansa,Tyrion,"Even for you, Father.Why, do you plan to mistreat her?"
1709,Shae,Tyrion,"The girls  happiness is not my purpose, nor should it be yours.Our alliances in the south may be as solid as  Casterly Rock, but there remains the north to win, and the key to the north is Sansa Stark.She is no more than a child.Your sister swears shes flowered."
1710,Sansa,Shae,"After that, if you prefer to wait a  year or two before bedding her again, you would be within your rights as her husband."
1711,Sansa,Tywin,"If your  purpose here is to keep her from the  Tyrells, why not return her to her mother?Perhaps that would convince Robb Stark to bend the knee."
1712,Sansa,Tywin,Send her to Riverrun and her mother will match her with a Blackwood    or a Mallister to shore up her sons alliances along the Trident.
1713,Kevan,Tyrion,"She must marry a Lannister, and soon.The man who weds Sansa Stark can claim Winterfell in her name,Had that  not occurred to you?If you will not have the girl, we shall give her to one of your cousins,Kevan, is Lancel  strong enough to wed, do you think?"
1714,Kevan,Tyrion,"If we bring the girl to his bedside, he could say the words ... but to consummate,  no ..."
1715,Sansa,Tyrion,"They have Gennas  boy Tion as well, else he might serve."
1716,Sansa,Tywin,"You asked me to reward you for your efforts in the battle,This  is a chance for you, Tyrion, the best you are ever likely to have."
1717,Tyrion,Tywin,"I once hoped to marry your brother to Lysa Tully, but Aerys named Jaime to his Kingsguard  before the arrangements were complete.When I suggested to Lord Hoster that Lysa might be wed to  you instead, he replied that he wanted a whole man for his daughter."
1718,Lysa,Tywin,"When I offered you to Dome I was told that the suggestion was an insult,In  later years I had similar answers from Yohn Royce and Leyton Hightower."
1719,Robert,Tanda,"if you will not have the Stark girl, I shall find you another wife."
1720,Lollys,Tyrion,. 
1721,Lollys,Tyrion,Id sooner cut it off and feed it to the goats.Then open your eyes.
1722,Tyrion,Tywin,Why would you hesitate? 
1723,Balon,Tywin,"A quirk of mine.Strange to say, I would prefer a wife who wants me in her bed.If you think your whores want you in their bed, you are an even greater fool than I suspected,You disappoint me, Tyrion.I had hoped this match would please you.Yes, we all know how important my pleasure is to you, Father."
1724,Balon,Tywin,"Why Sansa Stark,  and not her?"
1725,Balon,Tywin,"Balon Greyjoy thinks in terms of plunder, not rule."
1726,Eddard,Tyrion,"You are capable of getting a woman with child, I hope?I believe I am,I confess, I cannot prove it."
1727,Robb,Tyrion,"   finished Lord Tywin, It is past time you kept your own garden."
1728,Robb,Tyrion,"You shall never have Casterly  Rock, I promise you.But wed Sansa Stark, and it is just possible that you might win Winterfell."
1729,Robb,Tyrion,"Very good,  Father,"
1730,Robb,Tywin,"And once the Young Wolf sires a litter, any  pups that Sansa births are heirs to nothing."
1731,Robb,Tywin,"Robb Stark will father no children on his fertile Frey, you have my  word."
1732,Kevan,Tyrion,The Young Wolf has taken Gawen Westerlings eldest daughter to wife.
1733,Kevan,Tyrion,He broke his sworn word?
1734,Gawen,Kevan,He threw away the Freys for .
1735,Gawen,Kevan,"A maid of sixteen years, named Jeyne,Lord Gawen once suggested her to me for  Willem or Martyn, but I had to refuse him."
1736,Jeyne,Tyrion,Half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions and the  like.
1737,Jeyne,Tyrion,"Shes long dead, to be sure."
1738,Jeyne,Tyrion,. 
1739,Tyrion,Tywin,"I am surprised,I thought Robb Stark had better sense.He is a boy of sixteen,At that age, sense weighs for little, against lust and love and  honor.He forswore himself, shamed an ally, betrayed a solemn promise.Where is the honor in that?"
1740,Kevan,Tyrion,"He chose the girls honor over his own.Once he had deflowered her, he had no  other course.it would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly,"
1741,Tyrion,Tywin,"Jeyne Westerling is her mothers daughter,and Robb Stark is his fathers son."
1742,Tyrion,Tywin,The  Rains of Castamere
1743,Tyrion,Tywin,"The Crag is not so far from Tarbeck  Hall and Castamere,Youd think the Westerlings might have ridden past and seen the lesson there.Mayhaps they have,They are well aware of Castamere, I promise you.Could the Westerlings and Spicers be such great fools as to believe the wolf can defeat the lion?"
1744,Sansa,Tyrion,"The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who  laugh at them,You will marry Sansa Stark, Tyrion."
1745,Robb,Small,"Smalljon,tell  your father to bring them in."
1746,Eddard,Robb,"Five,Is that all of them?There were eight,We killed two taking them, and a third is dying now."
1747,Edmure,Robb,It required eight of you to kill two unarmed squires.
1748,Edmure,Rickard,"They murdered two of my men as well, to get into the tower.Delp and  Elwood.It was no murder, ser,Any man who steps between a father and his vengeance  asks for death."
1749,Robb,Willem,"I saw your sons die, that night in the Whispering Wood,Tion Frey did not  kill Torrhen."
1750,Eddard,Rickard,"Your sons died honorably on a battlefield, with swords in their hands.They died,The Kingslayer cut them down."
1751,Rickard,Robb,Only blood can pay for blood.The blood of children?
1752,Robb,Willem,How old were they?
1753,Robb,Willem,"Squires.Squires die in every battle.Die fighting, yes."
1754,Catelyn,Robb,Look at them!
1755,Catelyn,Robb,"Tell your mother to look at them,She slew them,  as much as L"
1756,Catelyn,Robb,"My mother had naught to do with this,This was your work."
1757,Greatjon,Robb,"Your  treason.How can it be treason to kill Lannisters, when it is not treason to free them?"
1758,Greatjon,Rickard,Has Your Grace forgotten that we are at war with Casterly Rock?
1759,Greatjon,Rickard,"Didnt  your father teach you that, boy?Boy?"
1760,Rickard,Robb,Leave him!
1761,Greatjon,Robb,"Yes, Lord Umber, leave me to the king."
1762,Greatjon,Robb,"Thats how he deals with treason, our King in the North."
1763,Brynden,Greatjon,"or should I call you the King Who Lost the North, Your Grace?"
1764,Brynden,Greatjon,"Let me spit him,  sire.Let me open his belly so we can see the color of his guts."
1765,Brynden,Robb,"Your  Grace,I will hear Ser Brynden privily, in the audience chamber."
1766,Greatjon,Robb,"Greatjon, keep Lord  Karstark here till I return, and hang the other seven."
1767,Greatjon,Robb,Even the dead ones?Yes.
1768,Greatjon,Robb,Let them feed the crows.
1769,Greatjon,Robb,"Mercy, sire.I killed no one, I only stood at the door to  watch for guards."
1770,Greatjon,Robb,Did you know what Lord Rickard intended?
1771,Greatjon,Robb,"Did you hear the shouts, the screams, the cries for mercy?Aye, I did, but I took no part.   said Robb, "
1772,Greatjon,Robb,"Mother, Uncle, with me, if you please."
1773,Brynden,Robb,The Karstarks are gone.All?
1774,Brynden,Catelyn,"All the fighting men,A few camp followers and serving men were left with their  wounded."
1775,Catelyn,Robb,"The wounded men and servants  were told to keep the campfires lit so no one would know theyd gone, but once the rains began it didnt  matter.Will they re-form, away from Riverrun?"
1776,Catelyn,Robb,No.
1777,Catelyn,Robb,Lord Karstark has sworn to give the hand of his maiden daughter to  any man highbom or low who brings him the head of the Kingslayer.
1778,Catelyn,Robb,"Near three hundred riders and twice as many mounts, melted away in the night."
1779,Catelyn,Robb,"All the mounted strength of  Karhold, lost."
1780,Edmure,Sansa,"No word of this must leave Riverrun,Lord Tywin would ... the Lannisters  pay their debts, they are always saying that.Mother have mercy, when he hears."
1781,Edmure,Robb,"Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer, Uncle?We need speak no falsehood."
1782,Brynden,Robb,. Until we can bring the murdered dead back to life?
1783,Brynden,Robb,"The truth escaped  with the Karstarks, Edmure.It is too late for such games.I owe their fathers truth,And justice.I owe them that as well."
1784,Robb,Roose,Lord Rickard defied me.
1785,Brynden,Robb,"Bolton must be warned.Lord Karstarks heir was at Harrenhal as well,The eldest son, the one the  Lannisters took captive on the Green Fork.Harrion.His name is Harrion."
1786,Brynden,Robb,"A king had best know the names of his enemies,  dont you think?"
1787,Brynden,Robb,"You know that for a certainty?That this will make young  Karstark your enemy?What else would he be?I am about to kill his father, hes not like to thank me.He might.There are sons who hate their fathers, and in a stroke you will make him Lord of Karhold."
1788,Brynden,Robb,"Even if Harrion were that sort, he could never openly forgive his fathers killer."
1789,Edmure,Robb,"The north remembers.Pardon him, then,"
1790,Edmure,Robb,"Spare his life, I mean."
1791,Catelyn,Jaime,"Keep him in chains, say.A hostage?"
1792,Catelyn,Jaime,"Yes, a hostage!"
1793,Catelyn,Walder,"Tell the son that so long as he  remains loyal, his father will not be harmed."
1794,Catelyn,Walder,"If we should lose the Karstarks  as well, what hope is there?What hope...Weve had naught  from Ser Rodrik in the north, no response from Walder Frey to our new offer, only silence from the  Eyrie."
1795,Catelyn,Walder,Will your sister never answer us?
1796,Catelyn,Walder,I will not believe that none of the birds have reached her.
1797,Catelyn,Robb,The birds have reached her.
1798,Catelyn,Robb,Lysa was never brave.
1799,Brynden,Robb,"She ran from Kings Landing for fear, to the safest place she knows, and  she sits on her mountain hoping everyone will forget her.The knights of the Vale could make all the difference in this war,"
1800,Brynden,Lysa,"If I could land at  White Harbor I could flank Moat Cailin and drive the ironmen from the north in half a year.It will not happen, sire,Cat is right."
1801,Robb,Theon,"The Bloody Gate will remain closed.The Others can take her, then,Bloody Rickard Karstark as well."
1802,Brynden,Willem,Yet now I have to kill my dead friends father  for their sakes.
1803,Brynden,Willem,"Will the Lannisters thank me for Lord Rickards head?Will the  Freys?No,All the more reason to spare Lord Rickards life and keep him hostage,"
1804,Edmure,Robb,Lord Rickard dies.But why~ You said yourself -  It does not change what I must do.
1805,Edmure,Rickard,"In battle I might have slain Tion and Willem myself, but this was no battle."
1806,Edmure,Rickard,I shall deal with him at dawn.
1807,Rickard,Robb,"This is my work,He dies at my word.He must die by my hand."
1808,Rickard,Robb,"For that much, I thank you.But for naught else."
1809,Aerys,Rickard,"The  blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours, boy."
1810,Eddard,Robb,"We are kin, Stark and Karstark.This kinship did not stop you from betraying me,And it will not save you now.Kneel, my  lord."
1811,Catelyn,Robb,"Old gods or new, it makes no matter,no man is so accursed as the  kinslayer.Kneel, traitor,Or must I have them force your head onto the block?"
1812,Catelyn,Robb,"The gods shall judge you, as you have judged me."
1813,Catelyn,Robb,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold."
1814,Catelyn,Robb,"Here in sight of gods  and men, I judge you guilty of murder and high treason."
1815,Catelyn,Robb,"Would you speak a final word?Kill me, and be cursed.You are no king of mine."
1816,Brynden,Catelyn,"I only pray  I do not need to hang them,"
1817,Hoster,Vyman,"It will not be much longer,His last  strength is going, though still he tries to fight.He was ever a fighter,A sweet stubborn man.Yes,"
1818,Jeyne,Vyman,Time    to yield.
1819,Catelyn,Jeyne,"Lady  Catelyn, I do not mean to disturb you...You are most welcome here, Your Grace."
1820,Catelyn,Jeyne,Please.
1821,Catelyn,Jeyne,"I dont feel like a Grace.You are one, nonetheless.Please, come sit, Your Grace.Jeyne."
1822,Jeyne,Tywin,"As you wish.How might I serve you, Jeyne?Its Robb,Hes so miserable, so ... so angry and disconsolate.I dont know what to do.It is a hard thing to take a mans life.I know."
1823,Jeyne,Rollam,"its easier that way, dont you think?Yes,but my lord husband taught his sons that killing should never be easy.Oh."
1824,Jeyne,Rollam,Robb has not eaten all day.
1825,Catelyn,Hoster,"Please, my lady, youre his mother, tell me what I should do."
1826,Brandon,Robb,"Sometimes,"
1827,Catelyn,Eddard,"Jeyne, child, you have wed the north, as I did ... and in the north, the winters will come."
1828,Catelyn,Eddard,Be patient.
1829,Catelyn,Eddard,That is all I can tell you.
1830,Catelyn,Eddard,"I will,Ill be there."
1831,Catelyn,Robb,I should go back.
1832,Catelyn,Robb,"But if hes still at his maps, Ill be patient.Do,Jeyne,theres one more thing Robb needs from you, though he may not know it yet himself."
1833,Eddard,Robb,My mother says the same.
1834,Bran,Brandon,Sometimes  twice or more.
1835,Brandon,Catelyn,"Ill be with child soon, I promise.I pray to our Mother  Above, every night.Very good."
1836,Brandon,Catelyn,To the old gods and the new.
1837,Catelyn,Jeyne,"An Eddard and a Brandon,And perhaps in time a Hoster.Would you like  that?"
1838,Brienne,Jaime,Six maids there were in a spring-fed pool.
1839,Brienne,Jaime,. What are you doing?
1840,Brienne,Jaime,Singing.
1841,Brienne,Cleos,"Though somewhat prettier, Ill warrant.Be quiet,Please, Jaime,Lord Mooton is sworn to Riverrun, we dont want to draw him  out of his castle.  "
1842,Cersei,Cleos,"I have a yen to see if the wench can use that sword she  wears.If you wont be quiet, you leave me no choice but to gag you, Kingslayer.Unchain my hands and Ill play mute all the way to Kings Landing.What could be fairer than that,  wench?Brienne!My name is Brienne!"
1843,Cersei,Jaime,"Care for a bath, Brienne?"
1844,Cersei,Jaime,Youre a maiden and theres the pool.Ill wash your back.
1845,Aerys,Cleos,"Shes taking the Duskendale road,it would be safer to follow the coast.Safer but slower."
1846,Aerys,Cleos,"If truth be told, Im bored with your company."
1847,Cleos,Jaime,Down!
1848,Brienne,Jaime,"Behind the wall,"
1849,Brienne,Jaime,At them!
1850,Brienne,Jaime,Evenfall!
1851,Brienne,Jaime,Tarth!Tarth!
1852,Brienne,Jaime,Lost your taste for battle?They were running.Thats the best time to kill them.
1853,Brienne,Jaime,"Why did you charge?Bowmen are fearless so long as they can hide behind walls and shoot at you from afar, but if you come  at them, they run."
1854,Cleos,Jaime,You ought to let me tend them.YOU?Who else?
1855,Cleos,Jaime,He is a Lannister of sorts.
1856,Brienne,Jaime,Hes still warm.Hell cool soon enough.
1857,Brienne,Jaime,Im weary of rags and fleas.He was your cousin.
1858,Brienne,Jaime,"Was,Have no fear, I am amply provisioned in cousins."
1859,Brienne,Jaime,You  need someone to share the watches.You can stand a watch without weapons.
1860,Brienne,Jaime,Chained to a tree?
1861,Brienne,Jaime,"Or perhaps I could make my own bargain with the next lot of  outlaws and let them slit that thick neck of yours, wench.I will not arm you. - Brienne, I know."
1862,Cleos,Jaime,Step away from him.
1863,Cleos,Jaime,Stop that.
1864,Brienne,Jaime,"Very good, wench.Give me the sword, Kingslayer.Oh, I will."
1865,Brienne,Jaime,"Not half bad,For a wench."
1866,Chett,Jaime,"I would not hurt you, Kingslayer.As if you could."
1867,Grunt,Jaime,"Not bad at all,For a wench?For a squire, say.A green one."
1868,Grunt,Jaime,"Come on, come on, my  sweetling, the musics still playing.Might I have this dance, my lady?"
1869,Bronn,Kevan,Yield!
1870,Brienne,Jaime,YIELD!
1871,Brienne,Jaime,Yield!
1872,Brienne,Jaime,Yield!
1873,Brienne,Jaime,"Yield, or Ill drown  you!And break your oath?"
1874,Brienne,Jaime,Like me?
1875,Jaime,Small,"Well met, friends,My pardons if I disturbed you.You caught me chastising my wife.Seemed to me she was doing the chastising."
1876,Brienne,Jaime,"I have a hundred stags - Well take that for a start, mlady.Then well have your cunt,It cant be as ugly as the rest of you.Turn her over and rape her arse, Rorge,That way you wont need to look at her.And rob her o the pleasure o looking at me?"
1877,Brienne,Jaime,Who commands here?
1878,Gregor,Jaime,"I have that honor, Ser Jaime."
1879,Gregor,Jaime,Urswyck I am.Called Urswyck the  Faithful.You know who I am?
1880,Gregor,Jaime,it takes more than a beard and a shaved head to deceive the Brave  Companions.
1881,Amory,Gregor,"If you know me, Urswyck, you know youll have your reward."
1882,Amory,Jaime,"As for the wench, shes highborn, and worth a good ransom."
1883,Amory,Jaime,Is it so?How fortunate.
1884,Harren,Jaime,You heard me.Wheres the goat?A few hours distant.
1885,Harren,Jaime,Lord Vargo grows prickly about his dignity.
1886,Harren,Jaime,"Ill be sure and remember that, when I see him.Lord of what, pray?Harrenhal.It has been promised."
1887,Harren,Jaime,Ill have these chains off.
1888,Harren,Jaime,Did I say  something amusing?
1889,Harren,Jaime,"Youre the funniest thing I seen since Biter chewed that septas teats off.You and your father lost too many battles,We had to trade our lion pelts for  wolfskins."
1890,Jaime,Rorge,"What Timeon means to say is that the Brave Companions are no longer in  the hire of House Lannister.We now serve Lord Bolton, and the King in the North."
1891,Jaime,Rorge,And men say I have shit for honor?
1892,Falyse,Tyrion,
1893,Brienne,Rorge,. 
1894,Brienne,Jaime,"I hope youre pleased, wench,"
1895,Brienne,Jaime,"If youd armed me, wed never have been taken."
1896,Brienne,Cersei,"When we make camp for the night,  youll be raped, and more than once,Youd be wise not to resist.If you fight them,  youll lose more than a few teeth."
1897,Brienne,Cersei,"Is that what you would do, if you were a woman?"
1898,Brienne,Cersei,"If I were a woman, Id make them kill me.But Im not.Jaime kicked  their horse to a trot. "
1899,Brienne,Cersei,A word!
1900,Cersei,Jaime,"What  would you have of me, ser?And mind your tongue, or Ill chastise you again.Gold,You do like gold?"
1901,Cersei,Jaime,"It has its uses, I do confess."
1902,Cersei,Jaime,All the gold in Casterly Rock.
1903,Cersei,Jaime,"Tarth is  called the Sapphire Isle, a maiden told me once."
1904,Harren,Jaime,Do you take me for a tumcloak?Certainly.What else?
1905,Harren,Jaime,"Kings Landing is a long way, and your father  is there.Lord Tywin may resent us for selling Harrenhal to Lord Bolton."
1906,Harren,Jaime,Leave me to deal with my father.
1907,Harren,Jaime,"Ill get you a knighthood.Ser Urswyck,How proud my dear wife would be to hear it.If only  I hadnt killed her."
1908,Harren,Jaime,And what of brave Lord Vargo?Shall I sing you a verse of The Rains of Castamere?The goat wont be quite so brave when my father  gets hold of him.And how will he do that?Are your fathers arms so long that they can reach over the walls of Harrenhal  and pluck us out?If need be.
1909,Harren,Jaime,Are you such a fool  as to think the goat can outfight the lion?
1910,Aerys,Jaime,"I have heard enough, Kingslayer.I  would have to be a great fool indeed to believe the promises of an oathbreaker like you."
1911,Aerys,Brienne,Why did you tell him Tarth was the Sapphire Isle?
1912,Aerys,Brienne,"Hes like to think my fathers rich in gemstones...You best pray he does.Is every word you say a lie, Kingslayer?Tarth is called the Sapphire Isle for the blue of its waters.Shout it a little louder, wench, I dont think Urswyck heard you."
1913,Brienne,Vargo,"just  close your eyes, open your legs, and pretend theyre all Lord Renly."
1914,Rorge,Timeon,"Kingthlayer,You are my captifth.My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth,Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver  Ser Jaime to his brother at Kings Landing."
1915,Rorge,Timeon,"Thilence her.Hear me,in the name of the King in  the North, the king you serve, please, listen - See that you dont break any bones,The horse-faced bitch is worth her weight in sapphires."
1916,Brienne,Vargo,"Thith ith a thweet day,"
1917,Jaime,Vargo,"Lord Vargo, you were foolish to leave my fathers service, but  it is not too late to make amends.He will pay well for me, you know it.Oh yeth,Half the gold in Cathterly Rock, I thall have.But firth I mutht thend him a  methage."
1918,Arya,Jon,
1919,Beric,Lem,Six!
1920,Tyrion,Tywin,
1921,Beric,Lem,"He was hanged.Aye, hanged he was, but Thoros cut him down before he died."
1922,Greenbeard,Lem,"His lordships a hard  man to kill, he is.And a hard man to find, it would seem,Have you asked the Lady of the Leaves?We shall,"
1923,Gendry,Lem,"Most like it is,Dont see  no other bridges.Youd know for certain if there was a song,One good song, and wed know  who Ser Maynard used to be and why he wanted to cross this bridge so bad.Poor old Lychester might  be as far famed as the Dragonknight if hed only had sense enough to keep a singer.Lord Lychesters sons died in Roberts Rebellion,Some on one side, some on Vother."
1924,Anguy,Arya,"No bloody songs like to help any o that.What did the maester mean, about asking the Lady of the Leaves?"
1925,Anguy,Arya,Wait and see.
1926,Anguy,Arya,"Hobble the horses and up we go,"
1927,Gregor,Lem,"We cannot stay here much longer, with autumn on us,A dozen wolves went down the Hayford road nine days past, hunting.If theyd chanced to  look up they might have seen us.Youve not seen Lord Beric?"
1928,Gregor,Lem,Hes dead.
1929,Gregor,Lem,"Gregor caught him, and drove a dagger through his eye."
1930,Gregor,Lem,"He had it from the lips of a man who saw it happen.Thats an old stale tale, and false,The lightning lords not so easy to kill."
1931,Gregor,Lem,"lack could tell you.Well, I never did,My father got himself good and hanged by Lord    Pipers bailiff, my brother Wat got sent to the Wall, and the Lannisters killed my other brothers.An eye,  thats nothing.You swear hes not dead?"
1932,Gregor,Lem,"Bless you, Lem, thats the best tidings  weve had in half a year.May the Warrior defend him, and the red priest too."
1933,Arya,Lem,"They hacked the Maidens breasts off too, though those were only  wood,And the eyes, the eyes were jet and lapis and mother-of-pearl, they pried them out  with their knives.May the Mother have mercy on them all.Whose work was this?"
1934,Arya,Lem,"Mummers?No,Northmen, they were."
1935,Arya,Gendry,"They wanted the  Kingslayer, they said."
1936,Arya,Greenbeard,"The lightning lord is everywhere and nowhere, skinny squirrel.Im not a squirrel,Ill almost be a woman soon.Ill be one-and-ten.Best watch out I dont marry you, then!"
1937,Anguy,Arya,"You need a lighter bow, milady,If theres  seasoned wood at Riverrun, might be Ill make you one."
1938,Arya,Hoster,"Youre a young fool, Archer."
1939,Hoster,Lem,"And that son of his ... a  man who hates music cant be trusted, I always say.Its not music he hates,Its you, fool.Well, he has no cause.The wench was willing to make a man of him, is it my fault he drank too much to  do the deed?"
1940,Anguy,Lem,"Was it you who made a song of it, or some other bloody arse in  love with his own voice?I only sang it the once,And whos to say the song was about him?Twas a song  about a fish.A floppy fish,"
1941,Arya,Harwin,"What did he mean about  ransom?We have sore need of horses, milady."
1942,Arya,Harwin,"Winter is coming, remember?"
1943,Arya,Robb,"You will  not be the first highbom captive weve ransomed.Nor the last, Id hope."
1944,Arya,Gendry,"No harm can ever come to those as sleep here,"
1945,Arya,Nan,"The old gods stir and will not let me sleep,I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye."
1946,Arya,Sansa,"Do you have gifts for me, to pay me for my dreams?Dreams,"
1947,Arya,Sansa,"Are you going to pay me for  that, old woman?The wench is dead,Only worms may kiss her now.Ill have my song or Ill have you gone."
1948,Arya,Harwin,"Saw her, did you?Was she a ghost?Do ghosts complain of how their joints creak?"
1949,Arya,Harwin,"But she knows things she has no business knowing, and sometimes shell tell you if  she likes the look of you.Did she like the looks of you?"
1950,Arya,Harwin,"The sound of me, at least."
1951,Arya,Harwin,"Not a bad song, mind you, but I know others just as good."
1952,Arya,Harwin,"What matters  is, we have the scent now.Youll soon be seeing Thoros and the lightning lord, Ill wager.If youre their men, why do they hide from you?"
1953,Arya,Harwin,"I wouldnt call it hiding,  milady, but its true, Lord Beric moves about a lot, and seldom lets on what his plans are."
1954,Arya,Gendry,"And when one of us is caught and put to the question, well, we  cant tell them where to find Lord Beric no matter what they do to us."
1955,Arya,Gendry,"You know what it  means, to be put to the question?"
1956,Arya,Gendry,"Tickling, they called it.Polliver and Raff and all."
1957,Beric,Tickler,Is  there gold hidden in the village?
1958,Beric,Tickler,"Silver, gems?"
1959,Harwin,Tickler,"Where did they go, did you say?"
1960,Harwin,Tickler,"He always asked the same questions,but he changed the tickling every day.No child should be made to suffer that,Gregor lost half his men at the Stone Mill, we hear."
1961,Harwin,Tickler,"Ive  heard his lordship say this war began when the Hand sent him out to bring the kings justice to Gregor  Clegane, and thats how he means for it to end."
1962,Harwin,Tickler,"You best mount  up, milady.Its a long days ride to Acorn Hall, but at the end of it well have a roof above our heads and  a hot supper in our bellies."
1963,Arya,Lem,Who dressed the poor child in those Bolton rags?
1964,Arya,Lem,That badge ...  theres many a man who would hang her in half a heartbeat for wearing a flayed man on her breast.
1965,Arya,Small,"My great-aunt is a septa at a motherhouse in Oldtown,I sent my daughter there when the war  began."
1966,Arya,Small,What do you like to do?
1967,Arya,Small,"Needlework.Very restful, isnt it?Well,not the way I do it.No?"
1968,Arya,Small,"Do you work at it every day?I did till I lost Needle.My new ones not as good.,In times like these, we all must make do as best we can."
1969,Arya,Small,Now you look a proper young lady.
1970,Arya,Small,"I do not know who you are, child,and it may be thats for the best."
1971,Arya,Small,"In times like these, it is better to be insignificant."
1972,Arya,Gendry,"I have walls, but too few  men to hold them."
1973,Greenbeard,Thoros,Word?
1974,Greenbeard,Thoros,They were here not a fortnight past.
1975,Anguy,Thoros,Youve eaten one tonight.Thoros herding sheep?
1976,Anguy,Lem,"I grant you it was an odd sight, but Thoros claimed that as a priest he knew how to tend a flock.Aye, and shear them too,Someone could make a rare fine song of that."
1977,Lem,Small,"Someone who doesnt rhyme carry on with Dondarrion,  perhaps.Or play Oh, Lay My Sweet Lass Down in the Grass to every milkmaid in the shire and leave  two of them with big bellies.It was Let Me Drink Your Beauty,"
1978,Lem,Small,I play to please.
1979,Harwin,Small,"The riverlands are full of maids youve pleased, all drinking tansy tea."
1980,Harwin,Small,"Men will be calling you Tom Sevensons  before much longer.As it happens,I passed seven many years ago."
1981,Harwin,Small,"Did his lordship say where he was bound, milady?"
1982,Harwin,Small,"Lord Beric never shares his plans, but theres hunger down near Stoney Sept and the Threepenny  Wood.I should look for him there."
1983,Harwin,Small,"Youd best know, Ive had less pleasant  callers as well.A pack of wolves came howling around my gates, thinking I might have Jaime Lannister in  here."
1984,Harwin,Small,"Then its true, the Kingslayer is loose again?"
1985,Harwin,Small,I hardly think theyd be hunting him if he was chained up  under Riverrun.What did mlady tell them?
1986,Arya,Small,"Why, that I had Ser Jaime naked in my bed, but Id left him much too exhausted to come down."
1987,Arya,Small,I believe they made for  Blackbottom Bend.
1988,Arya,Small,"What northmen was it, who came looking after the Kingslayer?"
1989,Arya,Small,"They did not give their names, child, but they  wore black, with the badge of a white sun on the breast."
1990,Lem,Small,Did they say how Lannister came to escape?
1991,Lem,Small,"They did,Not that I believe a word of it.They claimed that Lady Catelyn set  him free."
1992,Arya,Small,"Go on with you,Thats madness."
1993,Arya,Small,"I thought the same,"
1994,Arya,Harwin,"Such talk is not for your ears, milady.No, I want to hear."
1995,Arya,Greenbeard,"Go on with you, skinny squirrel,Be a good little lady  and go play in the yard while we talk, now."
1996,Gendry,Thoros,Arya?
1997,Gendry,Thoros,Lady Smallwood said theres a smithy.Want to have a look?If you want.
1998,Gendry,Thoros,"This Thoros,is he the same Thoros who lived in the  castle at Kings Landing?"
1999,Small,Thoros,"He wont remember me, but he used to come to our forge."
2000,Gendry,Thoros,My master always scolded him about his flaming swords.
2001,Gendry,Thoros,"It was only an alchemists trick, my master said, but it scared the  horses and some of the greener knights."
2002,Gendry,Thoros,"He isnt very  priestly, is he?No,Master Mott said Thoros could outdrink even King Robert.They were pease  in a pod, he told me, both gluttons and sots.You shouldnt call the king a sot."
2003,Gendry,Robert,I was talking about Thoros.
2004,Arya,Thoros,"He liked feasts and tourneys, that was why King Robert was so fond of him."
2005,Arya,Thoros,"He  fought with one of his flaming swords, setting ironmen afire with every slash.I wish I had a flaming sword."
2006,Arya,Thoros,"Its only a trick, I told you."
2007,Gendry,Thoros,Every time they would have a fight about the price.
2008,Gendry,Thoros,Master Mott said it was time I made my first longsword.
2009,Arya,Gendry,"Only Yoren came, and took me away  for the Nights Watch.You can still make swords if you want,You can make them for my brother Robb when we  get to Riverrun.Riverrun."
2010,Arya,Gendry,"You look different now.Like a proper  little girl.I look like an oak tree, with all these stupid acorns.Nice, though.A nice oak tree."
2011,Arya,Gendry,You even smell nice for a  change.You dont.You stink.
2012,Arya,Gendry,"I bet I dont look so nice now,"
2013,Gendry,Lem,Are we certain this one is a highbom lady?
2014,Gendry,Lem,"You want to fight, fight with me!"
2015,Arya,Harwin,"You keep your  hands off o her, you hear me?I started it Gendry was just talking.Leave the boy, Lem,Arya did start it, I have no doubt.She was much the same at  Winterfell."
2016,Arya,Small,"I have no gowns of leaves,but Carellen left some other  dresses that might serve."
2017,Arya,Small,"They were my sons things,He died when  he was seven.Im sorry, my lady."
2018,Arya,Small,"Im sorry I tore the acorn dress too.it was pretty.Yes, child."
2019,Arya,Small,Be brave.
2020,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell the Westerosi whore to lower her eyes,I deal in meat, not metal."
2021,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Even the dim purple eyes of a sunset savage can see how magnificent my creatures are, surely."
2022,Daenerys,Kraznys,"The Good Master Kraznys asks, are they not magnificent?"
2023,Daenerys,Jorah,"They might be adequate to my needs,"
2024,Jorah,Kraznys,"Tell me of their training.The Westerosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise, to keep the price down,She wishes to know how they were trained."
2025,Daenerys,Kraznys,Are all Westerosi pigs so ignorant?
2026,Daenerys,Kraznys,All the world knows that the Unsullied are masters  of spear and shield and shortsword.
2027,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell her what she would know, slave,  and be quick about it.The day is hot."
2028,Chett,Kraznys,"They are chosen young, for size and speed and strength,They begin their training at five."
2029,Arstan,Kraznys,"Among the Unsullied it is said that on the day they  win their spiked cap, the worst is done with, for no duty that will ever fall to them could be as hard as  their training."
2030,Arstan,Kraznys,"Tell her that these have  been standing here for a day and a night, with no food nor water."
2031,Arstan,Daenerys,"Tell her that.I call that madness, not courage,"
2032,Arstan,Jorah,What did the smelly old man say?
2033,Craster,Qhorin,
2034,Arstan,Daenerys,"But nowhere  between the seas will you ever find any more obedient.Sheep are obedient,"
2035,Daenerys,Kraznys,"A word from me  and these sheep would spill his stinking old bowels on the bricks,"
2036,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Do they eat dogs or horse in these Seven Kingdoms?They prefer pigs and cows, your worship.Beef."
2037,Daenerys,Kraznys,Food for unwashed savages.
2038,Daenerys,Kraznys,Why do you cut them?
2039,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Whole men are stronger than eunuchs, I have always heard.A eunuch who is cut young will never have the brute strength of one of your Westerosi knights, this is  true,A bull is strong as well, but bulls die  every day in the fighting pits."
2040,Arstan,Daenerys,"They are the lockstep legions of Old Ghis come again, absolutely obedient, absolutely loyal,  and utterly without fear."
2041,Arstan,Daenerys,"Even the bravest men fear death and maiming,"
2042,Arstan,Kraznys,"Tell the old man that he smells of piss, and needs a stick to  hold him up.Truly, your worship?"
2043,Arstan,Kraznys,"No, not truly, are you a girl or a goat, to ask such folly?"
2044,Arstan,Kraznys,"Say that death means nothing to them, and maiming less than nothing."
2045,Daenerys,Kraznys,Would you like  another?
2046,Daenerys,Kraznys,If it please your worship.
2047,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell the Good Master that I see how strong his Unsullied are, and how bravely they suffer  pain."
2048,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell this  ignorant whore of a westerner that courage has nothing to do with it.The Good Master says that was not courage, Your Grace.Tell her to open those sluts eyes of hers.He begs you attend this carefully, Your Grace."
2049,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Your sword,"
2050,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Stand,Your worship."
2051,Daenerys,Kraznys,What is he doing?
2052,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell the cow to stop her bleating,This will do him no  great harm.Men have no need of nipples, eunuchs even less so."
2053,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Here, Im done with you.This one is pleased to have served you."
2054,Daenerys,Kraznys,"They feel no pain, you see.How can that be?"
2055,Daenerys,Kraznys,"The wine of courage,It is no true wine at all, but made from deadly  nightshade, bloodfly larva, black lotus root, and many secret things."
2056,Arstan,Daenerys,"In Yunkai and Meereen, eunuchs are often made by removing a boys testicles, but leaving the penis."
2057,Arstan,Daenerys,The Unsullied are the purest creatures on the earth.
2058,Arstan,Daenerys,"I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn  vows to keep chaste and father no children, but live only for their duty.Is it not so?It is,There are many such orders."
2059,Arstan,Daenerys,". Poor things,Men were  not made to live thus."
2060,Arstan,Daenerys,"No woman can ever tempt them, nor any man."
2061,Arstan,Daenerys,"There are other ways to tempt men, besides  the flesh,Men, yes, but not Unsullied."
2062,Daenerys,Kraznys,We do not even permit them names.No names?
2063,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Can that be what the Good Master said?They have no  names?It is so, Your Grace."
2064,Daenerys,Kraznys,There is his name.Ask the whore of Westeros  whether she can read Ghiscari glyphs.
2065,Blue,Daenerys,What is your name?
2066,Blue,Daenerys,"This ones name is Red Flea, your worship."
2067,Blue,Kraznys,"And yesterday, what was it?Black Rat, your worship.The day before?Brown Flea, your worship.Before that?This one does not recall, your worship."
2068,Blue,Kraznys,"Or Blue Worm.Tell her all their names are such,It reminds them that by themselves they  are vermin.The name disks are thrown in an empty cask at dutys end, and each dawn plucked up again  at random.More madness,How can any man possibly remember a new name every  day?Those who cannot are culled in training, along with those who cannot run all day in full pack, scale a  mountain in the black of night, walk across a bed of coals, or slay an infant."
2069,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Whose infants do they slay?To win his spiked cap, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find some wailing  newborn, and kill it before its mothers  eyes.In this way, we make certain that there is no weakness left in them."
2070,Daenerys,Kraznys,"You take a babe from its mothers arms, kill it as  she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
2071,Arstan,Kraznys,What a soft mewling fool  this one is.
2072,Arstan,Kraznys,The  Unsullied are not permitted to steal.
2073,Arstan,Kraznys,Tell her that few ever fail that  test.
2074,Arstan,Daenerys,"It makes for a good strong lesson, we find."
2075,Daenerys,Kraznys,"The Good Master has said that these eunuchs cannot be tempted with coin or flesh,"
2076,Daenerys,Kraznys,". They would kill him out of hand and bring her his head, tell her that,Other slaves  may steal and hoard up silver in hopes of buying freedom, but an Unsullied would not take it if the little  mare offered it as a gift."
2077,Daenerys,Kraznys,"They are soldiers, and that is all.It is soldiers I need,Tell her it is well she came to Astapor, then.Ask her how large an army she wishes to buy.How many Unsullied do you have to sell?Eight thousand fully trained and available at present."
2078,Daenerys,Kraznys,"They mingle with other slaves, even freemen, and forget who and what they are."
2079,Daenerys,Kraznys,"This beggar queen must  understand, such wonders do not come cheaply."
2080,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell her they are like Valyrian steel, folded over and over and  hammered for years on end, until they are stronger and more resilient than any metal on earth.I know of Valyrian steel,Ask the Good Master if the Unsullied have their own officers.You must set your own officers over them."
2081,Daenerys,Kraznys,"If it is wits she wants,  let her buy scribes.And their gear?Sword, shield, spear, sandals, and quilted tunic are included,And the spiked caps, to  be sure.They will wear such armor as you wish, but you must provide it."
2082,Arstan,Daenerys,"You have lived long in the world,  Whitebeard.Now that you have seen them, what do you say?I say no, Your Grace,Why?"
2083,Arstan,Daenerys,Speak freely.
2084,Daenerys,Kraznys,"My queen,"
2085,Aerys,Daenerys,"You will do great  harm to your cause, and to the honor of your House.Yet I must have some army,The boy Joffrey will not give me the Iron Throne for asking  politely.When the day comes that you raise your banners, half of Westeros will be with you,Your brother Rhaegar is still remembered, with great love.And my father?"
2086,Craster,Qhorin,
2087,Aerys,Daenerys,"Magister Illyrio can keep you safe while your dragons  grow, and send secret envoys across the narrow sea on your behalf, to sound out the high lords for your  cause.Those same high lords who abandoned my father to the Kingslayer and bent the knee to Robert the  Usurper?Even those who bent their knees may yearn in their hearts for the return of the dragons.May,"
2088,Daenerys,Kraznys,I must consider carefully.
2089,Daenerys,Kraznys,Tell her to consider quickly.
2090,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Only three days past I  showed these same Unsullied to a corsair king who hopes to buy them all.The corsair wanted only a hundred, your worship,"
2091,Daenerys,Kraznys,Corsairs are all liars.
2092,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell her that, girl."
2093,Daenerys,Kraznys,Remind your Good Master of  who I am.
2094,Daenerys,Kraznys,"My blood is the blood of Aegon the Conqueror, and of old Valyria  before him."
2095,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Old Ghis ruled an empire when the Valyrians were still fucking sheep,"
2096,Daenerys,Kraznys,My tongue is wasted wagging at women.
2097,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell the whore that if she requires a guide to our  sweet city, Kraznys mo Nakloz will gladly serve her ... and service her as well, if she is more woman than  she looks.Good Master Kraznys would be most pleased to show you Astapor while you ponder, Your Grace,I will feed her jellied dog brains, and a fine rich stew of red octopus and unborn puppy."
2098,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Many delicious dishes can be had here, he says.Tell her how pretty the pyramids are at night,Tell her I will lick honey off her  breasts, or allow her to lick honey off mine if she prefers.Astapor is most beautiful at dusk, Your Grace,The Good Masters light silk lanterns  on every terrace, so all the pyramids glow with colored lights.Pleasure barges ply the Worm, playing soft  music and calling at the little islands for food and wine and other delights.Ask her if she wishes to view our fighting pits,Douquors Pit has a fine folly  scheduled for the evening."
2099,Arstan,Daenerys,"One boy will be rolled in honey, one in blood,  and one in rotting fish, and she may wager on which the bear will eat first."
2100,Arstan,Kraznys,"I have my own bear on Balerion,and he may well eat  me if I do not return to him.See,It is not the woman who decides, it is this man  she runs to.As ever!Thank the Good Master for his patient kindness,and tell him that I will think on all I  learned here."
2101,Jhogo,Small,Make way!
2102,Daenerys,Jhogo,Make way for the Mother of Dragons!
2103,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Not in this place, blood of my blood,These bricks have heard too much of the sound of whips."
2104,Arstan,Daenerys,"Bricks and blood built Astapor,and bricks and blood her people.What is that?"
2105,Arstan,Daenerys,"An old rhyme a maester taught me, when I was a boy."
2106,Arstan,Daenerys,"The bricks of  Astapor are red with the blood of the slaves who make them.I can well believe that,Then leave this place before your heart turns to brick as well.Sail this very night, on the evening tide."
2107,Arstan,Daenerys,"When I leave Astapor it must be with an army, Ser Jorah says.Ser Jorah was a slaver himself, Your Grace,There are sellswords in  Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh you can hire."
2108,Arstan,Daenerys,"Find your army there, I beg you.My brother visited Pentos, Myr, Braavos, near all the Free Cities."
2109,Arstan,Daenerys,"I will not come to Pentos bowl in hand.Better to come a beggar than a slaver,There speaks one who has been neither."
2110,Daenerys,Drogo,"Do you know what it is like to be sold,  squire?"
2111,Arstan,Daenerys,Do you think I have forgotten how it felt  to be afraid?
2112,Arstan,Daenerys,"Your Grace, I did not mean to give offense.Only lies offend me, never honest counsel."
2113,Arstan,Daenerys,"I have  a dragons temper, thats all.You must not let it frighten you.I shall try and remember."
2114,Belwas,Daenerys,"Dog,Good dog in Astapor, little  queen.Eat?"
2115,Belwas,Daenerys,"That is kind of you, Belwas, but no."
2116,Daenerys,Jorah,"Your Grace,The slavers have  come and gone."
2117,Daenerys,Jorah,They crawled  over every foot of our holds and made note of all we had.
2118,Daenerys,Jorah,How many men do they  have for sale?None.
2119,Daenerys,Jorah,"They sell eunuchs, not men."
2120,Daenerys,Jorah,"So dont call them men, ser.Khaleesi,the Unsullied are chosen as boys, and trained - I have heard all I care to of their training."
2121,Daenerys,Jorah,If I have displeased my queen - 
2122,Daenerys,Jorah,"If you were my true knight, you would never have  brought me to this vile sty.As Your Grace commands."
2123,Drogo,Groleo,"I want to sail now, not on the tide, I want to sail far and fast and never look back."
2124,Drogo,Groleo,"There are eight thousand brick eunuchs for sale, and  I must find some way to buy them."
2125,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,Youre  too big for that now, sweetling."
2126,Drogo,Irri,"They have been wild while you were gone, Khaleesi,Viserion clawed splinters from the  door, do you see?"
2127,Daenerys,Drogo,"When I grabbed  his tail to hold him back, he turned and bit me."
2128,Daenerys,Drogo,Did any of them try to burn their way free?
2129,Daenerys,Drogo,"No, Khaleesi."
2130,Drogo,Irri,The slaver men feared to come near him.
2131,Drogo,Irri,"Im sorry he hurt you.Dragons are not meant to be  locked up in a small ships cabin.Dragons are like horses in this,And riders, too."
2132,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"They do not like the black salt sea.I know,I do, I know.My khaleesi is sad?Yes,"
2133,Daenerys,Irri,Should I pleasure the khaleesi?
2134,Daenerys,Irri,No.
2135,Daenerys,Irri,   the girl said. she insisted.
2136,Daenerys,Irri,Leave me now.
2137,Daenerys,Irri,To think.
2138,Daenerys,Kraznys,Khaleesi.
2139,Daenerys,Kraznys,Might I speak frankly? 
2140,Chett,Daenerys,"Say what you will, ser.When Aegon the Dragon stepped ashore in Westeros, the kings of Vale and Rock and Reach did not  rush to hand him their crowns."
2141,Chett,Daenerys,And that will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.
2142,Chett,Daenerys,The  blood of my enemies I will shed gladly.
2143,Chett,Daenerys,"Eight thousand strangled dogs.Your Grace,"
2144,Chett,Daenerys,"And you do have some dogs you want dead, as I recall."
2145,Chett,Daenerys,Yes.
2146,Chett,Daenerys,"You speak of sacking cities.Answer me this, ser - why have the Dothraki never sacked this city?"
2147,Chett,Daenerys,Look at the walls.
2148,Chett,Daenerys,"So  tell me, why is that ugly harpy not sitting beside the godsway in Vaes Dothrak among the other stolen  gods?You have a dragons eye, Khaleesi, thats plain to see.I wanted an answer, not a compliment.There are two reasons."
2149,Daenerys,Jorah,The Dothraki have not ridden against  Unsullied since they left their braids at the gates of Qohor.And the second reason?
2150,Daenerys,Jorah,Who would attack Astapor?
2151,Daenerys,Jorah,"Meereen and Yunkai are rivals but not enemies, the  Doom destroyed Valyria, the folk of the eastern hinterlands are all Ghiscari, and beyond the hills lies  Lhazar.The Lamb Men, as your Dothraki call them, a notably unwarlike people.Yes,but north of the slave cities is the Dothraki sea, and two dozen mighty khals who like  nothing more than sacking cities and carrying off their people into slavery.Carrying them off where?"
2152,Daenerys,Joffrey,"Its cheaper than fighting, and a deal more certain."
2153,Joffrey,Jorah,Khaleesi?
2154,Daenerys,Jorah,Viserys would have bought as many Unsullied as he had the coin for.
2155,Daenerys,Jorah,"I remember, Daenerys.Your Grace,Prince Rhaegar led free men into battle, not slaves.Whitebeard said he  dubbed his squires himself, and made many other knights as well.There was no higher honor than to receive your knighthood from the Prince of Dragonstone.Tell me, then - when he touched a man on the shoulder with his sword, what did he say?"
2156,Daenerys,Jorah,"At the Trident, those brave men Viserys spoke of who  died beneath our dragon banners - did they give their lives because they believed in Rhaegars cause, or  because they had been bought and paid for?"
2157,Daenerys,Robert,"My queen,"
2158,Daenerys,Robert,And Rhaegar died.
2159,Bran,Hodor,"Up and down,"
2160,Bran,Hodor,"I hate these stupid mountains of yours, Prince Bran.Yesterday you said you loved them.Oh, I do."
2161,Bran,Meera,I love them more than I  can say.
2162,Bran,Meera,But you just said you hated them.Why cant it be both?
2163,Bran,Meera,"Because theyre different,Like night and day, or ice and fire.If ice can burn,"
2164,Bran,Meera,"The land is one.One,but over wrinkled."
2165,Bran,Meera,"If we took the kingsroad we could be at the Wall by now,"
2166,Bran,Meera,"If we took the kingsroad we wouldnt be so hungry either,"
2167,Jojen,Meera,"Where you find roads you  find travelers,and travelers have eyes to see, and mouths to spread tales of  the crippled boy, his giant, and the wolf that walks beside them."
2168,Bran,Meera,Does no one live up here?
2169,Bran,Meera,"Theres people,The Umbers are mostly east of the kingsroad, but they graze their  sheep in the high meadows in summer.There are Wulls west of the mountains along the Bay of Ice,  Harclays back behind us in the hills, and Knotts and Liddles and Norreys and even some Flints up here  in the high places."
2170,Bran,Meera,Wull?
2171,Bran,Meera,"Jojen, wasnt there a Wull who rode with Father during the war?Theo Wull."
2172,Bran,Meera,"Buckets, they used to call him.Thats their sigil,Three brown buckets on a blue field, with a border of white and grey  checks."
2173,Bran,Jojen,"At Winterfell we called them lords, but their own folk dont."
2174,Bran,Jojen,Do you think these mountain folk know were here?They know.
2175,Bran,Jojen,They wont bother us so long as we dont try and make off with their goats or  horses.
2176,Bran,Hodor,"Come in and warm  yourselves,Theres stone enough to keep the rain off all our heads."
2177,Bran,Meera,Is it far to the Wall?
2178,Bran,Meera,"Not so far as the raven flies,Farther, for them as lacks  wings."
2179,Bran,Meera,.
2180,Craster,Qhorin,
2181,Jojen,Meera,"When there was a Stark in Winterfell, a maiden girl  could walk the kingsroad in her name-day gown and still go unmolested, and travelers could find fire,  bread, and salt at many an inn and holdfast."
2182,Bran,Jojen,"Theres  squids in the wolfswood, and flayed men ride the kingsroad asking after strangers."
2183,Bran,Jojen,Flayed men?
2184,Bran,Jojen,"The Bastards boys, aye."
2185,Bran,Jojen,"And paying good silver for wolfskins, a man  hears, and maybe gold for word of certain other walking dead."
2186,Bran,Jojen,"As to that Wall,"
2187,Hodor,Jojen,"Dark wings, dark words, me mother used to say, but when the  birds fly silent, seems to me thats even darker."
2188,Hodor,Jojen,"It was different when  there was a Stark in Winterfell.But the old wolfs dead and young ones gone south to play the game of  thrones, and all thats left us is the ghosts.The wolves will come again,And how would you be knowing, boy?I dreamed it.Some nights I dream of me mother that I buried nine years past,but when I wake, shes  not come back to us.There are dreams and dreams, my lord.Hodor,"
2189,Bran,Meera,"Look,an eagle."
2190,Hodor,Meera,"Its gone,Well see others,They live up here.I suppose.Hodor,Hodor,"
2191,Bran,Jojen,"Hodor likes it when you say his name, I think.Hodors not his true name,Its just some word he says."
2192,Nan,Walder,She was his grandmothers grandmother or something.
2193,Nan,Walder,Do you think the ironmen killed her?
2194,Jojen,Theon,"She never hurt no one, not even Theon."
2195,Jojen,Theon,"Would he?Some people hurt others just because they can,And it wasnt Theon who did the killing at Winterfell,Too many of the dead were  ironmen."
2196,Jojen,Meera,"Remember Old Nans stories, Bran."
2197,Jojen,Meera,"So long as you do that, part of her will always be alive in  you.Ill remember,"
2198,Hodor,Meera,Do you  know any stories?
2199,Hodor,Meera,"Oh, a few.A few,Hodor,You could tell one,While we walked."
2200,Hodor,Jojen,"I do, too.There are no knights in the Neck,Above the water,The bogs are full of dead ones, though.Thats true,Andals and ironmen, Freys and other fools, all those proud warriors who set  out to conquer Greywater."
2201,Bran,Jojen,And  sooner  or later they blunder into the bogs and sink beneath the weight of all that steel and drown there in their  armor.
2202,Bran,Jojen,"There was one knight,"
2203,Bran,Jojen,"He might have been a crannogman, that one.Or not."
2204,Bran,Jojen,"Prince Bran has heard that tale a hundred  times, Im sure.No,I havent."
2205,Bran,Meera,You have to visit them from time to time.Thats true.
2206,Craster,Qhorin,
2207,Bran,Meera,"He grew up hunting and fishing and climbing trees, and learned all the  magics of my people."
2208,Bran,Meera,"Did he have green dreams like Jojen?No,but he could breathe mud and run on leaves, and change earth to water and water to  earth with no more than a whispered word. Bran said plaintively."
2209,Bran,Meera,"Sooner if a certain prince would be quiet.I was just asking.The lad knew the magics of the crannogs,"
2210,Bran,Jojen,"But this lad was bolder than most, and one day when he had grown  to manhood he decided he would leave the crannogs and visit the Isle of Faces.No one visits the Isle of Faces,Thats where the green men live.It was the green men he meant to find.So he donned a shirt sewn with bronze scales, like mine, took up  a leathern shield and a threepronged spear, like mine, and paddled a little skin boat down the Green  Fork."
2211,Jojen,Meera,"He passed beneath the Twins by night so the Freys would not attack him, and when he reached the  Trident he climbed from the river and put his boat on his head and began to walk.It took him many a  day, but finally he reached the Gods Eye, threw his boat in the lake, and paddled out to the isle of  Faces.Did he meet the green men?Yes,but thats another story, and not for me to tell. she agreed, but said no more about them."
2212,Bran,Meera,"The towers reached ever  higher as he neared shore, until he realized that this must be the greatest castle in all the world.Harrenhal!"
2213,Bran,Meera,It was Harrenhal!
2214,Bran,Meera,Was it?
2215,Bran,Hodor,Part of him wanted nothing so much as to be part  of it.
2216,Bran,Hodor,"The daughter of the great castle reigned as queen of love and beauty when the tourney opened.Five  champions had sworn to defend her crown; her four brothers of Harrenhal, and her famous uncle, a white  knight of the Kingsguard.Was she a fair maid?She was,"
2217,Bran,Hodor,"The knights all begged them for  favors to tie about their lances.This isnt going to be one of those love stories, is it?"
2218,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor doesnt like those  so much.Hodor,He likes the stories where the knights fight monsters.Sometimes the knights are the monsters, Bran."
2219,Meera,Walder,"They snatched away his spear and knocked him to the ground, cursing  him for a frogeater.Were they Walders?"
2220,Meera,Walder,"None offered a name, but he marked their faces well so he could revenge himself upon them later."
2221,Meera,Walder,"Thats my fathers man youre kicking/ howled the she-wolf.A wolf on four legs, or two?Two,The she-wolf laid into the squires with a tourney sword, scattering them all."
2222,Meera,Walder,"That evening there was to be a feast in Harrenhal, to mark the opening of the tourney, and the she-wolf  insisted that the lad attend."
2223,Chett,Meera,"Under Harrens roof he ate and drank with the wolves, and many of their sworn swords besides,  barrowdown men and moose and bears and mermen."
2224,Bran,Chett,"Amidst all this merriment, the little crannogman spied the three squires whod attacked him.One served  a pitchfork knight, one a porcupine, while the last attended a knight with two towers on his surcoat, a sigil  all crannogmen know well.The Freys,The Freys of the Crossing.Then, as now,The wolf maid saw them too, and pointed them out to her brothers."
2225,Hodor,Jojen,  
2226,Hodor,Jojen,"It was Old Nan who told the stories.Meera, go on, you cant stop there. "
2227,Hodor,Jojen,"Hodor,Hodor hodor hodor hodor.Well,if you would hear the rest...Yes. she said...Never mind about all that."
2228,Bran,Hodor,Tell about the  jousting.As my prince commands.
2229,Bran,Harren,"But late on the  afternoon of that second day, as the shadows grew long, a mystery knight appeared in the lists."
2230,Barristan,Bran,"It was the little crannogman, I bet.No one knew,but the mystery knight was short of stature, and clad in ill-fitting armor  made up of bits and pieces. said Bran."
2231,Bran,Nan,I bet the old gods sent him.Perhaps they did.
2232,Bran,Nan,"You know the three he challenged.The porcupine knight, the pitchfork knight, and the knight of the twin towers."
2233,Bran,Nan,"He was the little crannogman, I told you.Whoever he was, the old gods gave strength to his arm."
2234,Bran,Meera,"And so the little  crannogmans prayer was answered ... by the green men, or the old gods, or the children of the forest,  who can say?"
2235,Bran,Meera,"Then what happened?Did  the Knight of the Laughing Tree win the tourney and marry a princess?No,That night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each  swore they would unmask him, and the king himself urged men to challenge him, declaring that the face  behind that helm was no friend of his."
2236,Bran,Jojen,it was the dragon prince who won that tourney in the end.Oh.
2237,Bran,Jojen,That was a good story.
2238,Bran,Jojen,"And the mystery knight should win the tourney, defeating every challenger,  and name the wolf maid the queen of love and beauty.She was,but thats a sadder story.Are you certain you never heard this tale before, Bran?"
2239,Bran,Jojen,Your lord father never told it to  you?
2240,Devan,Shireen,What news of the war?Is the king well?
2241,Salladhor,Shireen,What is the weather like?Have  the autumn storms begun yet?
2242,Chett,Davos,"Melisandre,Onion Knight,Are you well?Better than I was.Do you lack for anything?My king."
2243,Chett,Davos,I lack for them.
2244,Chett,Davos,Have you come to bum me?
2245,Chett,Jacelyn,"This is a bad place, is it not?"
2246,Chett,Jacelyn,"The good sun does not shine here, nor the bright moon."
2247,Chett,Jacelyn,"This is all that stands between you and the darkness, Onion Knight."
2248,Chett,Davos,Shall I put it out?No.
2249,Chett,Davos,Please.
2250,Davos,Melisandre,"So you have come to love the fire, it would seem.I need the torch."
2251,Davos,Melisandre,"I am like this torch, Ser Davos."
2252,Davos,Melisandre,Do you believe that?No.
2253,Davos,Melisandre,"You are the mother of darkness.I saw that under Storms End, when you  gave birth before my eyes.Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow?"
2254,Davos,Melisandre,It  might well kill him.
2255,Davos,Melisandre,"With another man, though ... a man whose flames still  bum hot and high ... if you truly wish to serve your kings cause, come to my chamber one night.  "
2256,Davos,Melisandre,a horror.
2257,Davos,Melisandre,"I want no part of you, my lady."
2258,Davos,Melisandre,May the Seven  protect me.
2259,Davos,Melisandre,They did not protect Guncer Sunglass.
2260,Davos,Melisandre,"Why cling to these false gods?I have worshiped them all my life.All your life, Davos Seaworth?As well say it was so yesterday."
2261,Davos,Melisandre,"You have  never feared to speak the truth to kings, why do you lie to yourself?Open your eyes, ser knight.What is it you would have me see?The way the world is made."
2262,Chett,Davos,Evil  and good.
2263,Chett,Davos,Death and life.
2264,Chett,Davos,"Everywhere, the war.The war?"
2265,Chett,Davos,"The war,There are two, Onion Knight."
2266,Chett,Melisandre,"Darkness, or light."
2267,Melisandre,Salladhor,"So tell me, Ser Davos Seaworth, and tell me truly - does your heart burn with the shining light of Rhllor?Or is it black and cold and full of worms?"
2268,Melisandre,Salladhor,"My heart,is full of doubts."
2269,Melisandre,Salladhor,"Ahhhh, Davos."
2270,Melisandre,Salladhor,"The Others servants oft hide black hearts in gaudy  light, so Rhllor gives his priests the power to see through falsehoods."
2271,Melisandre,Salladhor,"Why did you mean to kill me?I will tell you,if you will tell me who betrayed me."
2272,Melisandre,Salladhor,"No one betrayed you, onion knight.I saw your purpose in my flames."
2273,Melisandre,Salladhor,"If you can see the future in these flames, how is it that we burned upon the Blackwater?  Melisandre shook her head."
2274,Davos,Melisandre,"His punishment was grievous, but he has learned from his  mistake."
2275,Davos,Stannis,"It is night in your Seven Kingdoms now,"
2276,Davos,Stannis,Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn!
2277,Davos,Melisandre,You do not believe me.
2278,Davos,Melisandre,"And because Rhllor is the source of all good, I shall leave the torch as well."
2279,Axell,Porridge,.
2280,Axell,Porridge,madness!
2281,Axell,Porridge,"Axell,for the love you bear me, unhand me!"
2282,Davos,Porridge,"Where is Selyse, where is the queen?"
2283,Davos,Porridge,Release me!
2284,Davos,Porridge,Here?
2285,Axell,Porridge,Let the traitors enjoy each others company.I am no traitor!
2286,Axell,Davos,"No,Nooooo. "
2287,Axell,Porridge,"You cannot do this,I am the Kings Hand!"
2288,Alester,Davos,You are Alester Florent.
2289,Alester,Davos,Who ...?Ser Davos Seaworth.
2290,Alester,Davos,Seaworth ... the onion knight.You tried to murder Melisandre.
2291,Alester,Davos,"At Storms End you wore red-gold armor, with inlaid lapis flowers on your  breastplate."
2292,Alester,Davos,I ...
2293,Alester,Davos,I escaped with no more than the mail on my  back and the rings on my fingers.
2294,Alester,Davos,"No doubt some cooks boy or groom is prancing around Kings Landing just now in my slashed velvet  doublet and jeweled cloak,But war has its horrors, as all men know.No doubt you suffered your own losses.My ship,All my men.Four of my sons.May the ... may the Lord of Light lead them through the darkness to a better world,"
2295,Alester,Davos,"My own son is safe at Brightwater,but I lost a nephew on the Fury."
2296,Davos,Melisandre,My son  Maric was your nephews oarmaster.
2297,Davos,Melisandre,"Has  there been any word of survivors?The Fury burned and sank with all hands,Your son and my nephew were lost, with  countless other good men.The war itself was lost that day, ser."
2298,Alester,Small,"His Grace will never yield, my lord.Folly, thats folly."
2299,Alester,Salladhor,Stannis Baratheon will never sit the Iron Throne.
2300,Alester,Joffrey,.Even the lords of the narrow sea?The lords sworn to Dragonstone?
2301,Alester,Joffrey,Lord Celtigar was captured and bent the knee.
2302,Davos,Stannis,"Gods be good, how can they call it treason?"
2303,Davos,Stannis,"My lord, what did you do?Not treason."
2304,Salladhor,Tywin,yes.
2305,Salladhor,Tywin,I penned a letter.
2306,Alester,Tywin,"His lordship is a ... a man of  reason, and my terms ... the terms were fair ... more than fair.What terms were these, my lord?it is fllthy here,And that odor ... what is that odor?The pail,We have no privy here.What terms?"
2307,Davos,Tywin,"That Lord Stannis give up his claim to the Iron Throne and  retract all he said of Joffreys bastardy, on the condition that he be accepted back into the kings peace  and confirmed as Lord of Dragonstone and Storms End."
2308,Stannis,Tywin,I offered to seal the bargain by wedding Shireen to  Joffreys brother Tommen.
2309,Stannis,Tywin,"The terms ... they are as good as we are ever like to  get.Even you can see that, surely? Yes,even me."
2310,Shireen,Stannis,"And what did His Grace say when you proposed these terms to him?He is always with the red woman, and ... he is not in his right mind, I fear."
2311,Davos,Stannis,The Hand speaks with the kings voice.Not in this.
2312,Davos,Joffrey,"It is not in Stannis to yield, so long as he knows his claim is just."
2313,Alester,Joffrey,"As for the marriage, Tornmen was born of the  same incest as Joffrey, and His Grace would sooner see Shireen dead than wed to such."
2314,Alester,Joffrey,"He has no choice.You are wrong, my lord.He can choose to die a king.And us with him?Is that what you desire, Onion Knight?No.But I am the kings man, and I will make no peace without his leave."
2315,Alester,Luwin,"I am going up the hill to look for  Ghost,"
2316,Jon,Ygritte,"Like the night you  stole me.The Thief was bright that night.I never meant to steal you,I never knew you were a girl until my knife was at your throat.If you kill a man, and never mean t, hes just as dead,"
2317,Jon,Theon,Do you have names for them as well?
2318,Chett,Jon,The She-Wolf?
2319,Chett,Jon,"Ghost,"
2320,Jon,Mance,Do you  understand?
2321,Jon,Mance,"You cannot come with me,You have to go to Castle Black."
2322,Jon,Mance,"They will know you at Castle  Black, and maybe your coming will warn them."
2323,Chett,Jon,"I will meet you again at Castle Black, but you have to get there by yourself."
2324,Chett,Jon,Alone.
2325,Chett,Jon,Isnt that good?
2326,Eddard,Jon,Isnt that sweet?
2327,Eddard,Jon,"Not so fast, oh, slow, yes, like that."
2328,Eddard,Jon,Yessss.
2329,Jon,Mag,"Snow,Come.Magnar wants."
2330,Dalla,Mance,pet
2331,Jon,Mag,"Jarl has warned me of crows, patrolling on high.Tell me all you know of these  patrols."
2332,Styr,Ygritte,"There are four men in each patrol, two rangers and two  builders,The builders are supposed to make note of cracks, melting, and other structural  problems, while the rangers look for signs of foes.They ride mules.Mules?"
2333,Styr,Ygritte,"Mules are slow.Slow, but more surefooted on the ice."
2334,Jon,Mag,"The mules are bred at Eastwatch, and  specially trained to their duty.They often ride atop the Wall?Not always?No.One patrol in four follows the base instead, to search for cracks in the foundation ice or signs of  tunneling."
2335,Jon,Mag,Even in far Therm we know the tale of Arson Iceaxe and his tunnel.
2336,Jon,Mag,When do these patrols go out?How often?
2337,Jon,Mag,It changes.
2338,Jarl,Jon,And sometimes the Old Bear will even send a larger force to one of  the abandoned castles for a fortnight or a moons turn.
2339,Jarl,Jon,Is Stonedoor manned at present?
2340,Jarl,Jon,Greyguard?
2341,Jon,Styr,"Only Eastwatch, Castle Black,  and the Shadow Tower were manned when I left the Wall.I cant speak to what Bowen Marsh or Ser  Denys might have done since.How many crows remain within the castles?"
2342,Jon,Styr,"Five hundred at Castle Black.Two hundred at Shadow Tower, perhaps three hundred at Eastwatch."
2343,Jarl,Styr,"Hes lying,Or else including those they lost on the Fist.Crow,do not take me for Mance Rayder."
2344,Jon,Mag,"We shall learn their numbers soon enough,Go.I will send for you if I have further questions."
2345,Grigg,Jon,"She took a  torch and went off that way,"
2346,Jon,Ygritte,"Ygritte?In here,"
2347,Jon,Ygritte,What are you doing here?
2348,Jon,Ygritte,I heard water.I wanted tsee how deep the cave went.
2349,Jon,Ygritte,"Theres a passage  goes down further.I followed it a hundred paces before I turned back.A dead end?You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2350,Jon,Ygritte,"Gornes Way.Gorne,Gorne was King-beyond-the-Wall.Aye,Together with his brother Gendel, three thousand years ago."
2351,Gendel,Jon,"But when they come out, the wolves o    Winterfell fell upon them.There was a battle,Gorne slew the King in the North, but his son picked up his banner  and took the crown from his head, and cut down Gorne in turn.And the sound o swords woke the crows in their castles, and they rode out all in black to take the free  folk in the rear.Yes."
2352,Gendel,Jon,"He  died as well.You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2353,Gendel,Jon,"Only Gendel did not know the caves as Gorne  had, and took a wrong turn."
2354,Gendel,Jon,"Deeper he went, and deeper, and when he tried t turn back the ways that seemed familiar ended in  stone rather than sky."
2355,Gendel,Jon,Do you hear them?
2356,Jon,Ygritte,"This way under the Wall was  lost as well?Some have searched for it.Them that go too deep find Gendels children, and Gendels children are  always hungry."
2357,Jon,Ygritte,"Theres naught to eat in the dark but flesh,"
2358,Jon,Ygritte,"You sound like Old Nan, telling Bran a  monster story."
2359,Jon,Ygritte,"An old woman, am FYoure older than me.Aye, and wiser.You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2360,Jon,Ygritte,What are you doing?Showing you how old I am.
2361,Jon,Ygritte,I want you should see me.We shouldnt - We should.
2362,Jon,Ygritte,"You as well,If you want to look you have to show.You know nothing, Jon Snow.I know I want you,"
2363,Chett,Ygritte,"I love the smell of you,I love your red hair."
2364,Jon,Ygritte,I love your teats.
2365,Jon,Ygritte,"I love your skinny legs, and whats between them."
2366,Jon,Ygritte,"If you love me all so much, why are  you still dressed?"
2367,Jon,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2368,Jon,Ygritte,OHHH.
2369,Jon,Ygritte,"That thing you did,With your ...mouth."
2370,Jon,Ygritte,"Is that ... is it what lords do to  their ladies, down in the south?I dont think so."
2371,Jon,Ygritte,"I only ... wanted to  kiss you there, thats all.You seemed to like it.Aye."
2372,Jon,Ygritte,"No one taught you such?Theres been no one,Only you.A maid,You were a maid."
2373,Jon,Ygritte,I was a man of the Nights Watch.
2374,Jon,Ygritte,Were you a maid?
2375,Jon,Ygritte,"I am nineteen, and a spearwife, and kissed by fire.How could I  be maiden?Who was he?A boy at a feast, five years past."
2376,Jon,Ygritte,"When he came back t try and steal me,  Longspear broke his arm and ran him off, and he never tried again, not once.It wasnt Longspear, then?"
2377,Jon,Ygritte,Thats vile.Would you bed your sister?Longspears not your brother.Hes of my village.
2378,Chett,Jon,"Even monsters.Craster weds his daughters,"
2379,Chett,Jon,Crasters more your kind than ours.
2380,Chett,Jon,"Crasters blood is black, and he  bears a heavy curse."
2381,Chett,Jon,I feared youd do the same once.
2382,Chett,Jon,You never knew what t do after you stole me.
2383,Chett,Jon,"Ygritte, I never stole you.Aye, you did."
2384,Jon,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
2385,Jon,Ygritte,"You  might be learning some, though."
2386,Jon,Ygritte,We had best go up.The  torch is almost done.Is the crow afeared o Gendels children?
2387,Jon,Ygritte,"Its only a little way up, and Im not  done with you, Jon Snow."
2388,Jon,Ygritte,Would you .
2389,Jon,Ygritte,. 
2390,Jon,Ygritte,What?
2391,Jon,Ygritte,Do it again?
2392,Jon,Ygritte,With your mouth?
2393,Jon,Ygritte,I could see if you liked it  any.
2394,Jarl,Styr,"Jon Snow,"
2395,Gendel,Jon,Not ever.
2396,Gendel,Jon,All?
2397,Daenerys,Jon,"Your Grace, did this ones worthless ears mishear you?"
2398,Daenerys,Jon,"Your ears heard true,I want to buy them all.Tell the  Good Masters, if you will."
2399,Jorah,Kraznys,"All,"
2400,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Of thousands, there are eight."
2401,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Would she have them too?I would,The eight  thousands, the six centuries ... and the ones still in training as well.The ones who have not earned the  spikes."
2402,Daenerys,Groleo,"We cannot sell half-trained boys,We can, if her gold is good,They are not Unsullied."
2403,Chett,Daenerys,"What would we tell the next buyer who comes seeking Unsullied?We will tell him that he must wait,Gold in my purse is better than gold in my future."
2404,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell her that the eight thousands she shall have, if  her gold proves sufficient."
2405,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell her to come back in a year, and we    will sell her another two thousand.in a year I shall be in Westeros,My need is now The  Unsullied are well trained, but even so, many will fall in battle.I shall need the boys as replacements to  take up the swords they drop."
2406,Daenerys,Kraznys,Tell the Good  Masters that I will want even the little ones who still have their puppies.Tell them that I will pay as much  for the boy they cut yesterday as for an Unsullied in a spiked helm.
2407,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Very well.Tell them I will pay double, so long as I get them all.Double?"
2408,Daenerys,Kraznys,"This little whore is a fool, truly,Ask her for triple, I say."
2409,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Ask for ten times the price of every slave, yes."
2410,Daenerys,Viserys,"Your Grace,"
2411,Daenerys,Viserys,"Are you  having gold and trading goods sufficient to be paying for all these eunuchs you are wanting?You know the answer to that better than I, Good Master,Your men have gone through  my ships and tallied every bead of amber and jar of saffron.How much do I have?Sufficient to be buying one of thousands,Yet you  are paying double, you are saying.Five centuries, then, is all you buy.Your pretty crown might buy another century,Your crown of the three  dragons."
2412,Daenerys,Viserys,My crown is not for sale.
2413,Groleo,Viserys,"Nor will I enslave my people, nor sell  their goods and horses."
2414,Groleo,Viserys,The great cog Balerion and the galleys Vhagar and  Meraxes.
2415,Daenerys,Groleo,Three good ships should be worth more than a few paltry  eunuchs.
2416,Daenerys,Groleo,"Two of the thousands,It is too much, but the Good Masters are being  generous and your need is being great."
2417,Jhiqui,Kraznys,"Give me  all,and you may have a dragon."
2418,Jhiqui,Kraznys,"Did I not  tell you?Anything, she would give us."
2419,Jhiqui,Kraznys,No.
2420,Jhiqui,Kraznys,"Your Grace, I beg you, win your throne with  dragons, not slaves.  Ser Jorah, remove Whitebeard from my presence."
2421,Daenerys,Kraznys,"Tell the Good Masters I regret this interruption,Tell them I await their  answer."
2422,Arstan,Daenerys,"A dragon of our choice,The black one is largest and healthiest.His name is Drogon."
2423,Arstan,Daenerys,"All your goods, save your crown and your queenly raiment, which we will allow you to keep."
2424,Arstan,Daenerys,"And Drogon.Done,Done,"
2425,Arstan,Daenerys,"Done,and done, and  done, eight times done.The Unsullied will learn your savage tongue quick enough,but until such time you will need a slave to speak to them."
2426,Chett,Daenerys,"Whitebeard,"
2427,Daenerys,Missandei,"Is that understood?Yes, Your Grace,I am not a child,I am a queen.Yet even queens can err."
2428,Daenerys,Missandei,"Aegon proved that three hundred years ago, upon the Field of Fire.I know what Aegon proved.I mean to prove a few things of my own."
2429,Daenerys,Missandei,"Do you have a name, or must you draw a new one every  day from some barrel?That is only for Unsullied,"
2430,Missandei,Rakharo,Oh.Your name is Oh?No.
2431,Missandei,Rakharo,. Missandei is no longer a slave.
2432,Daenerys,Rakharo,"Come ride with me in the litter, I wish to  talk."

2434,Daenerys,Missandei,"I will serve you,  gladly.I can give you freedom, but not safety,I have a world to cross and wars to fight."
2435,Daenerys,Missandei,"You may be killed.Valar morghuhs,All men must die,but not for a long while, we may pray."
2436,Daenerys,Missandei,"Are these Unsullied truly fearless?Yes, Your Grace.You serve me now.is it true they feel no pain?The wine of courage kills such feelings.By the time they slay their sucklings, they have been drinking it  for years.And they are obedient?Obedience is all they know.If you told them not to breathe, they would find that easier than not to  obey."
2437,Daenerys,Missandei,"And when I am done with them?Your Grace?When I have won my war and claimed the throne that was my fathers, my knights will sheathe their  swords and return to their keeps, to their  wives and children and mothers ... to their lives."
2438,Daenerys,Missandei,"What am I to do with  eight thousand eunuchs when there are no more battles to be fought?The Unsullied make flne guards and excellent watchmen, Your Grace,And it is never  hard to find a buyer for such fine well-blooded troops.Men are not bought and sold in Westeros, they tell me.With all respect, Your Grace, Unsullied are not men.If I did resell them, how would I know they could not be used against me?"
2439,Daenerys,Missandei,"Would they do that?Fight against me, even do me harm?If their master commanded."
2440,Daenerys,Missandei,They obey.
2441,Daenerys,Missandei,"When you are ... when you are done with them ...Your Grace  might command them to fall upon their swords.And even that, they would do?Yes."
2442,Daenerys,Missandei,Your Grace.
2443,Daenerys,Missandei,"You would sooner I did not ask it of them, though."
2444,Daenerys,Missandei,Why do you  care?This one does not ...

2460,Irri,Jhiqui,Khaleesi?
2461,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Khaleesi, are you unwell?"
2462,Daenerys,Jhiqui,A dream.
2463,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"I dreamed a dream, no more."
2464,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"All of us, go back  to sleep."
2465,Daenerys,Missandei,"The  Good Masters place them so they will be the first thing a new slave sees upon entering the city,"
2466,Daenerys,Missandei,What did this one do?He raised a hand against his owner.
2467,Jorah,Missandei,Here  they are.
2468,Jorah,Missandei,"Tell her they are hers ... if she can pay.She can,"

2493,Sansa,Willas,Yes.
2494,Sansa,Willas,It seems almost obscene to squander such sweet  innocence on that gargoyle.What gargoyle?

2497,Cersei,Sansa,"Youre prettier with your mouth closed, Sansa,Come along now, the septon is  waiting.And the wedding guests as well.No,No.Yes."

2499,Sansa,Willas,I wont.
2500,Meryn,Osmund,"Hes a  loathsome little imp, no doubt of it, but marry him you shall.You cant make me.Of course we can.You may come along quietly and say your vows as befits a lady, or you may struggle    and scream and make a spectacle for the stableboys to titter over, but you will end up wedded and  bedded all the same."
2501,Meryn,Osmund,"Escort Lady Sansa to the sept,Carry her if you must, but try not to tear the gown, it was very costly-,,  Sansa tried to run, but Cerseis handmaid caught her before shed gone a yard.Do as youre told,  sweetling, it wont be so bad."
2502,Boros,Cersei,Ill go.
2503,Cersei,Meryn,I knew you would.
2504,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Im your father today,Youre not,Youll never be."
2505,Joffrey,Tyrion,I am.
2506,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Youll  marry the pig boy if I say so, and bed down with him in the sty."
2507,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Or maybe I should give you to Ilyn Payne, would you like him better?"
2508,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Please, Your Grace,If you ever loved me even a little bit, dont make  me marry your  uncle?Your Grace,Grant  me a moment alone with Lady Sansa, if you would be so kind?"
2509,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You are very beautiful, Sansa,It is good of you to say so, my lord."
2510,Lancel,Willas,"My lady, this is no way to bring you to your wedding."
2511,Lancel,Willas,"Else I would have come to  you sooner, as I wished."
2512,Lancel,Willas,"You did not ask for this marriage, I know."
2513,Lancel,Willas,"If that is your wish, say so, and I will end this  farce."
2514,Dontos,Tyrion,"You are kind, my lord,I am a ward of the throne and  my duty is to marry as the king commands."
2515,Dontos,Tyrion,"I know I am not the sort of husband young girls dream of,  Sansa,but neither am I Joffrey.No,You were kind to me.I remember."
2516,Dontos,Tyrion,"Come, then.Let us do our duty."
2517,Joffrey,Sansa,"Dontos, down on your hands and knees,My uncle  needs a boost to climb his bride."
2518,Sansa,Small,"With this kiss I pledge my love, and take you for my lord and  husband.With this kiss I pledge my love,and take you for my lady and wife."
2519,Sansa,Small,"Here in the sight of gods  and men,I do solemnly proclaim Tyrion of House Lannister and Sansa of House Stark to be  man and wife, one flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever, and cursed be the one who comes  between them."
2520,Joffrey,Tyrion,"My lord, should we  lead the dance?"
2521,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I think we have already given them sufficent amusement for one day, dont you?As you say, my lord."
2522,Dontos,Garlan,Lady Sansa.
2523,Dontos,Garlan,Would you honor me?If your lord consents?
2524,Dontos,Garlan,My lady can dance with whomever she pleases.
2525,Margaery,Willas,"I see why they name you Garlan  the Gallant, ser,My lady is gracious to say so."
2526,Garlan,Willas,To protect me.To protect you?
2527,Garlan,Sansa,"I was a plump little boy, I fear, and we do have an uncle called Garth the Gross.So Willas struck first, though not before threatening me with Garlan the Greensick, Garlan the Galling,  and Garlan the Gargoyle."
2528,Garlan,Loras,"My lady wife is most  concerned for you,Lady Leonette is too sweet.Tell her I am well.A bride at her wedding should be more than well."
2529,Garlan,Loras,"You seemed close to  tears.Tears of joy, ser.Your eyes give the lie to your tongue."
2530,Garlan,Loras,"My lady, I  have seen how you look at my brother."
2531,Sansa,Tommen,"I want to be married  too,Im taller than my uncle! I know you are,"
2532,Aegon,Sansa,"You  shouldnt look so sad.My uncle is an ugly little thing, but youll still have me.Youre to marry Margaery!A king can have other women."
2533,Aegon,Joffrey,He had lots of whores and lots of bastards.
2534,Joffrey,Sansa,My uncle will bring you to my bed whenever I command it.
2535,Joffrey,Sansa,"He wont.He will, or Ill have his head.That King Aegon, he had any woman he wanted, whether they were  married or no."
2536,Craster,Qhorin,Its time to bed  them!
2537,Joffrey,Sansa,Ill have no bedding.
2538,Joffrey,Sansa,You will if I command it.
2539,Joffrey,Sansa,"Then youll service your own  bride with a wooden prick.Ill geld you, I swear it."
2540,Cersei,Tywin,Did you hear him?
2541,Sansa,Tywin,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding.Tyrion, I am certain you did  not mean to threaten the kings royal person."
2542,Joffrey,Sansa,"I misspoke,It was a bad jape,  sire.You threatened to geld me!"
2543,Joffrey,Sansa,"I did, Your Grace,but only because I envied your royal manhood."
2544,Joffrey,Osmund,"And if you take my tongue, you will leave me no way at all to  pleasure this sweet wife you gave me."
2545,Joffrey,Tywin,"Your Grace,my son is drunk, you can see that.I am,but not so drunk that I cannot attend to my own bedding."
2546,Sansa,Small,"Come, wife, time to smash your portcullis.I want to play  come-into-the-castle."
2547,Sansa,Tyrion,"There is a flagon of good Arbor gold on the sideboard,  Sansa.Will you be so kind as to pour me a cup?Is that wise, my lord?Nothing was ever wiser."
2548,Sansa,Tyrion,But I mean to be.
2549,Sansa,Tyrion,"Would you have me undress, my lord?Tyrion."
2550,Sansa,Tyrion,"My name is Tyrion, Sansa.Tyrion."
2551,Sansa,Tyrion,"Should I take off my gown, or do you want to undress me?"
2552,Sansa,Tyrion,"The first time I wed, there was us and a drunken septon, and some pigs  to bear witness."
2553,Sansa,Tyrion,"Tysha fed me crackling and I licked  the grease off her fingers, and we were laughing when we fell into bed.You were wed before?"
2554,Sansa,Tyrion,"I had forgotten.You did not forget.You never knew.Who was she, my lord?"
2555,Sansa,Tyrion,Lady Tysha.
2556,Sansa,Tyrion,Of House Silverfist.
2557,Sansa,Tyrion,"Ours was a very short marriage ... as befits a very short man, I suppose."
2558,Sansa,Tyrion,"How old are you, Sansa?"
2559,Sansa,Tyrion,"Thirteen,when the moon turns.Gods have mercy."
2560,Sansa,Tyrion,"Well, talk wont make you older."
2561,Sansa,Tyrion,if it please you?It will please me to please my lord husband.
2562,Sansa,Tyrion,"You hide behind courtesy as if it were a castle wall.Courtesy is a ladys armor,"
2563,Sansa,Tyrion,I am your husband.You can take off your armor now.And my clothing?That too.

2577,Mordane,Sansa,"On my honor as a Lannister,I will not touch you until you want me to.And if I never want  you to, my lord?"
2578,Arya,Harwin,Never?
2579,Arya,Harwin,"Why,that is why the gods made whores for imps like me."
2580,Arya,Harwin,"The Mad Kings men had been hunting Robert, trying to catch him before he could rejoin your father,He was wounded, being tended by some friends, when Lord  Connington the Hand took the town with a mighty force and started searching house by house."

2692,Brienne,Jaime,Lord Bolton holds this castle.The Boltons are bannermen to the Starks.The Boltons skin their enemies.
2693,Brienne,Robb,"The banners,Flayed man and twin towers, see."
2694,Jaime,Robb,They fly the direwolf.
2695,Jaime,Robb,"Thats your bloody wolf, true enough,And  those are heads to either side of it."
2696,Harren,Jaime,"I am bearing Kingslayers banner,"
2697,Jaime,Vargo,"I give you the Kingthlayer,"
2698,Jaime,Walder,"A fury of Freys,Ser Danwell, Ser Aenys,  Ser Hosteen."
2699,Danwell,Jaime,"You have my  condolences.For what, ser?"
2700,Danwell,Jaime,"Your brothers son, Ser Cleos,He was with us until outlaws filled him full of arrows.Urswyck and this lot took his goods and left him for the wolves.My lords!"
2701,Aenys,Brienne,I saw your banners.Hear me for your  oath!Who speaks?
2702,Aenys,Jaime,"Lannitherth wet nurth.I am Brienne of Tarth, daughter to Lord Selwyn the Evenstar, and sworn to House Stark even as you  are."
2703,Aenys,Jaime,"Thats for your oaths.We trusted the word of Robb Stark, and he repaid our  faith with betrayal."
2704,Aenys,Brienne,I know of no betrayal.
2705,Aenys,Danwell,"Lady Catelyn commanded me to deliver Larmister to his brother at Kings Landing - She was trying to drown him when we found them,"
2706,Aenys,Danwell,"In anger I forgot myself, but I would never have killed him.if he dies the Lannisters will  put my ladys daughters to the sword."
2707,Aenys,Danwell,"Why should that trouble us?Ransom him back to Riverrun,Casterly Rock has more gold,Kill him!"
2708,Danwell,Shagwell,His head for Eddard Starks!
2709,Roose,Vargo,"There once was a lion who danced with a bear, oh my, oh my...Thilenth, fool."
2710,Roose,Vargo,The Kingthlayer ith not for the bear.He ith mine.He is no ones should he die.
2711,Jaime,Roose,"And pray  recall, my lord, you are not master of Harrenhal till I march north."
2712,Jaime,Roose,Can this be the Lord of the Dreadfort?
2713,Jaime,Vargo,When did you stop  runnin& my lord?
2714,Eddard,Roose,"You have lost a hand.No,I have it here, hanging round my neck."
2715,Eddard,Roose,Take this away.The sight  of it offends me.I will thend it to hith lord father.
2716,Brienne,Robb,"And when we hath hith gold, we thall deliver Ther Jaime to  Karthark, and collect a maiden too!"
2717,Brienne,Robb,"A fine plan,A fine wine,"
2718,Brienne,Robb,"As to Lord Tywin, he remains at Kings Landing, and there he will stay till the new  year, when his grandson takes for bride a daughter of Highgarden.Winterfell,You mean Winterfell.King Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark.No longer."
2719,Brienne,Jaime,"The rose and  the lion joined there, to shatter Stannis Baratheons host and bum his fleet to ashes."
2720,Brienne,Jaime,Is there word of my sister?
2721,Brienne,Jaime,She is well.
2722,Brienne,Jaime,nephew.
2723,Brienne,Jaime,"Your brother also lives, though he took a wound in the battle."
2724,Brienne,Vargo,"Escort Ser Jaime to Qybum.And unbind this womans hands.Pray forgive us, my lady."
2725,Brienne,Vargo,"My lord, these men tried  to rape me.Did they?"
2726,Brienne,Vargo,"I am displeased.By that, and this of Ser  Jaimes hand."
2727,Amabel,Brienne,"They took my sword,my armor...You shall have no need of armor here, my lady,In Harrenhal, you are under my  protection."
2728,Amabel,Brienne,"Walton, you will see to Ser Jaime at once."
2729,Brienne,Jaime,That bad?Will I die?
2730,Brienne,Jaime,No. He sliced away Jaimes sleeve.
2731,Brienne,Jaime,"The safest course would be to take the arm off.Then youll die,Clean the stump and sew it up.Ill take my chances."
2732,Jaime,Qyburn,"I can leave you the upper arm, make the cut at your elbow, but ."
2733,Jaime,Qyburn,". Take any part of my arm, and youd best chop off the other one as well, or Ill strangle you with it  afterward."
2734,Jaime,Qyburn,Very well.
2735,Jaime,Qyburn,  
2736,Jaime,Qyburn,There will be pain.Ill scream.A great deal of pain.Ill scream very loudly.Will you take some wine at least?Does the High Septon ever pray?Of that I am not certain.
2737,Jaime,Qyburn,"Lie back, I must needs strap down your arm."
2738,Jaime,Qyburn,"I left a flap of skin  to fold back over your wrist.You have done this before,"
2739,Jaime,Qyburn,No man who serves with Vargo Hoat is a stranger to stumps.He makes them wherever he goes.
2740,Jaime,Qyburn,How does a maester come to ride with the Brave Companions?The Citadel took my chain.
2741,Jaime,Qyburn,I should do something about that wound  above your eye as well.The flesh is badly inflamed.
2742,Harren,Qyburn,Tell me of the battle.
2743,Jaime,Qyburn,Lord Stannis was caught between your father and the fire.Its said the Imp set the river itself aflame.
2744,Jaime,Qyburn,Open your eye.
2745,Jaime,Qyburn,How  did you come by this one?
2746,Jaime,Qyburn,"A wenchs gift.Rough wooing, my lord?This wench is bigger than me and uglier than you."
2747,Jaime,Qyburn,Shes still limping on the  leg I pricked when we fought.I will ask after her.What is this woman to you?My protector.
2748,Jaime,Qyburn,"Ill grind some herbs you can mix with wine to bring down your fever.Come back on the morrow and  Ill put a leech on your eye to drain the bad blood.A leech.Lovely.Lord Bolton is very fond of leeches,Yes,He would be."
2749,Bronn,Tyrion,"They come back quicker than the rats,We burned them out once, youd think theyd  take that as a lesson.Give me a few dozen gold cloaks and Ill kill them all,Once theyre dead they dont come  back.No, but others come in their places."
2750,Bronn,Kevan,"The wars not done yet, no matter what these fools may think."
2751,Bronn,Kevan,I have seen enough for now.Well return on the morrow with the guild  masters to go over their plans.
2752,Bronn,Tyrion,"Remind me to tell Ser Addam to post some gold cloaks here,Some fool boys like to fall off and break his back."
2753,Sansa,Tyrion,"On second thoughts,let the poxy brats  splatter on the cobbles like overripe melons."
2754,Sansa,Shae,"Wait,"
2755,Sansa,Shae,.
2756,Sansa,Shae,I know.
2757,Sansa,Shae,How could you know?Did  Varys tell you?Some page was telling Ser Tallad about it when I took Lollys to the sept.He had it from this serving girl  who heard Ser Kevan talking to your father.
2758,Sansa,Shae,I dont care.
2759,Sansa,Shae,Youll give her a big  belly and come back to me.
2760,Bronn,Tyrion,"This way,If you still mean to ...?I do."
2761,Bronn,Tyrion,Theres two jags and then a dead end.The sink is in the cellar of the last building.
2762,Bronn,Tyrion,See that no one enters or leaves till I return.This wont take long.
2763,Bronn,Tyrion,In the back.
2764,Shae,Tyrion,Symon Silver Tongue.
2765,Shae,Tyrion,"My lord Hand,You mistake me."
2766,Shae,Tyrion,"I am no longer even a finger, I fear.You shall rise again, I am sure."
2767,Symon,Tyrion,"I should have been honored to sing at your feast.The last thing my wife needs is more songs,As for Shae, we both know she is no lady,  and I would thank you never to speak her name aloud.As the Hand commands,"
2768,Symon,Tyrion,"I am told you are a very gifted singer.You are most kind to say so, my lord."
2769,Symon,Tyrion,"I think it is time you brought your music to the Free Cities.They are great  lovers of song in Braavos and Pentos and Lys, and generous with those who please them."
2770,Symon,Tyrion,A tour of all nine cities would be best.
2771,Symon,Tyrion,A year in each should suffice.
2772,Symon,Tyrion,"With the port closed, you will need to go to Duskendale to take ship, but my man  Bronn will find a horse for you, and I would be honored if you would let me pay your passage ."
2773,Symon,Tyrion,". But my lord,you have never heard me sing."
2774,Symon,Tyrion,"Theres more,"
2775,Symon,Tyrion,  
2776,Symon,Tyrion,Thats not a song I would care to hear again.Ever.No?
2777,Symon,Tyrion,A pity.
2778,Symon,Tyrion,"Or your lord father.My father has no time for singers, and my sister is not  as generous as one might think."
2779,Symon,Tyrion,"You will find my price modest, my lord.Thats good to know."
2780,Symon,Tyrion,"Tell me.At King Joffreys wedding feast,there is to be a tournament of singers.And jugglers, and jesters, and dancing bears.Only one dancing bear, my lord,but seven singers."
2781,Symon,Tyrion,I am prepared to prove the truth of my boast before king and court.
2782,Symon,Tyrion,"if you understand one  word in three, count yourself fortunate.My sweet sister has arranged the feast."
2783,Cersei,Symon,"What would  the High Septon think?You did not strike me as a pious man, my lord.Piety is not the point.Certain forms must be observed."
2784,Cersei,Symon,Still ... a singers life is not without peril.
2785,Cersei,Symon,"If one of your sisters seven should suffer some mishap, I hope you  might consider me to fill his place."
2786,Cersei,Symon,"Six singers would be as unfortunate as eight, to be sure."
2787,Cersei,Symon,"If any of them should be indisposed, my man Bronn will find you.Very good, my lord."
2788,Bronn,Tyrion,"For hands of gold are always cold, but a womans hands are warm.That will not be necessary,You have my word as a Lannister, Bronn will call upon you  soon.Very good, my lord."
2789,Bronn,Tyrion,When do  I take the man to Duskendale?You dont.
2790,Bronn,Tyrion,"Give him three days, then inform him that Hamish the Harper has  broken his arm."
2791,Bronn,Tyrion,Hell come with you quick enough.
2792,Bronn,Tyrion,"You may want his tongue, I understand its  made of silver.The rest of him should never be found."
2793,Bronn,Tyrion,"Theres a pot shop I know in Flea Bottom makes a savory bowl of brown.All kinds of  meat in it, I hear.Make certain I never eat there."
2794,Bronn,Tyrion,His lordship wants  to see you.
2795,Bronn,Tyrion,"Lord Tywin.I recall who the Hand is, Pod,I lost my nose, not my wits."
2796,Bronn,Tyrion,Dont bite the boys head off now.Why not?He never uses it.
2797,Craster,Qhorin,
2798,Tyrion,Tywin,".Rubies,Garnets lack the fire."
2799,Tyrion,Tywin,My lord.You sent for me?
2800,Tyrion,Tywin,I did.Come have a look at this.
2801,Tyrion,Tywin,"A wedding gift for Joffrey,"
2802,Tyrion,Tywin,"With this fools  jabber of Stannis and his magic sword, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something  extraordinary as well.A king should bear a kingly weapon.Thats much too much sword for Joffrey,He will grow into it.Here, feel the weight of it."
2803,Tyrion,Tywin,"Valyrian steel?Yes,"
2804,Tyrion,Tywin,"The  colors are strange,"
2805,Chett,Jacelyn,"How did you get this patterning?Ive never seen anything  like it.Nor I, my lord,I confess, these colors were not what I intended, and I do not know  that I could duplicate them."
2806,Tyrion,Tywin,   Lord Tywin said. said  Tyrion.
2807,Jaime,Tyrion,Magnificent.
2808,Jaime,Tyrion,I have never felt better  balance.It is meant for my son.
2809,Robb,Tywin,"You have done good work, Master Mott,My steward will see to your  payment.And remember, rubies for the scabbards.I shall, my lord.You are most generous."
2810,Tyrion,Tywin,It is an honor to serve the Kings Hand.I shall deliver the  swords the day before the wedding.See that you do.
2811,Robert,Tyrion,"So ... a sword for Joffrey, a  sword for Jaime, and not even a dagger for the dwarf.is that the way of it, Father?The steel was sufficient for two blades, not three."
2812,Robert,Tyrion,"Gerion gave him a gilded dagger with an ivory grip and a  sapphire pommel for a wedding gift, and half the envoys who came to court tried to curry favor by  presenting His Grace with jewel-encrusted knives and silver inlay swords."
2813,Tyrion,Tywin,"Theyd have pleased him more if theyd presented him with their daughters.No doubt.The only blade he ever used was the hunting knife he had from Jon Arryn, when he was a  boy."
2814,Robert,Tywin,"What did you find at the  riverfront? Mud,"
2815,Cersei,Stannis,I shudder to think of the cost.
2816,Cersei,Stannis,You will find whatever gold is required.Will I?
2817,Petyr,Robert,. Extravagance has its uses.We must demonstrate the power and wealth of Casterly Rock for all the  realm to see.Then perhaps Casterly Rock should pay.Why?
2818,Petyr,Robert,Crown incomes are ten times higher than they were under  Aerys.As are the crowns expenses.
2819,Petyr,Tyrion,Will you forgive the thrones debt to House Lannister?Dont be absurd.Then perhaps seven courses would suffice.
2820,Petyr,Tyrion,I understand  that a marriage can be just as binding without a dancing bear.The Tyrells would think us niggardly.
2821,Petyr,Tyrion,"If you cannot pay for  them, say so, and I shall find a master of coin who can."
2822,Cersei,Tyrion,"I will  find your money.You will,and while you are about it, see if you can find your wifes bed as well."
2823,Cersei,Tyrion,"I have, thank you.Its that piece of furniture between the window and  the hearth, with the velvet canopy and the mattress stuffed with goose down.I am pleased you know of it.Now perhaps you ought to try and know the woman who shares it with  you."
2824,Cersei,Tyrion,"Has a spider been whispering in your ear, or do I have my sweet sister to  thank?"
2825,Cersei,Tyrion,"Tell me, why is it that all of Sansas maids arc women in Cerseis  service?I am sick of being spied upon in my own chambers.If you mislike your wifes servants, dismiss them and hire ones more  to your liking."
2826,Cersei,Tyrion,Is the Stark girl made differently?Why do you take so much bloody interest in where I put my cock?
2827,Cersei,Tyrion,Sansa is too  young.She is old enough to be Lady of Winterfell once her brother is dead.
2828,Tyrion,Tywin,Do I need to  remind you that a marriage that has not been consummated can be set aside?By the High Septon or a Council of Faith.
2829,Tyrion,Tywin,Moon Boy is more like to annul my marriage than he is.Perhaps I should have married Sansa Stark to Moon Boy.He might have known what to do with her.
2830,Tyrion,Tywin,I have heard all I mean to hear on the subject of my  wifes maidenhead.
2831,Craster,Qhorin,  Lord Tywin cut him off.
2832,Tyrion,Tywin,"When I first broached the match to him, Lord Tyrell seemed well enough disposed,A  day later, all was changed."
2833,Tyrion,Tywin,Varys claims she  told him that your sister was too old and too used for this precious one-legged grandson of hers.Cersei must have loved that.
2834,Tyrion,Tywin,She does not know.
2835,Tyrion,Tywin,The offer was never made.What offer?
2836,Pycelle,Tyrion,Your sister M be wed.
2837,Craster,Qhorin," Before he could get to  them, there was a rap at the door and a guardsman stuck in his head to announce Grand Maester  Pycelle."
2838,Pycelle,Tywin,"My lord Hand,there has been another bird from Castle Black."
2839,Pycelle,Tywin,Tyrion may stay.
2840,Pycelle,Tywin,The letter is from the same  Bowen Marsh who sent the last.
2841,Pycelle,Tywin,"He writes that Lord Mormont has sent word of wildlings  moving south in vast numbers.The lands beyond the Wall cannot support vast numbers,This warning is not  new.This last is, my lord."
2842,Jeor,Tyrion,"This Bowen Marsh fears Lord Mormont slain,  with all his strength."
2843,Jeor,Tyrion,Is this certain?
2844,Jeor,Tyrion,"It is not,but none of Mormonts men have returned as yet."
2845,Jeor,Pycelle,"Here is his letter, my lord, a plea to all five kings.He wants men, as many men as we can send  him.Five kings?"
2846,Jeor,Pycelle,There is one king in Westeros.
2847,Pycelle,Tyrion,"When you reply, tell him that Renly is dead and the  others are traitors and pretenders.No doubt they will be glad to learn it.The Wall is a world apart, and news oft reaches them late."
2848,Pycelle,Tyrion,What shall I tell Marsh concerning the men he begs for?
2849,Pycelle,Tyrion,There is no need.
2850,Pycelle,Tyrion,"If Mormont is indeed dead, the black  brothers must choose a new Lord Commander."
2851,Pycelle,Tyrion,"An excellent thought, my lord."
2852,Pycelle,Tyrion,Janos Slynt.
2853,Pycelle,Tyrion,"The black brothers choose their own commander,Lord Slynt is new to the Wall."
2854,Pycelle,Tyrion,"Why should they pick him over a dozen more  senior men?Because,if they do not vote as  they are told, their Wall will melt before it sees another man."
2855,Tyrion,Tywin,"Janos Slynt is the wrong man, Father."
2856,Tyrion,Tywin,Or Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.The commander of the Shadow Tower is a Mallister of Seagard.Eastwatch is held by an ironman.
2857,Tyrion,Tywin,"Janos Slynt is a butchers son,You yourself told me - "
2858,Harren,Tyrion,"There is a tool for every task, and a task for every tool."
2859,Pycelle,Tyrion,Lord Janos is a hollow suit of armor who will sell himself to the highest bidder.I count that a point in his favor.Who is like to bid higher than us?
2860,Joffrey,Pycelle,Send a raven.
2861,Pycelle,Tyrion,"In closing, ask Marsh to pass along His Graces fondest regards to his faithful  friend and servant ., Lord Janos Slynt.Yes, my lord."
2862,Pycelle,Tyrion,I shall write as the Hand commands.With great pleasure.
2863,Craster,Qhorin,
2864,Craster,Samwell,Im so cold.
2865,Craster,Samwell,That ones dead.
2866,Bedwyck,Craster,"Be kinder to  stick a knife in his chest than that spoon down his throat, you ask me.I dont recall as we did."
2867,Bedwyck,Samwell,"Slayer, did you ask Craster for his counsel?"
2868,Craster,Samwell,"Food and fire,that was all we asked of you."
2869,Craster,Samwell,"I fed you what I could, but you crows are always hungry."
2870,Craster,Samwell,"You think I need all your mouths, little man?"
2871,Craster,Samwell,Crows.
2872,Chett,Samwell,Never.
2873,Bannen,Samwell,"Im cold,"
2874,Bannen,Samwell,"Im so  cold,"
2875,Craster,Samwell,"Im cold,Please."
2876,Craster,Gilly,"Push,Harder."
2877,Craster,Samwell,Scream if it helps.
2878,Craster,Samwell,"Ive had a bellyful o that shrieking,Give her a rag to bite down on, or Ill come up there and give her a taste o my hand."
2879,Craster,Samwell,Hes killing her If he dont want the little sweetmeat he could give her to me.
2880,Gilly,Samwell,"His roof, his rule,Crasters a friend to the  Watch."
2881,Craster,Gilly,"Frozen crows,And not so big a flock as went north, neither."
2882,Gilly,Samwell,"Bloody crows,"
2883,Gilly,Samwell,"Thats it,Another push, now.Oh, I see his  head."
2884,Gilly,Samwell,"Cold,Please.Im so cold."
2885,Craster,Samwell,"Women,The way they wail ...I had me a fat sow once birthed a litter of eight  with no moren  a grunt.She was near as fat as you,  boy."
2886,Craster,Mance,A godly man got no cause to fear such.
2887,Craster,Gilly,You best  get right with the gods.
2888,Craster,Samwell,"Best that,  old man,Aye.I will."
2889,Big,Dick,"Will that do, lad?"
2890,Big,Dick,"Well enough,The crosswind helped you.It blew more strongly  when I loosed.You ought to have allowed for it, then."
2891,Big,Dick,"Have I told you about old Dick, now?Only three hundred times."
2892,Big,Samwell,"Slayer,Come, show us how you slew the  Other."
2893,Big,Samwell,"It wasnt an arrow, it was a dagger, dragonglass ."
2894,Big,Samwell,"No matter,Were all keen to see the Slayer shoot.Arent  we, lads?"
2895,Grenn,Samwell,"The  Others get your boot, Slayer?"
2896,Grenn,Samwell,It was the mud.Please dont call me that.Why not?
2897,Grenn,Samwell,"Its a good name, and you came by it fairly."
2898,Grenn,Samwell,"Its just a  different way of calling me a coward,Theyre mocking me, the same way they mock Bedwyck by calling him Giant.Hes not a giant, though,"
2899,Grenn,Samwell,"You did slay the Other, though, so its not the same.I just ..."
2900,Grenn,Samwell,I was seared!No more than me.
2901,Grenn,Samwell,I get as frightened as anyone.
2902,Grenn,Jon,"I used to be scared of Jon, whenever I had  to fight him.He was so quick, and he fought like he meant to kill me."
2903,Grenn,Jon,"I never said, though."
2904,Grenn,Jon,"Let them  call you Slayer, who cares?You never liked Ser Alliser to call you Aurochs.He was saying I was big and stupid."
2905,Grenn,Jon,"If Pyp wanted to call me Aurochs,  though, he could."
2906,Grenn,Jon,Wouldnt you rather be Samwellthe Slayer than Ser Piggy?Why cant I just be Samwell Tarly?
2907,Grenn,Samwell,"It  was the dragonglass that slew it.Not me, the dragonglass."
2908,Garth,Samwell,"I got iron, what do I want with glass?More like you  stabbed some rustling bushes and it turned out to be Small Paul taking a shit, so you came up with a lie."
2909,Grenn,Samwell,Do you think the wights are gone?
2910,Grenn,Samwell,"Why dont they come finish us?They only come when its cold.Yes,but is it the cold that brings the wights, or the wights that bring the cold?Who cares?"
2911,Grenn,Samwell,"They come together, thats what matters."
2912,Grenn,Samwell,Maybe theyre frightened of us  now!
2913,Hobb,Samwell,Snow.
2914,Dywen,Samwell,"Snow,Snow, snow"
2915,Craster,Qhorin,Who in seven hells do you think goes there?
2916,Samwell,Small,"My lord,we have only twenty-two mounts, and I doubt half will  reach the Wall.I know that,We must go all the same.Crasters made that plain."
2917,Samwell,Small,"The gods gave us a respite, but for how long?"
2918,Chett,Samwell,Tarly!Me?
2919,Chett,Samwell,Me?
2920,Chett,Samwell,Me?Is your name Tarly?
2921,Chett,Samwell,Close your mouth and come with  me.With you?
2922,Chett,Samwell,You are a man of the Nights Watch.
2923,Chett,Samwell,"Come, I said."
2924,Chett,Samwell,"Ive been thinking about this dragonglass of yours.Its not mine,Jon Snows dragonglass, then."
2925,Chett,Samwell,Every man on the Wall should be armed with one the day he says his words.We never knew...
2926,Samwell,Small,"Is dragonglass  made by dragons, as the smallfolk like to say?The m-maesters think not,The maesters say it comes from the fires of the earth.They call it obsidian."
2927,Samwell,Small,"They can call it lemon pie for all I care.If it kills as you claim, I want more of it."
2928,Samwell,Small,"Jon found more, on the Fist.  "
2929,Samwell,Small,We  need to find dragonglass someplace else.
2930,Craster,Samwell,"The children of the forest  used dragonglass blades,Theyd know where to find obsidian.The children of the forest are all dead,The First Men killed half of them with bronze  blades, and the Andals finished the job with iron."
2931,Craster,Samwell,"I have a son.Son,Son, son, son."
2932,Craster,Samwell,"Im glad for you.Are you, now?"
2933,Craster,Samwell,"Past time, Im thinking.As soon as our wounded are strong enough..."
2934,Craster,Samwell,"Or leave them, if you dont have the stomach, and  Ill sort them out myself."
2935,Craster,Samwell,"Thoren Smallwood claimed you were a friend to the Watch - Aye,I gave you all I could spare, but winters coming on, and now the girls stuck me  with another squalling mouth to feed.We could take him,"
2936,Craster,Samwell,"What did you say, Slayer?"
2937,Craster,Samwell,I ...
2938,Gilly,Samwell,  
2939,Gilly,Samwell,"You think Id give him to you crows?I only thought...Be quiet, SamwellYouve said enough."
2940,Gilly,Samwell,Inside.M-my lord -  
2941,Gilly,Samwell,How great a fool are you?
2942,Gilly,Samwell,"Even if Craster gave  us the child, hed be dead before we reached the Wall."
2943,Craster,Samwell,"Or did you mean  to take the mother too?She wants to come,She begged me...I will hear no more of this, Tarly.Youve been told and told to stay well away  from Crasters wives.Shes his daughter,Go see to Barmen."
2944,Craster,Samwell,"Before you make me wroth.Yes, my lord."
2945,Craster,Samwell,"He  said he was cold,I hope hes gone someplace warm, I do.His wound...Bugger his wound."
2946,Craster,Samwell,His foot was hurt.
2947,Craster,Samwell,"He lived to nine-and-forty.The cold,He was never warm.He was never fed,Not proper.That bastard Craster starved him dead."
2948,Bannen,Craster,"Crasters got his own to feed,All these women.Hes given us what he can.Dont you bloody believe it."
2949,Bannen,Grenn,Theres none o them  friends of the Watch.
2950,Bannen,Grenn,Ask him if you dont believe me.
2951,Garth,Samwell,"His name was Bannen,He was a brave  man, a good ranger.He came to us from ... where did he come from?Down White Harbor way,"
2952,Bannen,Samwell,"He came to us from White Harbor, and never failed in his duty."
2953,Bannen,Samwell,"We shall never see his like again.And now his watch is ended,And now his watch is ended,Ended,Ended."
2954,Bannen,Samwell,Ended
2955,Chett,Samwell,"Digging for worms, Samwell Or are  you just sick?Sick,The smell ."
2956,Chett,Samwell,. Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
2957,Chett,Samwell,I had half a mind to  carve a slice off him.
2958,Chett,Samwell,"Porks always best with  applesauce, I find."
2959,Chett,Samwell,"You best not die, Samwell or I fear I might    succumb.Theres bound to be more crackling on you than Bannen ever had, and I never could resist a  bit of crackling."
2960,Chett,Samwell,"We ride at first light, did you  hear?Sun or snow, the Old Bear tells me."
2961,Craster,Samwell,Snow?
2962,Craster,Samwell,"We ... ride?All of us?Well, no, some will need to walk."
2963,Craster,Samwell,"Dywen now, he says we need to learn to ride  dead horses, like the Others do."
2964,Craster,Samwell,How much could a dead horse eat?
2965,Craster,Samwell,Cant say I fancy the notion.
2966,Craster,Samwell,Might be Ill  die before they work it out.
2967,Craster,Samwell,"Past time,"
2968,Craster,Gilly,"My wives can roast them  horses you slaughtered, and Ill find some beer and bread."
2969,Gilly,Samwell,"Nothing better  than beer and horsemeat.If you cant ride em, eat em, thats what I say."
2970,Clubfoot,Craster,Two loaves?
2971,Clubfoot,Craster,How stupid are you women?We need  more bread than this!
2972,Clubfoot,Craster,"Take what youre given, and be thankful.Would  you sooner be out in the storm eating snow? Well be there soon enough."
2973,Clubfoot,Craster,"Id sooner eat  what Crasters hiding, my lord."
2974,Clubfoot,Craster,I gave you crows enough.I got me women to feed.
2975,Craster,Garth,Aye.
2976,Craster,Garth,"How else to make it  through a winter?Im a godly man...Youre a niggardly man,and a liar.Hams,There were pigs, last time we come."
2977,Craster,Garth,"Smoked and salted hams, and bacon too.Sausage,Them long black ones, theyre like rocks, they keep for years.I bet hes got a  hundred hanging in some cellar.Oats,Corn.Barley.Corn,Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn.Enough,Be quiet, all of you.This is  folly.Apples,Barrels and barrels of crisp autumn apples.There are apple trees  out there, I saw em.Dried berries."
2978,Craster,Garth,Pine nuts.Corn.
2979,Craster,Garth,Corn.Salt mutton.
2980,Craster,Garth,"Hes got casks and casks of mutton laid by, you know he does."
2981,Clubfoot,Craster,"Silence.Then stuff bread in your cars, old man."
2982,Clubfoot,Samwell,Or did you  swallow your bloody crumb already?
2983,Clubfoot,Samwell,Have you forgotten who I am?
2984,Clubfoot,Samwell,That is a  command.
2985,Craster,Garth,"No,Youll not sit."
2986,Garth,Samwell,And you and you and you.
2987,Garth,Samwell,"Go sleep in the cold with empty bellies, the lot o you, or...Bloody bastard!"
2988,Craster,Garth,Who calls me bastard?
2989,Craster,Samwell,"Its no more than all men know,"
2990,Craster,Garth,"The gods will curse us,There is no crime so  foul as for a guest to bring murder into a mans hall.  Remember?"
2991,Craster,Garth,"Show us where he keeps the food, or  youll get the same as he did, woman.Unhand her."
2992,Craster,Garth,"Ill have your head for this, you - "
2993,Craster,Garth,"Hold your tongue,"
2994,Craster,Grenn,Tarly.
2995,Craster,Samwell,"Tarly, go.Go.Where, my lord?"
2996,Jorah,Samwell,Theres no  place to go.The Wall.
2997,Jorah,Samwell,"Now.Now,Now NowYou must.Must tell them.Tell them what, my lord?"
2998,Jorah,Samwell,All.
2999,Jorah,Samwell,All.
3000,Jorah,Samwell,Tell my son.
3001,Jorah,Samwell,"Dying wish. Wish? The raven cocked its head, beady black eyes shining. "
3002,Jorah,Samwell,"No corn,Tell Jorah."
3003,Clubfoot,Jorah,"Go.Its too far,Ill never reach the Wall, my lord."
3004,Clubfoot,Craster,Id  sooner stay with you.
3005,Clubfoot,Craster,"Of you, or ... of anything.You should be,"
3006,Gilly,Samwell,"Were not supposed to talk to Crasters wives,We have orders.Thats done now,The blackest crows are down in the cellar, gorging,"
3007,Gilly,Jon,"The horses run off,  but Dyahs caught two.You said youd help me,I said Jon would help you."
3008,Gilly,Jon,"I couldnt leave the Lord  Commander.Child,that old crows gone before you."
3009,Jon,Samwell,Corn?No corn.He has no corn.
3010,Gilly,Samwell,"Mother have mercy.Your mother cant help you none,That dead old man cant neither."
3011,Gilly,Samwell,"And you go.The girl dont lie,Shes my girl, and I beat the lying out of her early  on."
3012,Gilly,Samwell,"Take the girl and be quick about it.Quick,Quick quick quick.Where?"
3013,Gilly,Samwell,"Where should I take her?Someplace warm,"
3014,Craster,Gilly,Me and the babe.
3015,Craster,Samwell,"If you dont take him, they will.They?They They They The boys brothers,Crasters sons."
3016,Harwin,Samwell,"Theyll be here soon, the sons."
3017,Gendry,Lem,What is this place?
3018,Gendry,Lem,"An old place, deep and secret.A refuge where neither wolves nor lions come prowling."
3019,Craster,Qhorin,"Heres the wizard, skinny squirrel."
3020,Arya,Thoros,How did you take him?
3021,Sandor,Thoros,"The dogs caught the scent.He was sleeping off a drunk under a willow tree, if you believe it.Betrayed by his own kind."
3022,Sandor,Thoros,"Welcome to our  humble hall, dog.It is not so grand as Roberts throne room, but the company is better."
3023,Sandor,Thoros,"I know you,You did.In melees, youd curse my flaming sword, though thrice I overthrew you with it.Thoros of Myr.You used to shave your head.To betoken a humble heart, but in truth my heart was vain.Besides, I lost my razor in the woods."
3024,Sandor,Thoros,"I am less than I was, but more."
3025,Sandor,Thoros,"I might look young again, and pretty maids would  shower me with kisses.Only the blind ones, priest."
3026,Sandor,Thoros,Just so.
3027,Sandor,Thoros,I have seen them in my flames.
3028,Sandor,Thoros,Bugger your flames.And you as well.
3029,Lem,Thoros,"You keep queer company for a holy man.These are my brothers,"
3030,Anguy,Sandor,"Be careful how you bark, dog.We hold your life in our hands.Best wipe the shit off your fingers, then."
3031,Anguy,Sandor,How long have you been hiding in this  hole?
3032,Anguy,Sandor,"Ask the goat if weve hidden, Hound."
3033,Anguy,Arya,Weve bloodied them all.You lot?
3034,Anguy,Arya,"You look more swineherds than soldiers.Some of us was swineherds,And some was tanners or singers  or masons.But that was before the war come.When we left Kings Landing we were men of Winterfell and men of Darry and men of Blackhaven,    Mallery men and Wylde men.We were knights and squires and men-at-arms, lords and commoners,  bound together only by our purpose."
3035,Anguy,Arya,Six score of us set out to bring the kings justice to your brother.
3036,Anguy,Arya,"Six score brave men and true, led by a fool in a starry  cloak."
3037,Arya,Sandor,"More than eighty of our company are dead now, but  others have taken up the swords that fell from their hands."
3038,Arya,Sandor,"With their help, we fight on as best we can,  for Robert and the realm.Robert?"
3039,Beric,Sandor,"Eddard Stark sent us out,but he was sitting the Iron Throne when he  gave us our commands, so we were never truly his men, but Roberts.Robert is the king of the worms now.Is that why youre down in the earth, to keep his court for him?The king is dead,but we are still kings men, though the royal banner  we bore was lost at the Mummers Ford when your brothers butchers fell upon us."
3040,Beric,Sandor,"Robert is slain, but his realm remains.And we defend her.Her?"
3041,Beric,Sandor,"Is she your mother, Dondarrion?Or your whore? "
3042,Lem,Robert,"Rocks and trees and rivers, thats what your realm is made of,Do the rocks  need defending?"
3043,Lem,Robert,"If he couldnt fuck it, fight it, or drink it, it bored him,  and so would you ... you brave companions."
3044,Lem,Sandor,"Call us that name again, dog, and youll swallow that tongue."
3045,Lem,Sandor,"Heres a brave man, baring steel on a bound captive."
3046,Lem,Sandor,Well see how brave you are then.
3047,Sandor,Thoros,"How about you?Or did you leave all your courage in your kennels?No, but I should have left you in a crow cage."
3048,Sandor,Thoros,I might still.
3049,Sandor,Thoros,"We are brothers here,Holy brothers, sworn to the realm, to our god, and to  each other.The brotherhood without banners."
3050,Sandor,Thoros,The knights of the hollow hill.Knights?
3051,Sandor,Thoros,"Dondarrions a knight, but the rest of you are the sorriest    lot of outlaws and broken men Ive ever seen.I shit better men than you.Any knight can make a knight,and every man you see  before you has felt a sword upon his shoulder. Clegane rasped. promised Thoros,  said the Mad Huntsman, "
3052,Aegon,Thoros,"No lion ever killed so cruel.I was not at Sherrer, nor the Mummers Ford,Lay your dead children at some  other door."
3053,Aegon,Thoros,Do you deny that House Clegane was built upon dead children?
3054,Aegon,Sandor,By rights your arms should bear two bloody  infants in place of those ugly dogs.
3055,Harwin,Sandor,"Do you take me for my brother?Is being born Clegane a crime?Murder is a crime.Who did I murder?Lord Lothar Mallery and Ser Gladden Wylde,My brothers Lister and Lennocks,Goodman Beck and Mudge the millers son, from Donnelwood,Merrimans widow, who loved so sweet,Them septons at Sludgy Pond.Ser Andrey Charlton."
3056,Greenbeard,Lucas,"Every man, woman, and child in Fieldstone and  Mousedown Mill.Lord and Lady Deddings, that was so rich."
3057,Lucas,Pate,"Alyn of Winterfell, Joth Quickbow, Little Matt and his sister  Randa, Anvil Ryn."
3058,Beric,Sandor,  
3059,Beric,Sandor,Youre making noise.
3060,Beric,Sandor,"Who were they?People,People great and small, young and old.Good people and bad people, who  died on the points of Lannister spears or saw their bellies opened by Lannister swords.It wasnt my sword in their bellies.Any man who says it was is a bloody liar.You serve the Lannisters of Casterly Rock,Once."
3061,Lem,Thoros,Is each of us guilty of the crimes of the others?
3062,Lem,Thoros,"Might  be you are knights after all.You lie like knights, maybe you murder like knights."
3063,Lem,Thoros,"Say what  you mean, Clegane.A knights a sword with a horse."
3064,Arya,Greenbeard,You hear me?
3065,Greenbeard,Sandor,You are a murderer!
3066,Greenbeard,Sandor,"You  killed Mycah, dont say you never did.You murdered him!"
3067,Mycah,Sandor,"And who was this Mycah, boy?Im not a boy!"
3068,Mycah,Sandor,"Jory said you cut him near  in half, and he never even had a sword."
3069,Harwin,Sandor,Whos this now?
3070,Harwin,Sandor,Seven hells.
3071,Harwin,Sandor,The brat who tossed Joffrey s pretty sword in the  river.
3072,Harwin,Sandor,"Dont you know youre dead?No, youre dead,The girl has named you a murderer."
3073,Arya,Harwin,I was Joffreys sworn shield.The butchers boy attacked a prince of the blood.Thats a lie!
3074,Harwin,Joffrey,It was me.
3075,Beric,Joffrey,"Mycah just ran away, like I told him.Did you see the boy attack Prince Joffrey?"
3076,Arya,Beric,I heard it from the royal lips.Its not my place to question princes.
3077,Arya,Thoros,"This ones own sister told the same tale when she stood before your precious Robert.Sansas just a liar,It wasnt like she said.It wasnt."
3078,Beric,Sandor,"You stand accused of murder, but no one here knows the  truth or falsehood of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you."
3079,Beric,Sandor,I sentence you to trial by battle.
3080,Arya,Sandor,Are you a fool or a madman?Neither.
3081,Arya,Harwin,"Prove your innocence with a blade, and you shall be free to go.No,"
3082,Greenbeard,Lem,So  who will it be?
3083,Greenbeard,Lem,The brave man in the piss-yellow cloak?
3084,Greenbeard,Lem,"Youve kicked dogs before, try me."
3085,Beric,Greenbeard,"Youre big enough,  Tyrosh, step forward.Or do you mean to make the little girl fight me herself?"
3086,Beric,Greenbeard,"Come  on, who wants to die?Its me youll face,"
3087,Arya,Sandor,Ill need sword and armor.
3088,Arya,Sandor,"Your sword you shall have,but your innocence must be your armor."
3089,Arya,Beric,"My innocence against your breastplate, is that the way of it?Eddard, help me remove my breastplate."
3090,Beric,Gendry,Mother have mercy.
3091,Sandor,Thoros,Does a dog have honor?
3092,Sandor,Thoros,"Lest you think to  cut your way free of here, or seize some child for a hostage ... Anguy, Dennet, Kyle, feather him at the  first sign of treachery."
3093,Beric,Thoros,First we pray.
3094,Beric,Thoros,"Lord of Light, look down upon us."
3095,Beric,Thoros,"Lord of Light,  defend us.Lord of Light, protect us in the darkness.Lord of Light, shine your face upon us.Light your flame among us, Rhllor,Show us the truth or falseness of this man."
3096,Arya,Beric,"Lord of Light, give us wisdom.For the night is dark,and full of terrors.This cave is dark too,"
3097,Arya,Beric,Youre going to meet him shortly.
3098,Arya,Gendry,"Burn in seven hells,You, and Thoros too."
3099,Lem,Thoros,"When Im done with him youll be next, Myr.Every word you say proclaims your guilt, dog,"
3100,Arya,Gendry,Is it wildfire?
3101,Arya,Gendry,No.
3102,Arya,Gendry,  magic?
3103,Arya,Sandor,Hes  yours!
3104,Arya,Sandor,At him!
3105,Arya,Beric,Bloody bastard!
3106,Arya,Gendry,"His shield is afire,"
3107,Beric,Greenbeard,Finish him!Guilty!
3108,Arya,Beric,"Guilty, guilty, kill him, guilty!"
3109,Arya,Beric,"Noooooo,"
3110,Beric,Sandor,"Please,Im burned."
3111,Arya,Sandor,Help me.
3112,Arya,Sandor,Please.
3113,Arya,Thoros,"Melly, see to his bums,Lem, Jack, help me with Lord Beric.Eddard, youd best come  too."
3114,Arya,Eddard,"I say we take him back to Stoney Sept and put him in a crow cage.Yes,He murdered Mycah.He did.Such an angry squirrel,"
3115,Greenbeard,Harwin,Rhllor has judged him innocent.Whos Rulore?
3116,Harwin,Thoros,The Lord of Light.
3117,Arya,Gendry,You want me dead that bad?
3118,Arya,Gendry,Its cleaner than fire.
3119,Arya,Lem,"You killed Mycah,Tell them."
3120,Lem,Sandor,You did.I did.
3121,Lem,Sandor,"I rode him down and cut him in half, and laughed.I watched them beat  your sister bloody too, watched them cut your fathers head off."
3122,Lem,Sandor,"You go to hell, Hound,You just go to hell!He has,"
3123,Edmure,Hoster,Walder Frey should be flayed and  quartered!
3124,Edmure,Hoster,"He sends a cripple and a bastard to treat with us, tell me there is no insult  meant by that.I have no doubt that Lord Walder chose his envoys with care,It was a peevish thing to  do, a petty sort of revenge, but remember who we are dealing with."
3125,Edmure,Robb,"The man is ill-tempered, envious, and above all prideful."
3126,Edmure,Hoster,"Now,"
3127,Edmure,Hoster,"The wind,Again."
3128,Catelyn,Edmure,"Once  more,"
3129,Brynden,Edmure,"Let me, my lord,I can do it,"
3130,Brynden,Edmure,The Others take it!
3131,Brynden,Edmure,"Swiftly,"
3132,Catelyn,Edmure,"It is no disgrace to miss your shot,Edmure should hear that.The day my  own lord father went downriver, Hoster missed as well.With his first shaft."
3133,Edmure,Hoster,His second found the sail.
3134,Catelyn,Hoster,"I should have been with him, as you were,Did he speak of me  at the end?"
3135,Catelyn,Hoster,"Did he ask for me?Tansy,He  whispered your name,"
3136,Jeyne,Robb,"Lord Hoster looked as noble as a king, my lady,Would that I had been given the  chance to know him.And I to know him better,He would have wished that too,There were too many leagues between Riverrun and  Winterfell."
3137,Lothar,Robb,Your Grace.
3138,Jeyne,Robb,"We are loath to intrude upon your grief, but perhaps you might grant  us audience tonight? It would be my pleasure,It was never my wish to sow enmity between us.Nor mine to be the cause of it,"
3139,Catelyn,Lothar,"I understand, as does my lord father.He instructed me to say that he was young  once, and well remembers what it is like to lose ones heart to beauty."
3140,Lothar,Robb,"Your father is most gracious,I shall look  forward to our talk."
3141,Catelyn,Robb,"There is something we must speak of.Will you walk with me?As you command, Your Grace.That wasnt a command, Mother.It will be my pleasure, then."
3142,Robb,Theon,"Lothar seemed amiable, thats a hopeful sign.We need the  Freys.That does not mean we shall have them."
3143,Craster,Qhorin,"Duskendale, on the narrow sea?"
3144,Galbart,Helman,"A third of my foot, lost for Duskendale?The ironmen have my castle and now the Lannisters hold my brother,"
3145,Kevan,Martyn,"Not for long,I will offer them Martyn Lannister in exchange.Lord Tywin will have  to accept, for his brothers sake."
3146,Martyn,Robb,"I should have traded the Kingslayer for Sansa when you first urged it,If Id offered to wed her to the Knight of Flowers, the Tyrells might be ours instead of Joffreys.I should have thought of that.Your mind was on your battles, and rightly so.Even a king cannot think of everything.Battles,I have won every battle, yet somehow Im  losing the war."
3147,Bran,Rickon,"The ironmen hold Winterfell,  and Moat Cailin too."
3148,Arya,Rickon,And now your father too.
3149,Arya,Robb,My father has been  dying for a long time.
3150,Catelyn,Robb,"Eddard would have been proud of you.Mother, there is something you must know."
3151,Brienne,Catelyn,Is it the Kingslayer?No.Its Sansa.
3152,Catelyn,Robb,"Is ... is she gone, Robb?Gone?"
3153,Catelyn,Robb,"Dead?Oh, Mother, no, not that, they havent harmed her, not that way,  only ... a bird came last night, but I couldnt bring myself to tell you, not until your father was sent to his  rest."
3154,Catelyn,Robb,They married her to Tyrion Lannister.
3155,Catelyn,Robb,"The Imp.Yes.He swore to trade her for his brother,Sansa and Arya both."
3156,Jaime,Robb,"How could he marry her,  after saying that in sight of gods and men?Hes the Kingslayers brother.Oathbreaking runs in their blood."
3157,Robb,Sansa,If I could Id take his ugly head off.
3158,Catelyn,Sansa,They made her speak the vows before a septon and don a crimson cloak.
3159,Catelyn,Robb,"I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door.My poor sweet Sansa ... why would  anyone do this to her?For Winterfell,With Bran and Rickon dead, Sansa is my heir."
3160,Eddard,Robb,. 
3161,Eddard,Sansa,Nothing will happen to you.
3162,Catelyn,Robb,"You are all the north has left.I am not dead yet, Mother."
3163,Catelyn,Robb,Wars need not be fought until the last drop of blood.
3164,Balon,Robert,"You would not be the first king to bend the knee, nor even the  first Stark."
3165,Balon,Robert,No.Never.There is no shame in it.
3166,Balon,Robert,Torrhen Stark  bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires.Did Aegon kill King Torrhens father?
3167,Balon,Robert,"Never, I said."
3168,Robert,Sansa,The Lannisters do not need the north.
3169,Jeyne,Robb,Do you think Lord Balon can  afford to let her live to bear you heirs?
3170,Jeyne,Robb,"Is that why you freed the Kingslayer?To make a peace with the Lannisters?I freed Jaime for Sansas sake ... and Aryas, if she still lives."
3171,Catelyn,Robb,"But if I nurtured some hope of buying peace as well, was that so ill?Yes,The Lannisters killed my father.Do you think I have forgotten that?I dont know.Have you?"
3172,Catelyn,Robb,"You are King in the North, the choice is yours."
3173,Catelyn,Robb,"To me at least, who gave it to you."
3174,Catelyn,Robb,Do I  have your leave to go?Yes.
3175,Bran,Rollam,"A dutiful squire,"
3176,Rickard,Robb,swift  sure justice
3177,Catelyn,Lothar,"Before we turn to the  business that brings us here, there is another matter,A grave matter, I fear."
3178,Catelyn,Lothar,My lord father has had a  letter from his grandsons.
3179,Brynden,Robb,The grandsons at  Winterfell? 
3180,Brynden,Robb,"My wards?Walder and WaIder, yes."
3181,Brynden,Robb,Winterfell is burned.Burned?
3182,Brynden,Robb,"Your northern lords tried to retake it from the ironmen.When Theon Greyjoy saw that his prize was  lost, he put the castle to the torch.We have heard naught of any battle,My nephews are young, I grant you, but they were there."
3183,Catelyn,Walder,"Ser Rodrik,  was that his name?Ser Rodrik Cassel,"
3184,Catelyn,Robb,"What of our other people?The ironmen put many of them to the sword, I fear."
3185,Hodor,Lothar,"Please, not all.No,The women and children hid, my nephews Walder and Walder among them.Boltons son?"
3186,Robb,Walder,"A bastard son, I believe.Not Ramsay Snow?Does Lord Roose have another bastard?"
3187,Robb,Walder,"This Ramsay was a  monster and a murderer, and he died a coward.Or so I was told.I cannot speak to that."
3188,Lothar,Robb,"They are safe at the Dreadfort now, all those who remain.Theon,What happened to Theon Greyjoy?Was he slain?"
3189,Lothar,Walder,"That I cannot say, Your Grace."
3190,Brynden,Walder,"Perhaps Lord Bolton might know, if he has had word from this son of his.We will be certain to ask him.You are all distraught, I see."
3191,Edmure,Lothar,"   said Robb, "
3192,Edmure,Lothar,"Me as well.Do you have an answer to our offer, my lord?I do."
3193,Edmure,Lothar,"My lord father bids me tell Your Grace that he will agree to this new marriage  alliance between our houses and renew his fealty to the King in the North, upon the condition that the  Kings Grace apologize for the insult done to House Frey, in his royal person, face to face."
3194,Robb,Walder,"I am pleased,It was never my wish to cause this rift between us, Lothar."
3195,Robb,Walder,"I would have them at my side once more.You are too kind, Your Grace."
3196,Beth,Edmure,She has a gentle nature and a gift for music.
3197,Edmure,Walder,Might not it be better if I first met -   said Walder Rivers curtly.
3198,Edmure,Walder,"I will take your word so far as her teeth are concerned, but it would be  pleasant if I might gaze upon her face before I espoused her.You must accept her now, my lord,Else my fathers offer is withdrawn."
3199,Edmure,Lothar,"My brother has a soldiers bluntness, but what he says is true.It is my  lord fathers wish that this marriage take place at once.At once?"
3200,Brynden,Lothar,Has Lord Walder forgotten that we are fighting a war?
3201,Brynden,Lothar,"Scarcely,That is why he insists that the marriage take place now, ser."
3202,Catelyn,Walder,"It would put his noble heart at peace if he could see his dear Roslin safely  wed before the gods take him, so he might die with the knowledge that the girl had a strong husband to  cherish and protect her."
3203,Lothar,Walder,"My brother has just lost his own father.He needs time to  mourn.Roslin is a cheerful girl,She may be the very thing Lord Edmure needs to help him  through his grief.And my grandfather has come to mislike lengthy betrothals,I  cannot imagine why."
3204,Lothar,Robb,"I take your meaning, Rivers.Pray excuse us.As Your Grace commands."
3205,Edmure,Walder,Theyre as much as saying that my promise is worthless.
3206,Catelyn,Roslin,"Im his liege lord, he should be overjoyed that Im willing  to wed any of them.He is a proud man, and weve wounded him,The Others take his pride!"
3207,Catelyn,Robb,My answer is no.
3208,Edmure,Robb,I will not command you.
3209,Edmure,Robb,"But if you refuse, Lord Frey will  take it for another slight, and any hope of putting this arights will be gone.You cannot know that,Frey has wanted me for one of his daughters since the day I  was bom."
3210,Brynden,Robb,"When Lothar brings  him our answer, hell come wheedling back and accept a betrothal ... and to a daughter of my choosing.Perhaps, in time,But can we wait, while Lothar rides back and forth with  offers and counters?"
3211,Brynden,Robb,I must get back to the north.
3212,Catelyn,Theon,"I cant sit here waiting for a wedding that might or might not happen.It must happen,I have no more wish to suffer Walder Freys insults  and complaints than you do, Brother, but I see little choice here."
3213,Catelyn,Robb,"Edmure, we must accept.We must accept?"
3214,Robb,Walder,"I dont see you offering to become the ninth Lady Frey, Cat.The eighth Lady Frey is still alive and well, so far as I know,"
3215,Craster,Qhorin,"I am the last man in the Seven Kingdoms to tell  anyone who they must wed, Nephew."
3216,Brynden,Edmure,Swimming the sunset sea with my legs tied.
3217,Alester,Edmure,The Others take you all!
3218,Alester,Edmure,As amends.
3219,Alester,Davos,"Voices,Do you hear, Davos?Someone is coming for us.Lamprey,Its time for our supper, or near enough."
3220,Alester,Davos,"No, theres more than one."
3221,Alester,Lamprey,"The king has sent for me.Or the queen, yes, Selyse  would never let me rot here, her own blood."
3222,Alester,Lamprey,"Axell,Gods be good.Is it the king who sends for me, or the queen?No one has sent for you, traitor,"
3223,Alester,Axell,"No, I swear to you, I committed no treason."
3224,Craster,Qhorin,
3225,Axell,Davos,"You,Come.Where?"
3226,Axell,Davos,"Tell me true, ser, do you mean to bum me?You are sent for.Can you walk?I can walk."
3227,Axell,Lamprey,"Take the torch,Leave the traitor to the darkness.No,Axell, please, dont take the light gods have mercy ."
3228,Axell,Lamprey,". Gods?There is only Rhllor, and the Other."
3229,Axell,Davos,Are you taking me to Melisandre?
3230,Axell,Davos,"She will be there,She is never far from the king.But it is His Grace himself who asked  for you."
3231,Axell,Melisandre,"Were it my choice, I would bum you with my brother  Alester,  he told Davos.You are both traitors.Say what you will.I would never betray King Stannis.You would."
3232,Axell,Davos,And you will tell him so.
3233,Axell,Davos,"The queen has urged my appointment,Even your old friend from Lys, the pirate  Saan, he says the same."
3234,Axell,Davos,"Tell him, and when we sail I shall see that you have a new ship."
3235,Axell,Davos,"if you think to betray me,"
3236,Axell,Davos,"Perhaps I cannot burn you without the kings consent, but who is to  say you might not suffer a fall."
3237,Axell,Davos,"Do you hear me?I hear,"
3238,Axell,Davos,Good.
3239,Axell,Davos,His Grace awaits.Best we do not keep him.
3240,Davos,Stannis,"Your Grace,as it please you, I have brought the onion knight.So I see."
3241,Davos,Stannis,"So the sea has returned me my knight of the fish  and onions.It did, Your Grace."
3242,Davos,Stannis,"Rise, Ser Davos,I have missed you, ser."
3243,Davos,Stannis,So tell me true - what is the penalty for treason?
3244,Aegon,Davos,Treason?
3245,Aegon,Davos,"What else would you call it, to deny your king and seek to steal his rightful throne.I ask you again -  what is the penalty for treason under the law?"
3246,Aegon,Davos,"Death,The penalty is death, Your Grace.It has always been so."
3247,Davos,Hareth,"Not cruelty.Yes, Your Grace."
3248,Davos,Shireen,"Sire,  Lord Florent meant no treason.Do smugglers have another name for it?"
3249,Davos,Shireen,"Mine only child, he would have wed to a  bastard bom of incest."
3250,Davos,Shireen,My brother had a gift for inspiring loyalty.
3251,Davos,Stannis,"   said Ser Axell,  King Stannis told Davos."
3252,Axell,Joffrey,"They  waste their days drinking and gambling, and lick their wounds like beaten curs.Battle will set their hearts ablaze once more, Your Grace,Defeat is a disease, and  victory is the cure.Victory."
3253,Axell,Davos,"There are victories and victories, ser."
3254,Axell,Davos,I would hear his views on what you propose.
3255,Axell,Joffrey,"Too frightened of His Graces wrath to come near Dragonstone, no doubt,And wisely so.The man has betrayed his rightful king."
3256,Axell,Stannis,"Put his castle to the torch and his people to the sword, I say,Leave Claw Isle a desolation of ash and bone, fit only for carrion crows, so the realm  might see the fate of those who bed with Lannisters."
3257,Craster,Qhorin,
3258,Davos,Salladhor,"By itself Claw Isle is worthless, but its fall would serve notice to Lord Tywin that my  cause is not yet done."
3259,Davos,Salladhor,"Speak truly, ser.What do you make of Ser  Axells proposal?"
3260,Axell,Stannis,"Your Grace,I  make it folly ... aye, and cowardice.Cowardice?"
3261,Axell,Stannis,"No man calls me craven before my king!Silence,Ser Davos, speak on, I would hear your reasons."
3262,Axell,Davos,You say we ought show the realm we are not done.
3263,Axell,Davos,"You will find no Lannisters on Claw Isle.We will find traitors,though it may be I could find some closer to home."
3264,Davos,Stannis,"I dont doubt Lord Celtigar bent the knee to the boy Joffrey.He is an old done  man, who wants no more than to end his days in his castle, drinking his fine wine out of his jeweled cups."
3265,Davos,Stannis,"Yet he came when you called, sire."
3266,Axell,Davos,". They are,Not all of Celtigars men were slain on the Blackwater.Hundreds were  taken with their lord, and bent the knee when he did.When he did,They were his men."
3267,Axell,Davos,What choice were they given?Every man has choices.
3268,Davos,Stannis,"Yet they died true  men, and loyal.Some men are stronger than others."
3269,Davos,Stannis,"It is every mans duty to remain loyal to his rightful king, even if the lord he serves proves false,"
3270,Axell,Davos,As you remained loyal to King  Aerys when your brother raised his banners?
3271,Axell,Davos,Treason!
3272,Davos,Stannis,"Your Grace, he speaks his infamy to your face!"
3273,Axell,Stannis,"Put up your knife, Ser Axell.And leave us.As it please Your Grace -   said Stannis."
3274,Davos,Stannis,"You have always presumed on my forbearance,I can  shorten your tongue as easy as I did your fingers, smuggler.I am your man, Your Grace.So it is your tongue, to do with as you please. he said, calmer."
3275,Aerys,Davos,My brother or my king.
3276,Aerys,Davos,Have you ever seen the Iron Throne?
3277,Davos,Robert,"Ofttimes I  wonder why my brothers wanted it so desperately.Why would you want it, then?"
3278,Davos,Robert,It is not a question of wanting.
3279,Davos,Robert,"After me, it must pass  to my daughter, unless Selyse should finally give me a son."
3280,Davos,Robert,I am king.
3281,Davos,Jon,"I was still at Storms End, under siege and unconsulted."
3282,Davos,Jon,"The truth, now.Why did you wish to murder  Lady Melisandre?"
3283,Davos,Jon,Four of my sons burned on the Blackwater.She gave  them to the flames.You wrong her.
3284,Devan,Melisandre,"She remains my faithful servant.Maester Cressen was your faithful servant.She slew him, as she killed Ser Cortnay Penrose and your  brother Renly.Now you sound a fool,She saw Renlys end in the flames, yes, but she had no  more part in it than I did."
3285,Davos,Melisandre,And it was Melisandre who told me to send for you  when Ser Axell wished to give you to Rhllor.
3286,Davos,Devan,Does that surprise you?Yes.She knows I am no friend to her or her red god.But you are a friend to me.She knows that as well.
3287,Davos,Devan,The boy is sick.Maester Pylos has been leeching him.The boy?
3288,Devan,Edric,"My son, sire? Devan?"
3289,Edric,Stannis,"It is Roberts bastard who is sick, the boy we took at  Storms End."
3290,Edric,Stannis,I spoke with him in Aegons Garden.As she wished.As she saw.
3291,Edric,Stannis,Did the boy charm you?
3292,Renly,Robert,Penrose chose to die rather  than give him up.
3293,Davos,Robert,It still angers me.
3294,Davos,Robert,I chose blood over honor.
3295,Davos,Stannis,hope young Edric will recover soon.
3296,Pylos,Stannis,"It is a chill, no more."
3297,Davos,Stannis,"There is power in a kings blood, she says."
3298,Aegon,Stannis,"Look at it, onion knight."
3299,Aegon,Stannis,My Westeros.
3300,Aegon,Stannis,This talk of Seven Kingdoms is a folly.
3301,Axell,Davos,"One realm, for one king to rule alone.One kin&One king means peace.I shall bring justice to Westeros."
3302,Davos,Stannis,"They have made my kingdom bleed, and I do not forget that."
3303,Davos,Stannis,"On  your knees, Onion Knight.Your Grace?For your onions and fish, I made you a knight once.For this, I am of a mind to raise you to lord."
3304,Davos,Stannis,"I am content to be your knight, Your Grace.I would not know how to begin  being lordly.Good."
3305,Davos,Stannis,Your king commands.
3306,Davos,Stannis,"Ser Davos of House    Seaworth,"
3307,Davos,Stannis,"Your Grace, you  cannot ...I am no fit man to be a Kings Hand.There is no man fitter."
3308,Davos,Stannis,"I am lowbom,An upjumped smuggler.Your lords will never obey me.Then we will make new lords.But ..."
3309,Davos,Stannis,Maester Pylos can read for you.
3310,Davos,Stannis,Service.Surely there is someone better ... some great lord.
3311,Andrew,Stannis,"Bar Emmon, that boy?"
3312,Andrew,Stannis,"Celtigar has abandoned me, the new  Velaryon is six years old, and the new Sunglass sailed for Volantis after I burned his brother."
3313,Andrew,Stannis,"A few good men remain, its true."
3314,Alester,Davos,It is you I  want beside me for the battle.
3315,Alester,Davos,"Your Grace asked for honest counsel.In honesty then ... we lack the strength for another battle against  the Lannisters.It is the great battle His Grace is speaking of,"
3316,Davos,Melisandre,These little wars are no more than a scuffle of children before what is to come.
3317,Davos,Stannis,"Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends."
3318,Davos,Stannis,Unless true men find the courage to fight it.Men whose hearts are fire.
3319,Melisandre,Stannis,"She has shown it to me, Lord Davos.In the flames.You saw it, sire?"
3320,Melisandre,Stannis,With mine own eyes.
3321,Davos,Melisandre,"But what I saw was real, Id stake my kingdom on it.And have,"
3322,Davos,Melisandre,A hill in a forest ... shapes in the snow  ...   said Melisandre.
3323,Melisandre,Renly,"Westeros must  unite beneath her one true king, the prince that was promised, Lord of Dragonstone and chosen of  Rhllor.Rhllor chooses queerly, then."
3324,Melisandre,Renly,"Why me, and not  my brothers?"
3325,Craster,Qhorin, His teeth ground side to side.
3326,Melisandre,Robert,"Why me?Because you are a righteous man,A righteous man."
3327,Melisandre,Stannis,"With leeches.Yes,but I must tell you once more, this is not the way.You swore it would work."
3328,Melisandre,Stannis,"It will ... and it will not.Which?Both.Speak sense to me, woman.When the fires speak more plainly, so shall .There is truth in the flames, but it is not always easy to  see."
3329,Melisandre,Stannis,"Give me the boy, Your Grace."
3330,Melisandre,Stannis,"Give me the boy and I shall wake the stone dragon.I have told you, no.He is only one baseborn boy, against all the boys of Westeros, and all the girls as well.Against all the    children that might ever be born, in all the kingdoms of the world.The boy is innocent.The boy defiled your marriage bed, else you would surely have sons of your own.He shamed you.Robert did that."
3331,Melisandre,Stannis,"And he is mine own blood.Your brothers blood,A kings blood.Only a kings blood can wake the stone  dragon."
3332,Melisandre,Stannis,Ill hear no more of this.
3333,Melisandre,Patchface,Do your work.As my king commands.
3334,Melisandre,Stannis,"Say the name,"
3335,Melisandre,Stannis,"The usurper,Joffrey Baratheon."
3336,Melisandre,Stannis,"The usurper,Balon Greyjoy."
3337,Harren,Stannis,"The  usurper,Robb Stark."
3338,Brienne,Jaime,"Not so hard, wench,Youll scrub the skin off."
3339,Gregor,Jaime,What are you doing here?
3340,Gregor,Jaime,"Lord Bolton insists I sup with him, but he neglected to invite my fleas."
3341,Gregor,Jaime,Help me out of these stinking rags.
3342,Brienne,Jaime,"Now leave us,My lady of Tarth doesnt want the likes of you scum gaping at her teats."
3343,Brienne,Jaime,You too.
3344,Brienne,Jaime,"Theres  only the one door, and the wench is too big to try and shinny up a chimney."
3345,Brienne,Harren,There are other tubs.This one suits me well enough.
3346,Brienne,Qyburn,"Have no fear, wench.Your thighs are purple and green, and Im not interested in what youve got  between them."
3347,Brienne,Qyburn,"if I faint, pull me out.No Lannister  has ever drowned in his bath and I dont mean to be the first.Why should I care how you die?You swore a solemn vow."
3348,Jaime,Qyburn,Still the shy maiden?What is it that you think I havent seen?
3349,Cersei,Jaime,Does the sight of my stump distress you so?
3350,Cersei,Jaime,You ought to be pleased.
3351,Cersei,Jaime,The hand Id slide between my  sisters thighs to make her wet.
3352,Cersei,Jaime,"No wonder Renly died, with you  guarding him."
3353,Cersei,Jaime,"That was unworthy,Im a maimed man, and bitter."
3354,Cersei,Jaime,"You protected me as well as any man  could have, and better than most."
3355,Cersei,Jaime,Do you mock me?
3356,Cersei,Jaime,Are you as thick as a castle wall?
3357,Jaime,Robert,Truces are built on trust.    The oathbreaker who murdered poor sad Aerys Targaryen. 
3358,Jaime,Robert,"Its  not Aerys I rue, its Robert."
3359,Brienne,Robert,"He tore the realm apart, yet I am the one with shit for honor.Robert did all he did for love."
3360,Brienne,Robert,"Robert did all he did for pride, a cunt, and a pretty face."
3361,Aerys,Jaime,"He rode to save the realm,"
3362,Aerys,Jaime,Did you know that my brother set the Blackwater Rush afire?
3363,Aerys,Jaime,The Targaryens were all mad for fire.
3364,Jaime,Lewyn,Soiled my white cloak ...  
3365,Elia,Lewyn,"After dancing griffins lost the Battle of the Bells, Aerys exiled him."
3366,Elia,Lewyn,"He had finally realized that Robert was no mere outlaw lord to be  crushed at whim, but the greatest threat House Targaryen had faced since Daemon Blackfyre."
3367,Aerys,Baelor,Everything was done in the utmost secrecy by a handful of master pyromancers.
3368,Aerys,Rickard,"Chelsted, that was his name,  Lord Chelsted."
3369,Aerys,Rickard,"Id thought the man craven, but the  day he confronted Aerys he found some courage somewhere."
3370,Rickard,Varys,"My Sworn Brothers were all away, you see, but Aerys liked to keep  me close."
3371,Aerys,Varys,So I heard it all.
3372,Aerys,Viserys,"Rhaegar met  Robert on the Trident, and you know what happened there."
3373,Aerys,Pycelle,"Eddard Stark was racing south with Roberts van, but my fathers forces reached the city first."
3374,Aerys,Varys,"It fell to me to hold the Red Keep, but I knew we were lost."
3375,Aerys,Jaime,"When I came on Rossart, he was dressed as a common man-at-arms, hurrying to a postern gate."
3376,Aerys,Jaime,"Well, a swords more merciful than fire, but I dont think Garigus much appreciated the kindness I  showed him."
3377,Brienne,Jaime,Has my tale turned you speechless?
3378,Brienne,Jaime,"Something.If this is true, how is it no one knows?The knights of the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the kings secrets.Would you have me break my  oath?"
3379,Brienne,Jaime,Do you think the noble Lord of Winterfell wanted to hear my feeble explanations?
3380,Brienne,Jaime,He only had to look at me to judge me guilty.
3381,Brienne,Jaime,By what right does the wolf judge the lion?By what right?
3382,Cersei,Jaime,Guards!
3383,Cersei,Jaime,The Kingslayer!
3384,Brienne,Qyburn,"The heat of the tubs will do it,"
3385,Jaime,Qyburn,"Theres still poison in his blood as well, and hes malnourished.What have you been  feeding him?Worms and piss and grey vomit,Hardbread and water and oat porridge,He dont hardly eat it, though.What should  we do with him?Scrub him and dress him and carry him to Kingspyre, if need be,Lord Bolton insists he  will sup with him tonight.The time is growing short.Bring me clean garb for him,Ill see that hes washed and dressed."
3386,Brienne,Jaime,Now all I need is a silver looking glass.
3387,Brienne,Jaime,"I am sorry, my lady.These were the only womens garments in Harrenhal large enough to fit  YOU."
3388,Jaime,Qyburn,What is it?
3389,Brienne,Jaime,"Licorice steeped in vinegar, with honey and cloves.It will give you some strength and clear your head.Bring me the potion that grows new hands,Thats the one I want.Drink it,"
3390,Jaime,Qyburn,"Mlord will be looking for him by now,Her too.Do I need to carry him?I can still walk.Brienne, give me your arm."
3391,Brienne,Roose,"My lord,"
3392,Brienne,Roose,"I am  pleased that you are strong enough to attend me, ser.My lady, do be seated."
3393,Brienne,Jaime,Will you drink red or white?
3394,Brienne,Jaime,Ser Amory drained Lady Whents cellars nearly dry.I trust you killed him for it.
3395,Brienne,Jaime,"White is for Starks.Ill drink red like a good Lannister.I would prefer water,Elmar, the red for Ser Jaime, water for the Lady Brienne, and hippocras for myself."
3396,Jaime,Roose,"Do try these, Ser Jaime."
3397,Jaime,Roose,"Lord Vargo took them from an inn before he burnt it.My bowels move fine, that goats no lord, and your prunes dont interest me half so much as your  intentions.Regarding you?"
3398,Jaime,Roose,"You are a perilous prize, ser."
3399,Jaime,Roose,"Even here, in my happy house of Harrenhal."
3400,Jaime,Roose,"And in Riverrun as well, it seems.Do you know, Edmure Tully has offered a thousand  golden dragons for your recapture?"
3401,Jaime,Roose,My sister will pay ten times as much.Will she?
3402,Jaime,Roose,Ten thousand dragons is a formidable  sum.
3403,Jaime,Roose,"He promises the hand of his daughter  to the man who brings him your head.Leave it to your goat to get it backward,"
3404,Jaime,Roose,"Harrion Karstark was captive here when we took the castle, did you  know?"
3405,Brienne,Jaime,I do hope nothing ill  befell him at Duskendale ... else Alys Karstark would be all that remains of Lord Rickards progeny.
3406,Brienne,Jaime,"Fortunately for you, I have no need of a wife.I wed the Lady Walda Frey whilst I  was at the Twins.Fair Walda? "
3407,Brienne,Jaime,Fat Walda.
3408,Brienne,Jaime,"Elmar, break off some bread for Ser Jaime."
3409,Brienne,Jaime,"Lord Bolton,its said you mean to give Harrenhal to Vargo Hoat.That was his price,The Lannisters are not the only men who pay their debts."
3410,Brienne,Jaime,"Edmure Tully is to wed the Lady Roslin Frey at the Twins, and my king  commands my attendance.Edmure weds?"
3411,Jaime,Jeyne,Not Robb Stark?His Grace King Robb is wed.To a Westerling of  the Crag.
3412,Jaime,Jeyne,"Her father is your fathers  bannerman.My father has a good many bannermen, and most of them have daughters."
3413,Brienne,Jeyne,"This cannot be true,King Robb was sworn to wed a Frey.   said Roose Bolton mildly."
3414,Brienne,Robb,How does Lord Walder relish dining on trout in place of wolf?
3415,Brienne,Robb,"Oh, trout makes for a tasty supper."
3416,Brienne,Roose,"Though my poor  Elmar is bereft.He was to wed Arya Stark, but my good father of Frey had no choice but to break the  betrothal when King Robb betrayed him.Is there word of Arya Stark?"
3417,Brienne,Roose,"Lady Catelyn had feared that ... is the girl still  alive?Oh, yes,You have certain knowledge of that, my lord?"
3418,Brienne,Roose,"Arya Stark was lost for a time, it was true, but now she has been found.I  mean to see her returned safely to the north.Her and her sister both,Tyrion Lannister has promised us both girls for his brother."
3419,Brienne,Jaime,"My lady, has no one told you?Lannisters lie.Is that a slight on the honor of my House?"
3420,Brienne,Jaime,"A  rounded point, and dull,but it will go through  your eye all the same."
3421,Jaime,Roose,"You speak boldly for a man who needs help to  break his bread.My guards are all around us, I remind you.All around us, and half a league away."
3422,Jaime,Roose,"By the time they  reach us, youll be as dead as Aerys.Tis scarcely chivalrous to threaten your host over his own cheese and olives,In the north, we hold the laws of hospitality sacred still.Im a captive here, not a guest."
3423,Jaime,Roose,"if you think some prunes will make me  overlook that, youre bloody well mistaken."
3424,Jaime,Roose,"Perhaps I am.Perhaps I ought to make a wedding gift of you to  Edmure Tully ... or strike your head off, as your sister did for Eddard Stark.I would not advise it.Casterly Rock has a long memory.A thousand leagues of mountain, sea, and bog lie between my walls and your rock.Lannister enmity  means little to Bolton.Lannister friendship could mean much."
3425,Brienne,Roose,I am not certain you are the sort of friends a wise man would want.
3426,Brienne,Roose,"Elmar, carve our guests a slice off the roast."
3427,Brienne,Jaime,"My lord,Ser Jaime is to be exchanged  for Lady Catelyns daughters."
3428,Catelyn,Jaime,I serve Lady Stark.And I the King in the North.
3429,Elmar,Jaime,"Who never  wished to trade Ser Jaime back to the Lannisters.Sit down and eat, Brienne,If Bolton meant to kill us, he wouldnt be wasting his precious prunes on us, at such peril to his bowels."
3430,Roose,Vargo,"Lady Brienne, will you sit if  I tell you that I hope to send Ser Jaime on, just as you and Lady Stark desire?I ... youd send us on?"
3431,Jaime,Vargo,"That is good, my lord.It is."
3432,Jaime,Vargo,difficulty.
3433,Jaime,Vargo,Do you know why Hoat cut off your hand?He enjoys cutting off hands.
3434,Jaime,Vargo,"He enjoys cutting off feet as well.He doesnt seem to need a reason.Nonetheless, he had one."
3435,Elmar,Jaime,No man commands a company such  as the Brave Companions for long unless he has some wits about him.
3436,Elmar,Jaime,"Lord Vargo abandoned  House Lannister because I offered him Harrenhal, a reward a thousand times greater than any he could  hope to have from Lord Tywin.As a stranger to Westeros, he did not know the prize was poisoned.The curse of Harren the Black?"
3437,Elmar,Jaime,The curse of Tywin Lannister.
3438,Elmar,Jaime,"Our goat should  have consulted the Tarbecks or the Reynes.They might have warned him how your lord father deals with  betrayal.There are no Tarbecks or Reynes,My point precisely.Lord Vargo doubtless hoped that Lord Starmis would triumph at Kings Landing,  and thence confirm him in his possession of this castle in gratitude for his small part in the downfall of  House Lannister."
3439,Brienne,Jaime,"He knows little of Starmis Baratheon either, I fear.That one  might have given him Harrenhal for his service ... but he would have given him a noose for his crimes as  well.A noose is kinder than what hell get from my father.By now he has come to the same realization.With Stannis broken and Renly dead, only a Stark victory  can save him from Lord Tywins vengeance, but the chances of that grow perishingly slim.King Robb has won every battle,Won every battle, while losing the Freys, the Karstarks, Winterfell, and the north."
3440,Alys,Robb,Not for the likes of Vargo Hoat.
3441,Alys,Robb,"Both sides have made  use of him, but neither will shed a tear at his passing.The Brave Companions did not fight in the Battle of  the Blackwater, yet they died there all the same.Youll forgive me if I dont mourn?You have no pity for our wretched doomed goat?Ah, but the gods must ... else why deliver you into  his hands?"
3442,Alys,Robb,"Karhold is smaller and meaner than Harrenhal, but it  lies well beyond the reach of the lions claws."
3443,Rickard,Tywin,"But to sell you he must keep you, and the riverlands are full of those who would gladly steal you away."
3444,Edmure,Robb,Dondarrion would gladly hang you and the goat together    from the same tree.
3445,Edmure,Robb,"Harrenhal was the only place Lord Vargo could hope to hold you safe, but here his Brave Companions  are much outnumbered by my own men, and by Ser Aenys and his Freys."
3446,Edmure,Robb,"By maiming you, he meant to remove your sword as a threat, gain himself a grisly token to send to your  father, and diminish your value to me."
3447,Jaime,Robb,And therein lies my ... small difficulty.
3448,Jaime,Robb,You want me to absolve you of blame.To tell my father that this stump is no work of yours.
3449,Jaime,Robb,"My lord, send me to Cersei, and Ill sing as sweet a song as you could want, of how  gently you treated me."
3450,Brienne,Jaime,"Had I  a hand, Id write it out.How I was maimed by the sellsword my own father brought to Westeros, and  saved by the noble Lord Bolton.I will trust to your word, ser."
3451,Brienne,Jaime,"How soon might we be permitted to leave?And how do you  mean to get me past all these wolves and brigands and Karstarks?You will leave when Qyburn says you are strong enough, with a strong escort of picked men under the  command of my captain, Walton."
3452,Brienne,Jaime,"Walton will see you  safe and whole to Kings Landing.Provided Lady Catelyns daughters are delivered safe and whole as well,My lord,  your man Waltons protection is welcome, but the girls are my charge."
3453,Brienne,Jaime,"The girls need not concern you any further,  my lady.The Lady Sansa is the dwarfs wife, only the gods can part them now.His wife?"
3454,Brienne,Jaime,The Imp?
3455,Brienne,Jaime,. 
3456,Roose,Tyrion,"What the Imp did or did nor swear scarcely matters now,Least of all to you."
3457,Roose,Tyrion,Ser Jaime will continue on to Kings Landing.
3458,Roose,Tyrion,it would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo of both his prizes.
3459,Roose,Tyrion,"Were I you, my lady, I should worry less about  Starks and rather more about sapphires."
3460,Bronn,Tyrion,How many banners do you count?
3461,Bronn,Tyrion,"Eight ... no, nine."
3462,Podrick,Tyrion,"Pod, come up here.Describe the arms you see, and tell me which houses  they represent."
3463,Bronn,Tyrion,"I cant see.The wind is flapping them.Bronn, tell the boy what you see."
3464,Podrick,Tyrion,"A red sun on orange,with a spear through its back.Martell,House Martell of Sunspear, my lord.The Prince  of Dome.My horse would have known that one,Give him another, Bronn.Theres a purple flag with yellow balls.Lemons?"
3465,Bronn,Tyrion,A purple fleld strewn with lemons?
3466,Bronn,Tyrion,"Of, of  Lemonwood.Might be."
3467,Bronn,Tyrion,"Something pink or white in its claws, hard to say with the  banner flapping.The vulture of Blackmont grasps a baby in its talons,House Blackmont of Blackmont, ser."
3468,Bronn,Tyrion,Reading books again?
3469,Bronn,Tyrion,"A black  banner.The crowned skull of House Manwoody, bone and gold on black."
3470,Bronn,Tyrion,"The Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.Three black spiders?Theyre scorpions, ser.House Qorgyle of Sandstone, three scorpions black on red.Red and yellow, a jagged line between.The flames of Hellholt.House Uller."
3471,Bronn,Tyrion,"Go on, Pod,If you get them all, Ill make you a gift.A pie with red and black slices,Theres a gold hand in the middle.House Allyrion of Godsgrace.A red chicken eating a snake, looks like.The Gargalens of Salt Shore."
3472,Bronn,Tyrion,"Red, with a black snake in its  beak.Very good!"
3473,Bronn,Tyrion,"One more, lad."
3474,Bronn,Tyrion,"The lasts a golden feather on green checks.A golden quill, ser.Jordayne of the Tor."
3475,Bronn,Tyrion,"Nine, and well done.I could not have named them all myself."
3476,Myrcella,Tyrion,"My lord,theres no litter."
3477,Doran,Tyrion,"Doran Martell always travels in a litter,A carved litter with silk hangings, and suns on the  drapes."
3478,Bronn,Doran,"Banners forward,Well meet them."
3479,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Well met, my lords."
3480,Joffrey,Tyrion,My lord father the  Kings Hand sends his greetings as well.
3481,Joffrey,Tyrion,Which of you is Prince  Doran?My brothers health requires he remain at Sunspear.
3482,Lem,Tyrion,"Prince Doran has sent me to join King  Joffreys council in his stead, as it please His Grace.His Grace will be most honored to have the counsel of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn of    Dome,And your noble companions are most  welcome as well.Permit me to acquaint you with them, my lord of Lannister."
3483,Arron,Tyrion,"Lady Larra Blackmont, her daughter Jynessa, her son Perros."
3484,Cersei,Tyrion,"And this is  Ellaria Sand, mine own paramour."
3485,Bronn,Tyrion,"Ellaria, lords and ladies, sers,  see how well King Joffrey loves us.His Grace has been so kind as to send his own Uncle Imp to bring us  to his court. "
3486,Bronn,Tyrion,"Not alone, my lords.That would be too enormous a task for a little man like me."
3487,Addam,Gyles,"Let me present Ser Flement Brax, heir to Homvale."
3488,Stannis,Tyrion,"And mine own squire, young Podrick of House Payne."
3489,Oberyn,Tyrion,"My lord of Lannister,we have come a long dusty way, and rest and  refreshment would be most welcome."
3490,Oberyn,Tyrion,"We have met before,I would not expect you to remember, though.You were even smaller than you are now."
3491,Elia,Tyrion,"When was this, my lord?"
3492,Elia,Tyrion,"Oh, many and many a year ago, when my mother ruled in Dome and your lord father was Hand to a  different king."
3493,Elia,Tyrion,"It was when I visited Casterly Rock with my mother, her consort, and my sister Elia."
3494,Elia,Tyrion,"Your brother and sister were eight or nine, as I recall,  and you had just been bom."
3495,Tytos,Tywin,"He was not the same man after she died, imp,The best part of  him died with her."
3496,Kevan,Tyrion,"Did  you find Casterly Rock to your liking, my lord?Scarcely."
3497,Elia,Tyrion,"Your skies were too grey, your wines too sweet, your women too  chaste, your food too bland ... and you yourself were the greatest disappointment of all.I had just been born.What did you expect of me?Enormity,You were small, but far-famed.We were in Oldtown at  your birth, and all the city talked of was the monster that had been born to the Kings Hand, and what  such an omen might foretell for the realm.Famine, plague, and war, no doubt."
3498,Tyrion,Tywin,"Its always famine, plague, and war.Oh, and winter, and the long night that never ends.All that,"
3499,Aerys,Tyrion,"You  were his curse, a punishment sent by the gods to teach him that he was no better than any other man.I try, but he refuses to learn."
3500,Aerys,Tyrion,"But do go on, I pray you.I love a good tale.And well you might, since you were said to have one, a stiff curly tail like a swines."
3501,Bronn,Oberyn,"Your teeth were so long you could not close your  mouth, and between your legs were a girls privates as well as a boys.Life would be much simpler if men could fuck themselves, dont you agree?"
3502,Bronn,Oberyn,"Even so, I begin to see the nature of your  complaint."
3503,Bronn,Oberyn,We might never have seen you at all but for  your sweet sister.
3504,Oberyn,Tyrion,"You would wail for hours, and nothing would quiet you but a womans teat.Still true, as it happens."
3505,Oberyn,Tyrion,"A taste we share.Lord Gargalen once told me he hoped to die with  a sword in his hand, to which I replied that I would sooner go with a breast in mine."
3506,Oberyn,Tyrion,You were speaking of my sister?Cersei promised Elia to show you to us.
3507,Jaime,Tyrion,"A cow doesnt need a tongue, only udders.Her Grace learned charm at an early age,"
3508,Tyrion,Tywin,"Cersei even undid your swaddling clothes to give us a better look,You  did have one evil eye, and some black fuzz on your scalp."
3509,Cersei,Tyrion,He shouldnt even have  lived this long.
3510,Cersei,Tyrion,evil eye.
3511,Cersei,Oberyn,Be sure and tell that story to my  father.
3512,Oberyn,Tyrion,"I did have one, but he  had it lopped off."
3513,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Youve grown more amusing since last we met.Yes, but I meant to grow taller.While we are speaking of amusement, I heard a curious tale from Lord Bucklers steward.He claimed  that you had put a tax on womens privy purses.It is a tax on whoring,"
3514,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Only  a penny for each, ah ... act.The Kings Hand felt it might help improve the morals of the city."
3515,Bronn,Tyrion,"Spread your legs for the Halfman, now,I will make certain to keep my pouch full of pennies.Even a prince must pay his taxes.Why should you need to go whoring?"
3516,Ellaria,Oberyn,Did you tire of your paramour on the road?Never.We share too much.
3517,Ellaria,Oberyn,"We have never shared a beautiful blonde  woman, however, and Ellaria is curious.Do you know of such a creature?I am a man wedded."
3518,Ellaria,Oberyn,I no longer frequent whores.
3519,Ellaria,Oberyn,"Its said there are to be seventyseven dishes served at the kings  wedding feast.Are you hungry, my prince?I have hungered for a long time."
3520,Ellaria,Oberyn,"Pray tell me, when will the iustice be served?Justice."
3521,Ellaria,Oberyn,"You were close to your sister?As children Elia and I were inseparable, much like your own brother and sister."
3522,Ellaria,Oberyn,"Wars and weddings have kept us well occupied, Prince Oberyn."
3523,Jon,Robert,"     said the Red Viper, in a tone grown markedly less cordial, "
3524,Gregor,Tyrion,"Before he dies, the Enormity That Rides will tell me whence  came his orders, please assure your lord father of that."
3525,Gregor,Tyrion,"An old septon once claimed I was  living proof of the goodness of the gods.Do you know why that is, Imp?No,Why, if the gods were cruel, they would have made me my mothers firstborn, and Doran her third."
3526,Gregor,Tyrion,"And it is me you must contend with now, not my patient, prudent, and  gouty brother."
3527,Gregor,Tyrion,"You speak like a  man with a great host at his back,yet all I see are three hundred."
3528,Chett,Willas,"Fifty, sixty, seventy thousand roses, in the city or  camped outside it, I cant really say how many are left, but theres more than I care to count, anyway."
3529,Chett,Willas,"In Dome of old before we married Dacron, it was said that all flowers bow before  the sun.Should the roses seek to hinder me Ill gladly trample them underfoot.As you trampled Willas Tyrell?"
3530,Chett,Willas,I had a letter from Willas not half a year past.
3531,Tyrion,Willas,"He wanted another Leo Longthom, and made himself a cripple.There are those who say Ser Loras is better than Leo Longthom. said Tyrion. said Tyrion, "
3532,Oberyn,Tyrion,Chatayas on the Street of Silk has several girls who might suit your needs.
3533,Oberyn,Tyrion,"I would advise you to keep one or the other by your side at all times,  my lord.At all times?"
3534,Oberyn,Tyrion,"And why is that, my good imp?You want to die with a breast in hand, you said."
3535,Beric,Harwin,"Let them carry the word back to Harrenhal,It will  give the Leech Lord and his goat a few more sleepless nights."
3536,Lem,Thoros,"Found him hiding under the cellar steps,"
3537,Lem,Thoros,You are Utt.Septon Utt.A man of god.What god would want the likes o you?
3538,Arya,Lem,"I have sinned,I know, I know."
3539,Arya,Harren,"Oh, grievously have I sinned."
3540,Beric,Shagwell,"Give the dying the gift of mercy  and bind the others hand and foot for trial,"
3541,Beric,Chett,"I  am a weak reed,I pray to the Warrior for strength, but the gods made me weak."
3542,Craster,Qhorin,
3543,Arya,Thoros,"I soldier, I soldier,"
3544,Anguy,Sandor,"Before the war we were four-and-forty, and this was a prosperous place."
3545,Anguy,Arya,"There was one  monster ... we gave him all our silver, but he was certain we were hiding gold, so his men killed us one by  one to make Elder Brother talk.How did the eight of you survive?"
3546,Anguy,Arya,"I am ashamed,It was me.When it came my turn to die, I told them where our gold  was hidden.Brother,the only shame was not telling them at once."
3547,Beric,Lem,"Bugger that,Hes  our god too, and you owe us for your bloody lives."
3548,Beric,Lem,"Might be your Smith can mend a broken sword, but can he heal a broken man?Enough, Lem,Beneath their roof we will honor their rules.The sun will not cease to shine if we miss a prayer or two,I am one who would  know."
3549,Beric,Harren,"Do I frighten you, child?No."
3550,Beric,Lem,Only ... well ...
3551,Beric,Lem,". A wound,A grievous wound, aye, but Thoros healed it.Theres never been  no better healer."
3552,Beric,Lem,"No better healer,Lem, past time to change the watch, Id think.See to  it, if youd be so good.Aye, mlord."
3553,Beric,Lem,"Even brave men blind themselves sometimes, when they are afraid to see,Thoros, how many times have you brought me back now?"
3554,Beric,Lem,"It is Rhllor who brings you back, my lord."
3555,Beric,Thoros,I am only  his instrument.How many times?
3556,Beric,Thoros,"Six,And each time is harder."
3557,Thoros,Tywin,Is death so  very sweet?Sweet?
3558,Stannis,Tywin,Not sweet.Then do not court it so.
3559,Beric,Stannis,A seventh death might mean the end of both of us.
3560,Beric,Stannis,Here is where Ser  Burton Crakehall broke helm and head  with a blow of his mace.
3561,Beric,Stannis,Here  the mark the manticore made at Rushing Falls.
3562,Arya,Thoros,"When I did he hanged them anyway, and me on the gibbet between them."
3563,Arya,Thoros,Here is where the Mountain thrust his dirk through my visor.
3564,Arya,Thoros,Thats thrice I have died at the hands of House Clegane.
3565,Beric,Thoros,Best not  to dwell on it.Can I dwell on what I scarce remember?
3566,Arya,Nan,"Are  you my mother, Thoros?"
3567,Arya,Nan,Could you bring back a man without a head?
3568,Arya,Nan,"Just the once, not six times.Could you?I have no magic, child."
3569,Arya,Thoros,"Life is warmth,  and warmth is fire, and fire is Gods and Gods alone."
3570,Beric,Thoros,"Your father was a good man,Harwin has told me much of him.For his sake, I would  gladly forgo your ransom, but we need the gold too desperately."
3571,Arya,Greenbeard,"The last  harvest burned, this one is drowning, and winter will soon be on us,The smallfolk need grain and seed, and we need blades and horses.Too many of my men ride  rounseys, drays, and mules against foes mounted on coursers and destriers."
3572,Beric,Harren,What if my brother doesnt want to ransom me?Why would you think that?
3573,Beric,Robb,"Well,my hairs messy and my nails are dirty and my feet are all hard."
3574,Gendry,Thoros,"I ruined that gown that Lady  Smallwood gave me, and I dont sew so good."
3575,Gendry,Thoros,"I dont sew very well, I mean.Septa Mordane used to say I had a blacksmiths hands."
3576,Gendry,Thoros,Those soft little things?
3577,Gendry,Thoros,You couldnt even hold a hammer.I could if I wanted!
3578,Beric,Thoros,"Your brother will pay, child.Have no fear on that count.Yes, but what if he wont?"
3579,Beric,Thoros,"Then I will send you to Lady Smallwood for a time, or perhaps to mine own castle  of Blackhaven."
3580,Beric,Yoren,"I do not have the power to give you back your  father, no more than Thoros does, but I can at least see that you are returned safely to your mothers  arms.Do you swear?"
3581,Lem,Yoren,"On my honor as a knight,"
3582,Anguy,Lem,"The Mothers Tears,When Willums Wife Was Wet,Lord Harte Rode Out on a Rainy Day,The Rains of Castamere."
3583,Arya,Gendry,"I could shoe him for you,I was only a prentice, but my master said my  hand was made to hold a hammer."
3584,Gendry,Harwin,"I bet I could make swords too.What are you saying, lad?"
3585,Gendry,Harwin,Ill smith for you.
3586,Beric,Gendry,"If youll have me, mlord, I could be of  use."
3587,Arya,Beric,One of the Mountains men  stole it from me when we was taken.
3588,Arya,Beric,"You would do better serving Lord Tully at Riverrun,I cannot pay for your work.No one ever did."
3589,Arya,Gendry,"Thats enough, mlord.A smith can find a welcome most anywhere."
3590,Arya,Gendry,Why would you choose  to stay with us?
3591,Arya,Gendry,"At the hollow hill, what you said about being  King Roberts men, and brothers, I liked that."
3592,Amory,Tywin,"Id sooner smith for  you.We got plenty of mail needs mending, mlord,Most we took off the dead,  and theres holes where the death came through.You must be a lackwit, boy,Were outlaws."
3593,Beric,Gendry,"You join us, youll end with your neck in a noose, or  your head mounted up above some castle gate.Its no more than theyd do for you,Aye, thats so,The crows await us all * Mlord, the boy seems brave  enough, and we do have need of what he brings us.Take him, says Jack.And quick,before the fever passes and he comes back to his senses."
3594,Beric,Gendry,"Thoros, my sword."
3595,Beric,Gendry,"Gendry, do you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who cannot defend themselves,  to protect all women and children, to obey your captains, your liege lord, and your king, to fight bravely  when needed and do such other tasks as are laid upon you, however hard or humble or dangerous they  may be?I do, mlord.Arise Ser Gendry,  knight of the hollow hill, and be welcome to our brotherhood."
3596,Anguy,Beric,"Making more knights, Dondarrion?"
3597,Anguy,Beric,I ought to kill  you all over again for that.
3598,Anguy,Beric,"Id hoped wed seen the last of you, Clegane.How did you come to find  us?It wasnt hard.You made enough bloody smoke to be seen in Oldtown.Whats become of the sentries I posted?"
3599,Anguy,Beric,Those two blind men?
3600,Anguy,Thoros,What would you do if I  had?
3601,Anguy,Thoros,"Do you wish to die so very much, Sandor?"
3602,Anguy,Thoros,"You must be mad or drunk to follow us here.Drunk on rain?You didnt leave me enough gold to buy a cup of wine, you whoresons."
3603,Anguy,Thoros,Were outlaws.
3604,Anguy,Beric,"Be thankful we didnt kill you.Come try it, Archer.Ill take that quiver off you and shove those arrows up your freckly little arse."
3605,Anguy,Beric,"Why did you come here,  Clegane?To get back whats mine.Your gold?What else?"
3606,Beric,Gendry,"And a robber knight besides, it seems.I gave you a note for your gold,A promise to pay, when the wars done.I wiped my arse with your paper.I want the gold.We dont have it.I sent it south with Greenbeard and the Huntsman, to buy grain and seed across the  Mander.To feed all them whose crops you burned,Is that the tale, now?"
3607,Gendry,Sandor,"As it happens, thats just what I meant to do with  it.Feed a bunch of ugly peasants and their poxy whelps.Youre lying,The boy has a mouth on him, I see."
3608,Arya,Gendry,"Couldnt be my face, could it?"
3609,Arya,Gendry,"You going to make her a knight too, Dondarrion?The first eight-year-old girl  knight?Im twelve,and I could be a knight if I wanted."
3610,Arya,Beric,"Complain to Lem, not me."
3611,Arya,Beric,Do you know what dogs do  to wolves?Next time I will kill you.Ill kill your brother too!No.
3612,Beric,Lem,That you wont.
3613,Beric,Lem,"Say, make my horse a  knight."
3614,Lem,Thoros,"Unless  you meant to steal him too.Best climb on that horse and go,Ill go with my gold.The Lord of Light gave you back your life,He did not proclaim you Baelor  the Blessed come again."
3615,Lem,Sandor,Youre no more than common thieves.
3616,Lem,Sandor,"Your lion friends ride into some village, take all the food and every coin they find, and  call it foraging."
3617,Lem,Sandor,You just been good and foraged.
3618,Harwin,Lem,I best go see what he did to our sentries.
3619,Anguy,Lem,Howd that bloody bastard get all that gold anyhow?
3620,Anguy,Lem,He won the Hands tourney.In Kings Landing.
3621,Anguy,Harwin,"I won a fair  fortune myself, but then I met Dancy, Jayde, and Alayaya.They taught me what roast swan tastes like,  and how to bathe in Arbor wine.Pissed it all away, did you?"
3622,Anguy,Harwin,"Not all.I bought these boots, and this excellent dagger.You ought thave bought some land and made one o them roast swan girls an honest woman,Raised yourself a crop o turnips and a crop o sons.Warrior defend me!What a waste that would have been, to turn my gold to turnips.I like turnips,I could do with some mashed turnips right now."
3623,Harwin,Thoros,"Sandor has lost more than a few bags of coin,He has lost his master and kennel as well."
3624,Anguy,Beric,"That gold was all he had left, it  seems to me.Bloody hell,Hell come murder us in our sleep for sure, then.No."
3625,Anguy,Beric,"Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly, but not in our sleep."
3626,Anguy,Dick,"If you see Clegane still sniffing after us, kill his  horse.Thats a good horse,Aye,Its the bloody rider we should be killing.We could use that horse.Im with Lem,Let me feather the dog a few times, discourage him some."
3627,Beric,Thoros,"Clegane won his life beneath the hollow hill.I will not rob him of it.My lord is wise,Brothers, a trial by battle is a holy thing."
3628,Beric,Harwin,"The Lord of Light is  not yet done with Joffreys Hound, it would seem."
3629,Harwin,Lem,"Puddingfoot was sound asleep, but unharmed.Wait till I get hold of him,Ill cut him a new bunghole.He could have gotten every one of us  killed."
3630,Jaqen,Syrio,"Valar morghulis,Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling."
3631,Arya,Tickler,"Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei."
3632,Craster,Qhorin,"If you  want to be some stupid outlaw knight and get hanged, why should I care?"
3633,Jojen,Meera,"I feel naked,Theres no place to hide.Who holds this land?"
3634,Bran,Jojen,"The Nights Watch,This is the Gift.The New Gift, and north of that Brandons Gift."
3635,Bran,Luwin,"Brandon the Builder gave all the land south of the Wall to the  black brothers, to a distance of twenty-five leagues.For their ... for their  sustenance and support."
3636,Alys,Luwin,"Some maesters say it was  some other Brandon, not the Builder, but its still Brandons Gift."
3637,Alys,Bran,So that was the New Gift.
3638,Alys,Bran,Here.All this.
3639,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor? 
3640,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor?Hodor? This is good land.
3641,Bran,Jojen,"A village, an inn, a  stout holdfast in the lake, all these apple trees ... but where are the people, Bran?Why would they leave  such a place?They were afraid of the wildlings,Wildlings come over the Wall or through the mountains,  to raid and steal and carry off women."
3642,Bran,Jojen,"The Greatjons people get raided too, but not  so much as the people who used to live in the Gift."
3643,Bran,Jojen,We need to shelter here.
3644,Bran,Jojen,A bad one.
3645,Hodor,Meera,"Theres no roof on the inn and only the two walls,We should go out to the holdfast.Hodor,"
3646,Hodor,Meera,"We have no boat, Bran."
3647,Hodor,Meera,Theres a causeway.
3648,Hodor,Meera,We  could walk out.
3649,Jojen,Nan,How do you know that?
3650,Jojen,Nan,"Have you been here before, my  prince?No."
3651,Jojen,Nan,"The holdfast has a golden crown, see?"
3652,Bran,Meera,"Queen Alysanne slept there, so they  painted the merlons gold in her honor.A causeway?"
3653,Bran,Meera,"You are certain?Certain,"
3654,Bran,Hodor,HODOR!
3655,Bran,Meera,"Duck down, Hodor,That hurt,Hodor,"
3656,Bran,Meera,"No way in,"
3657,Bran,Hodor,HODOR!
3658,Bran,Meera,"Look at that, my prince,youre stronger than Hodor."
3659,Hodor,Meera,"Hodor, "
3660,Hodor,Meera,"Hodor,"
3661,Hodor,Meera,"I feel almost a giant, standing high above the world.There are trees in the Neck that stand twice as tall as this,Aye, but they have other trees around them just as high,The world presses close in the  Neck, and the sky is so much smaller."
3662,Hodor,Meera,And look how large the world  has grown.
3663,Bran,Jojen,"I  was hoping we could see the Wall from here,That was stupid, we must still be  fifty leagues away."
3664,Bran,Jojen,"Jojen, what will we do when  we reach the Wall?"
3665,Jojen,Nan,"How are we going to get past to find the  three-eyed crow?There are abandoned castles along the Wall, Ive heard,Fortresses built by the  Nights Watch but now left empty.One of them may give us our way through."
3666,Craster,Qhorin,
3667,Benjen,Bran,Ill stay here in your place.
3668,Bran,Meera,"My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone whenever a castle had to be abandoned,Then well have to open them again,"
3669,Bran,Meera,We shouldnt do that.
3670,Bran,Meera,"We  should just go to Castle Black and tell the Lord Commander to let us pass.Your Grace,we must avoid Castle Black, just as we avoided the kingsroad. said Bran. said Jojen, "
3671,Bran,Jon,"They might decide to hold us or send us back.But my father was a friend of the Nights Watch, and my uncle is First Ranger."
3672,Bran,Jon,And Jons at Castle Black too.
3673,Benjen,Jojen,"I bet the Watch would even give us  horses,Quiet."
3674,Bran,Jojen,Look.
3675,Bran,Jojen,Do you see him?
3676,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor?
3677,Bran,Jojen,"Hodor?He is in no haste,but hes making for this village, it seems to me.We had best go inside, before were seen,Summers near the village,Summer will be fine,Its only one man on a tired horse."
3678,Bran,Meera,"Hes taken shelter in the ruins of the  inn,it looks as though hes making a fire in the hearth.I wish we could have a fire,Im cold."
3679,Hodor,Jojen,We  could have Hodor chop it up and get warm.
3680,Hodor,Jojen,"Hodor,"
3681,Hodor,Jojen,"Fire means smoke.Smoke from this tower could be seen a long way off.If there were anyone to see,Theres a man in the village.One man.One man would be enough to betray Bran to his enemies, if hes the wrong man."
3682,Jojen,Meera,"Come morning the man will go on his way, and we will do  the same."
3683,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor
3684,Bran,Hodor,Hodor!
3685,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor!
3686,Hodor,Jojen,HODOR!HODOR!
3687,Craster,Qhorin,
3688,Bran,Hodor,"Can you get the sword away from him,  Meera?I can try.Hodor, hush,Be quiet now."
3689,Bran,Meera,Sit down.Hodor?
3690,Jojen,Meera,What is it?
3691,Jojen,Meera,Men in the village.The man we saw before?Other men.
3692,Hodor,Meera,"I saw an axe, and spears as well."
3693,Bran,Hodor,"I saw them when the lightning flashed, moving under the trees.How many?Many and more.Too many to count.Mounted?No.Hodor."
3694,Bran,Hodor,Hodor.Hodor.
3695,Jojen,Meera,What if they come out  here?They wont.
3696,Jojen,Meera,Why should they?For shelter.
3697,Jojen,Meera,"Unless the storm lets up.Meera, could you go down and bar the  door?I couldnt even close it."
3698,Hodor,Jojen,"They wont get past those iron gates, though.They might."
3699,Hodor,Jojen,Or climb up through the murder hole as we did.
3700,Bran,Hodor,HODOR!
3701,Bran,Hodor,HODOR!
3702,Bran,Hodor,HODOR!NO!
3703,Bran,Hodor,NO HODORING!
3704,Hodor,Meera,HOOOODOR!
3705,Jojen,Meera,HOOOOOODOOOOOOOR!
3706,Bran,Meera,Be quiet!
3707,Bran,Meera,"Bran, what did you do?"
3708,Bran,Meera,Nothing.
3709,Bran,Meera,I dont know.
3710,Hodor,Jojen,"Something is happening across the lake,I thought I saw a man pointing at the tower."
3711,Meera,Rickon,"Most like theyre just some  Umbers,Or they could be Knotts or Norreys or Flints come down from the mountains, or  even brothers from the Nights Watch.Were they wearing black cloaks, Jojen?By night all cloaks are black, Your Grace.And the flash came and went too fast for me to tell what they  were wearing."
3712,Bran,Meera,"If they were black brothers, theyd be mounted, wouldnt they?"
3713,Bran,Meera,"It doesnt matter,They couldnt get out to us  even if they wanted.Not unless they had a boat, or knew about the causeway.The causeway!"
3714,Bran,Jojen,Our sweet prince!
3715,Bran,Jojen,"Even if they did they could never find the way across  at night in the rain.The night will end, though. Jojen left the rest unsaid.After a few moments he  said, "
3716,Brandon,Ygritte,"Who built that, all of stone like that?"
3717,Brandon,Ygritte,Some king?No.just the men who used to live here.What happened to them?They died or went away.
3718,Brandon,Ygritte,"They were fools to leave such a castle,Its only a towerhouse."
3719,Bran,Brandon,Winterfell has towers three times the size of that.
3720,Bran,Brandon,"How could men build so high, with no giants to lift  the stones?"
3721,Brandon,Jon,Men can build a lot higher than this.In Oldtown theres a tower taller than the Wall.
3722,Benjen,Chett,"Might be after we could come back here, and live in that tower,Would you want that, Jon  Snow?After?"
3723,Benjen,Eddard,"It is a dream for spring, though,Even the promise of land will not lure men north with a winter coming on."
3724,Benjen,Jon,"This land belongs to the Watch,"
3725,Jon,Rattleshirt,"No one lives here.Your raiders drove them off.They were cowards, then.if they wanted the land they should have stayed and fought.Maybe they were tired of fighting."
3726,Jon,Rattleshirt,Its easier to move beyond the reach of raiders.
3727,Jon,Rattleshirt,"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
3728,Jon,Rattleshirt,"You took  the whole world, and built the Wall t keep the free folk out.Did we?"
3729,Jon,Rattleshirt,How did that  happen?The gods made the earth for all men t share.
3730,Jon,Ygritte,A kneeler only has t kneel.Harma and the Bag of Bones  dont come raiding for fish and apples.
3731,Jon,Ygritte,"They grab  every coin and ring and jeweled cup they can find, casks of wine in summer and casks of beef in winter,  and they take women in any season and carry them off beyond the Wall.And what if they do?Id sooner be stolen by a strong man than be given t some weakling by my  father.You say that, but how can you know?What if you were stolen by someone you hated?Hed have t be quick and cunning and brave t steal me."
3732,Jon,Ygritte,"Why would I hate such a man as that? Maybe he never washes, so he smells as rank as a bear.Then Id push him in a stream or throw a bucket o water on him.Anyhow, men shouldnt smell sweet  like flowers.Whats wrong with flowers?Nothing, for a bee.For bed I want one o these."
3733,Jon,Ygritte,What if the man who stole you drank too much?
3734,Jon,Ygritte,What if he was  brutal or cruel?
3735,Jon,Ygritte,"What if he was stronger than you, and liked to  beat you bloody?Id cut his throat while he slept.You know nothing, Jon Snow."
3736,Jon,Mag,"A man can own a woman or a man can own a knife,but no man can own both."
3737,Jon,Mag,"And men cant own the land no moren they can own the sea or the sky.You kneelers think you  do, but Mance is going t show you different."
3738,Big,Errok,"Ygritte,Mance cannot win this  war.He can!"
3739,Big,Errok,"You know nothing, Jon Snow.You have never seen the free folk fight!"
3740,Mance,Ygritte,"I dont doubt that youre all very brave, but when it comes to  battle, discipline beats valor every time."
3741,Mance,Ygritte,All of you.
3742,Jon,Ygritte,"All of us,You too."
3743,Jon,Ygritte,"I swore you werent, so you better not be."
3744,Jon,Ygritte,"Youre mine,Mine, as Im yours."
3745,Jon,Ygritte,But first well live.Yes.
3746,Jon,Ygritte,First well live.
3747,Errok,Jon,castle
3748,Bowen,Mag,"the Old Pomegranate,the Old  BearHes the man you want in front when the foes are in the field,Hell count them right up for you.A regular demon for counting, that one."
3749,Grigg,Jon,"Shes lucky, like your Ygritte.Shes kissed by fire."
3750,Jarl,Jon,"Might be hell be born in some castle,Born in a castle like a lord!castles"
3751,Grigg,Mag,"Theres a village close,Two miles, three.We could shelter there."
3752,Errok,Qhorin,"Theres only one of them,An old man with  a horse."
3753,Jon,Ygritte,"I know this place,That  tower ... look at the top of it the next time the lightning flashes, and tell me what you see.Aye, if you like,Some o the Therms are saying they heard noises out there."
3754,Jon,Ygritte,"We could go out and take a look,I doubt we  could get much wetter than we are.Swimming?In the storm?"
3755,Jon,Ygritte,"Is this a trick t get the clothes off me, Jon  Snow?Do I need a trick for that now?"
3756,Jon,Ygritte,Or is that you cant swim a stroke?
3757,Jon,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow.Im half a fish, Ill have you know.Half fish, half goat, half horse ... theres too many halves to you, Ygritte."
3758,Jon,Ygritte,"We  wouldnt need to swim, if this is the place I think.We could walk."
3759,Jon,Ygritte,Walk on water?What southron sorcery is that?No sorc - 
3760,Jon,Ygritte,Did you look?
3761,Jon,Ygritte,"Did you see?Yellow,Is that what you meant?Some o them standing stones on top were yellow.We call them merlons."
3762,Nan,Ygritte,This is Queenscrown.
3763,Nan,Ygritte,A queen lived there?
3764,Nan,Ygritte,A queen stayed there for a night.
3765,Luwin,Nan,"Alysanne, the wife of King jaehaerys the Conciliator."
3766,Alys,Chett,Afterward the smallfolk painted the top of their holdfast to look like the golden crown shed  worn when she spent the night among them.I have never seen a dragon.No one has.
3767,Alys,Jon,"But this was before that.Queen Alysanne, you say?Good Queen Alysanne, they called her later."
3768,Alys,Jon,"Before her visit they called it Snowgate.If she was so good, she should have torn that Wall down."
3769,Alys,Jon,I had another friend who dreamed of dragons.
3770,Jon,Ygritte,  SNOW!
3771,Jon,Ygritte,Magnar wants.
3772,Mag,Styr,"He must die,Do it, crow."
3773,Jon,Styr,Why do you hesitate?
3774,Jon,Styr,"Kill him, and be done."
3775,Jon,Styr,"Mercy,You have taken my horse, my  coin, my food, let me keep my life,No, please, I have done you no harm."
3776,Jon,Ygritte,"Do it, Jon Snow,You must.T prove you are no crow, but one o the free folk.An old man sitting by a fire?Orell was sitting by a fire too.You killed him quick enough."
3777,Mag,Ygritte,"You meant t kill me too, till you saw I was a woman.And I was asleep.That was different."
3778,Mag,Ygritte,"sentries.Aye, and you crows didnt want V be seen."
3779,Mag,Ygritte,Kill him.
3780,Mag,Ygritte,No.
3781,Mag,Ygritte,"I say yes.I command here.You command Therms,not free folk.I see no free folk.I see a crow and a crow wife.Im no crow wife!"
3782,Jon,Mag,"You know nothing, Jon Snow!"
3783,Hobb,Jon,"A lucky thing my leg got in the way,"
3784,Daenerys,Jorah,"Near enough,"
3785,Daenerys,Jorah,"Five thousand,Id say so."
3786,Daenerys,Jorah,Those are sellswords on the flanks.
3787,Daenerys,Jorah,See the banners?
3788,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Yunkaii hold the center themselves,"
3789,Daenerys,Jorah,Are those slave soldiers they lead?In large part.
3790,Daenerys,Jorah,"Yunkai is known for training bed slaves, not warriors.What say you?Can we defeat this army?Easily,But not bloodlessly."
3791,Daenerys,Jorah,"We might win a battle here, but at such cost we cannot take the city.That is ever a risk, Khaleesi."
3792,Daenerys,Jorah,Yunkai is forewarned.
3793,Daenerys,Jorah,"The  slavers like to talk,Send word that I will hear them this evening in my tent."
3794,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Stormcrows at midday,  the Second Sons two hours later.As you wish,But if they do not come -  They will be curious to see the dragons and hear what I might have to say, and the clever  ones will see it for a chance to gauge my strength."
3795,Daenerys,Jorah,Ill await them in  my pavilion.
3796,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Yunkai has girded up her loins for battle.This is good, Your Grace.These ones thirst for blood."
3797,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Wise Masters have assembled a slave army to meet us.A slave in Yunkai learns the way of seven sighs and the sixteen seats of pleasure, Your Grace."
3798,Daenerys,Jorah,Your Grey Worm hopes to show you.
3799,Craster,Qhorin,
3800,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"But  Grey Worm is the name this one drew the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.If battle is joined, let Grey Worm show wisdom as well as valor,Spare any slave who  runs or throws down his weapon.The fewer slain, the more remain to join us after.This one will remember.I know he will."
3801,Daenerys,Grey Worm,I want you there with my other officers when I treat with the  sellsword captains.
3802,Daenerys,Irri,"Yunkai will have war,"
3803,Daenerys,Drogo,"Missandei, what language will these Yunkaii speak, Valyrian?Yes, Your Grace,A different dialect than Astapors, yet close enough to understand.The slavers name themselves the Wise Masters.Wise?"
3804,Daenerys,Jorah,"We shall see how wise they are,"
3805,Chett,Daenerys,"You would do well to take your rabble  elsewhere,You took Astapor by treachery, but Yunkai shall not fall so easily.Five hundred of your Stormcrows against ten thousand of my Unsullied,I am only a young  girl and do not understand the ways of war, yet these odds seem poor to me.The Stormcrows do not stand alone,Stormcrows do not stand at all."
3806,Chett,Daenerys,"What will it avail you to be staunch, when the  Second Sons change sides?That will not happen,And if it did, it would not matter."
3807,Belwas,Daenerys,We fight beside the stalwart men of Yunkai.You fight beside bed-boys armed with spears.
3808,Belwas,Daenerys,"Once battle is joined, do not think to ask for quarter."
3809,Belwas,Daenerys,"Do you  imagine that Yunkai  will open its gates when my Unsullied are butchering you beneath the walls? Woman, you bray like an ass, and make no more sense.Woman?"
3810,Belwas,Daenerys,"Is that meant to insult me?I would return the slap, if I took you for a man."
3811,Belwas,Daenerys,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons,  khaleesi to Drogos riders, and queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.What you are,is a horselords whore."
3812,Belwas,Daenerys,"Strong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen, if she likes.No, Belwas.I have given these men my safe conduct."
3813,Belwas,Daenerys,"Tell me this - are the Stormcrows  slave or free?We are a brotherhood of free men,Good."
3814,Belwas,Daenerys,"Go back and tell your brothers what I said, then."
3815,Daario,Daenerys,I shall want your answer on the morrow.
3816,Daario,Daenerys,"Our answer is no,"
3817,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"I believe I fucked your twin sister in a pleasure house back home.Or was it you?I think not.I would remember a man of such magnificence, I have no doubt.Yes, that is so.No woman has ever forgotten the Titans Bastard."
3818,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"What say you take those clothes off and come sit on my lap?If you please me, I might bring the  Second Sons over to your side.If you bring the Second Sons over to my side, I might not have you gelded."
3819,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Little girl, another woman once tried to geld me with her teeth."
3820,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Shall I take it out and show you?No need.After my eunuchs cut it off, I can examine it at my leisure."
3821,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"It is true  that I am only a young girl, and do not know the ways of war."
3822,Daenerys,Jorah,"innocent as I am, these odds seem poor to me.The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run."
3823,Daenerys,Jorah,"Or do you deny it?That was many and more years ago, before the Second Sons were led by the Titans Bastard.So it is from you they get their courage?"
3824,Daenerys,Jorah,"When the battle is joined, kill this  one first."
3825,Daenerys,Jorah,"Gladly, Your Grace.Of course,"
3826,Daenerys,Jorah,"Take your Yunkish gold and  go.Had you ever seen the Titan of Braavos, foolish girl, you would know that it has no tail to turn.Then stay, and fight for me.You are worth fighting for, it is true,and I would gladly let you kiss my sword, if I  were free. she said."
3827,Daenerys,Jorah,"Serve me faithfully, and the Second Sons need never  seek hire again."
3828,Jorah,Mero,"As much and more, and perhaps a kiss besides, eh?"
3829,Jorah,Mero,"For a man as magnificent as me?Perhaps.I will like the taste of your tongue, I think."
3830,Jorah,Mero,Think on what Ive  said tonight.Can I have your answer on the morrow?You can.
3831,Jorah,Mero,"Can I have a flagon of this fine wine to take back to my  captains?You may have a tun.It is from the cellars of the Good Masters of Astapor, and I have wagons full of  it.Then give me a wagon.A token of your good regard.You have a big thirst.I am big all over."
3832,Arstan,Mero,"The Titans Bastard does not drink alone, Khaleesi.A wagon it is, if you promise to drink to my health.Done!"
3833,Arstan,Mero,"And done, and done!Three toasts well drink you, and bring you an answer when  the sun comes up."
3834,Arstan,Jorah,"He will drink three toasts to your health tonight, and rape you on the morrow.The old mans right for once,The Second Sons are an old company, and not without  valor, but under Mero theyve turned near as bad as the Brave Companions."
3835,Arstan,Jorah,"None of the Free Cities will hire him any  longer.It is not his reputation that I want, its his five hundred horse.What of the Stormcrows, is there any  hope there?No,That Prendahl is Ghiscari by blood.Likely he had kin in Astapor.A pity."
3836,Arstan,Jorah,Let us wait and hear what the Yunkaii have to say.
3837,Daenerys,Drogo,"Ancient and glorious is Yunkai,  the queen of cities,Our walls are strong, our nobles  proud and fierce, our common folk without fear."
3838,Daenerys,Grey Worm,You shall find no  easy conquest here. Good.My Unsullied will relish a bit of a fight.
3839,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"If blood is what you wish, let it flow."
3840,Daenerys,Grey Worm,Freedom means as much to an Unsullied as a hat to a haddock.
3841,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"Those who survive we shall enslave again, and use to retake  Astapor from the rabble."
3842,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"It is good to see you know who I am,I pride myself on my knowledge of the savage senseless west."
3843,Daenerys,Grey Worm,"And yet, why should we speak thus harshly to one another?"
3844,Chett,Daenerys,"And to prove the truth of that, I have brought you a gift."
3845,Chett,Daenerys,"Fifty thousand golden marks,Yours, as a gesture  of friendship from the Wise Masters of Yunkai."
3846,Chett,Daenerys,"So I say to you, Daenerys Targaryen, take this chest, and go."
3847,Chett,Daenerys,Very pretty.I wonder how many chests like this I shall find when I take your city?
3848,Chett,Daenerys,"None, for that you shall never do.I have a gift for you as well."
3849,Chett,Daenerys,Three days.
3850,Daenerys,Drogo,"What say you?I say, you are mad.Am I?Dracarys."
3851,Daenerys,Drogo,You swore I should have safe  conduct! 
3852,Daenerys,Drogo,Do all the Yunkaii whine so over a singed tokar?
3853,Daenerys,Drogo,"Elsewise, Drogon shall give you a warmer kiss."
3854,Daenerys,Drogo,"Youve  soiled yourself.Take your gold and go, and see that the Wise Masters hear my message."
3855,Daenerys,Drogo,"You shall rue this arrogance, whore."
3856,Daenerys,Rakharo,Do you think it is so hard to kill a dragon?Harder than to kill a slaver.
3857,Daenerys,Rakharo,"By the end of the third day, I will be in  Yunkai, whether you open your gates for me or no."
3858,Daenerys,Rakharo,"Ser Jorah,summon  my bloodriders."
3859,Jorah,Rakharo,"An hour past midnight should be time enough.Yes, Khaleesi,Time for what?To mount our attack."
3860,Jorah,Rakharo,You told the sellswords -  
3861,Daenerys,Mero,"We will take them under cover of this darkness.They will have scouts watching for us.And in the dark, they will see hundreds of campfires burning,If they see anything at all.Khaleesi,I will deal with these scouts. she agreed."
3862,Grey Worm,Jorah,Slave  soldiers will never stand before mounted Dothraki.
3863,Daenerys,Jorah,"To be sure, I am only a young girl and  know little of war.What do you think, my lords? I think you are Rhaegar Targaryens sister,Aye,and a queen as well."
3864,Belwas,Jorah,The Unsullied  caught one of the sellswords trying to sneak into the camp.A spy?
3865,Belwas,Daario,He claims to come bearing gifts.its the yellow fool with the blue hair.
3866,Belwas,Daario,"That one.Ill hear him, then."
3867,Daario,Daenerys,"Khaleesi,I bring gifts and glad tidings."
3868,Daario,Daenerys,And so is Daario Naharis!
3869,Daario,Daenerys,What do Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor say of this?Little.
3870,Daario,Drogo,My gifts to the dragon queen.
3871,Daenerys,Drogo,You did this?
3872,Daario,Daenerys,None other.
3873,Daario,Daenerys,Why?Because you are so beautiful.
3874,Daario,Daenerys,Prendahl talked too much and said too little.
3875,Chett,Daenerys,And Sallor picked his nose as if his snot was gold.
3876,Daario,Daenerys,Are you skilled in the use of those handsome blades?
3877,Daario,Daenerys,"Prendahl and Sallor would tell you so, if dead men could talk."
3878,Daario,Daenerys,"I  would tell you the names of all the men I have slain, but before I could finish your dragons would grow  large as castles, the walls of Yunkai would crumble into yellow dust, and winter would come and go and  come again."
3879,Daario,Daenerys,Draw your sword and swear it to  my service.
3880,Daario,Jorah,My sword is yours.
3881,Daario,Jorah,"I live and die at your command, fair queen.Then live,and fight for me tonight.That would not be wise, my queen."
3882,Daario,Jorah,Keep this one here  under guard until the battles fought and won.
3883,Daario,Daenerys,"If he can give us the Stormcrows, surprise is certain.And if he betrays you, surprise is lost."
3884,Daario,Daenerys,He wont.How can you know that?
3885,Daario,Jorah,I would  call that proof of his sincerity.
3886,Daario,Jorah,"Can you get back safely?If they stop me, I will say I have been scouting, and saw nothing."
3887,Daenerys,Jorah,"Your Grace,that was a mistake.We know nothing  of this man -    "
3888,Daenerys,Jorah,"Five hundred sellswords of uncertain loyalty.All loyalties are uncertain in such times as these,"
3889,Daario,Jorah,"Dacnerys, I am thrice your age,I have seen how false men are."
3890,Daario,Jorah,Even his beard wears false colors.
3891,Daario,Jorah,"Whilst you have an honest beard, is that what you are telling me?You are the only  man I should ever trust?"
3892,Daario,Jorah,"I did not say that.You say it every day.Pyat Prees a liar, Xaros a schemer, Belwas a braggart, Arstan an assassin ... do  you think Im still some virgin girl, that I cannot hear the words behind the words?Your Grace - You have been a better friend to me than any I have known, a better brother than  Viserys ever was."
3893,Daenerys,Jorah,"It will not serve, and it will not make me love you any better."
3894,Daenerys,Jorah,"If my queen commands,"
3895,Daenerys,Jorah,"She does,She commands."
3896,Daenerys,Jorah,You have a battle to fight and win.
3897,Drogo,Mirri,"You must be my children,my three fierce children."
3898,Daenerys,Missandei,"Bring me Arstan,"
3899,Arstan,Drogo,"I cannot sleep when men are dying for me, Whitebeard, Tell me more of my  brother Rhaegar, if you would.I liked the tale you told me on the ship, of how he decided that he must  be a warrior.Your Grace is kind to say so.Viserys said that our brother won many tourneys."
3900,Arstan,Daenerys,It is not meet for me to deny His Graces words...But?
3901,Arstan,Daenerys,"Tell me.I command it.Prince Rhaegars prowess was unquestioned, but he seldom entered the lists."
3902,Daenerys,Jaime,"Men  said that he loved his harp much better than his lance.He won some tourneys, surely,When he was young, His Grace rode brilliantly in a tourney at Storms End, defeating Lord Steffon  Baratheon, Lord Jason Mallister, the Red Viper of Dome, and a mystery knight who proved to be the  infamous Simon Toyne, chief of the kingswood outlaws.He broke twelve lances against Ser Arthur  Dayne that day.Was he the champion, then?No, Your Grace.That honor went to another knight of the Kingsguard, who unhorsed Prince Rhaegar  in the final tilt."
3903,Daenerys,Jaime,But what tourneys did my brother win?Your Grace.
3904,Daenerys,Jaime,He won the greatest tourney of them all.Which was that?
3905,Daenerys,Jaime,"The tourney Lord Whent staged at Harrenhal beside the Gods Eye, in the year of the false spring."
3906,Daenerys,Harren,"The greatest lords and mightiest champions of the Seven Kingdoms  rode in that tourney, and the Prince of Dragonstone bested them all.But that was the tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty!"
3907,Daenerys,Harren,"Princess Elia was there, his wife, and yet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole her  away from her betrothed."
3908,Daenerys,Harren,"Did the Dornish woman treat him so ill?It is not for such as me to say what might have been in your brothers heart, Your Grace.The Princess  Elia was a good and gracious lady, though her health was ever delicate."
3909,Daenerys,Viserys,"Viserys said once that it was my fault, for being  born too late."
3910,Daenerys,Viserys,"If I had been born more timely, he said,  Rhaegar would have married me instead of Elia, and it would all have come out different.If Rhaegar had  been happy in his wife, he would not have needed the Stark girl.Perhaps so, Your Grace."
3911,Daenerys,Viserys,"But I am not certain it was in Rhaegar to be  happy.You make him sound so sour,Not sour, no, but ... there was a melancholy to Prince Rhaegar, a sense ."
3912,Daenerys,Viserys,. 
3913,Daenerys,Viserys,"Say it,A sense ...?."
3914,Daenerys,Viserys,"He was born in grief, my queen, and that shadow hung over him all his days."
3915,Daenerys,Viserys,"It was the  shadow of Surnmerhall that haunted him, was it not?Yes."
3916,Arstan,Robert,"When you heard him play his high harp with the silver strings and sing of twilights and tears and the death  of kings, you could not but feel that he was singing of himself and those he loved.What of the Usurper?Did he play sad songs as well?"
3917,Arstan,Robert,Robert?
3918,Craster,Qhorin,"  As one, her dragons lifted their heads and roared."
3919,Belwas,Jorah,"Irri, go see who.. . "
3920,Craster,Qhorin,
3921,Daenerys,Jorah,We have several thousand captives.Our own losses?A dozen.If that many.
3922,Daenerys,Jorah,"Rise, my good brave bear."
3923,Daenerys,Jorah,Or the Titans  Bastard?Grazdan went to Yunkai to deliver your terms.
3924,Daenerys,Jorah,"Mero fled, once he realized  the Stormcrows had turned."
3925,Daenerys,Jorah,"He shouldnt escape us long.Very well,Sellsword or slave, spare all those who will pledge me their faith.If enough of  the Second Sons will join us, keep the company intact."
3926,Daenerys,Missandei,Mhysa!
3927,Daenerys,Missandei,Mhysa!Mhysa!
3928,Daenerys,Missandei,"What are they shouting?It is Ghiscari, the old pure tongue.It means Mother."
3929,Daenerys,Missandei,Mhysa!
3930,Daenerys,Missandei,Mhysa!MHYSA!
3931,Daenerys,Missandei,"Maela,AelallaQatheiTato,"
3932,Daenerys,Jorah,"They will not hurt me,They are my children, Jorah."
3933,Arya,Daenerys,"Mother,Mother,Mother, Mother, Mother!"
3934,Arya,Eddard,What is he doing?
3935,Arya,Eddard,"Sometimes he sees things in the flames,The past."
3936,Arya,Eddard,Things happening far  away.
3937,Gendry,Thoros,Can you truly see  the future there?
3938,Gendry,Thoros,Not here.
3939,Gendry,Thoros,"But some days, yes, the Lord of Light grants  me visions."
3940,Gendry,Thoros,"My master said you were a sot and a fraud, as bad a priest as there ever was.That was unkind."
3941,Gendry,Thoros,"True, but unkind."
3942,Gendry,Thoros,"Did I know you,  boy?I was prenticed to the master armorer Tobho Mott, on the Street of Steel.You used to buy your  swords from him.Just so.He charged me twice what they were worth, then scolded me for setting them afire."
3943,Gendry,Thoros,Your master had it right.
3944,Aerys,Thoros,"I had a gift for tongues, though."
3945,Aerys,Beric,"King Robert was fond of me, though, The first time I rode into a melee with a flaming sword, Kevan  Lannisters horse reared and threw him and His Grace laughed so hard I thought he might rupture."
3946,Beric,Thoros,"It was no way to treat a blade, though, your master had the right of that  too.Fire consumes,it consumes, and when it is done there is nothing left.Nothing.Beric.Sweet friend."
3947,Beric,Thoros,What are you saying?Nothing I have not said before.
3948,Anguy,Thoros,Six times is too many.
3949,Beric,Lem,"The Ember and the Lemon come to honor me again, and His  Grace the Lord of Corpses.An ill-omened name.I have asked you not to use it.Aye, you have.But the stink of death is fresh on you, my lord."
3950,Beric,Lem,Give me wine or I will go.
3951,Beric,Lem,"My joints ache when the  winds do blow, and up here the winds are always blowing.A silver stag for your dreams, my lady,Another if you have  news for us.I cannot eat a silver stag, nor ride one.A skin of wine for my dreams, and for my news a kiss from the  great oaf in the yellow cloak."
3952,Beric,Lem,"Aye, a sloppy kiss, a bit of tongue."
3953,Beric,Lem,"I am too old.Aye,Too old for wine and kisses.All youll get from me is the flat of my sword,  crone.My hair comes out in handfuls and no one has kissed me for a thousand years."
3954,Beric,Lem,"A song from Tom o Sevens, for my news.You will have your song from Tom,"
3955,Craster,Qhorin,"Sour wine for sour tidings, what could be more  fitting?"
3956,Arya,Lem,"Which bloody king is dead, crone?"
3957,Arya,Hoster,"In the hall of kings,  the goat sits alone and fevered as the great dog descends on him."
3958,Beric,Gregor,"I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard his grief,I dreamt  such a clangor I thought my head might burst, drums and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest  sound was the little bells."
3959,Arya,Beric,"And later I dreamt that maid again, slaying a savage giant in a castle built of snow."
3960,Arya,Beric,"You cannot hide from me, child.Come closer, now."
3961,Arya,Thoros,"I see you,I see you, wolf child."
3962,Arya,Thoros,. 
3963,Arya,Thoros,"You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel."
3964,Arya,Thoros,Begone!
3965,Lem,Thoros,"Dont frighten the child,Theres no harm in her."
3966,Beric,Lem,"Dont be so bloody sure of that.She will leave on the morrow, with us,Were taking her to  Riverrun, to her mother.Nay,Youre not."
3967,Beric,Lem,For theres to be a wedding.
3968,Beric,Lem,"Look in your fires, pink priest, and  you will see."
3969,Beric,Lem,And they remember when the  First Men came with fire in their fists.
3970,Beric,Lem,Ill have my payment now.Ill have the song you promised  me.
3971,Beric,Lem,The same song as before?
3972,Lem,Thoros,"Oh, aye."
3973,Arya,Thoros,Is there another?
3974,Arya,Thoros,"Let her savor her song  in peace,It is all she has left."
3975,Arya,Thoros,"What did she mean about the Twins?My mothers at Riverrun,  isnt she?She was."
3976,Arya,Thoros,"A wedding, she said."
3977,Arya,Thoros,"Whenever she  is, Lord Beric will find her, though."
3978,Eddard,Gendry,"When I wear my helm, the rain  beats against the steel and gives me headaches,But when I take it off, my hair gets  soaked and sticks to my face and in my mouth.You have a knife,If your hair annoys you so much, shave your bloody head."
3979,Arya,Eddard,How long have you been Lord Berics squire?
3980,Arya,Eddard,He took me for his page when he espoused my aunt.
3981,Arya,Eddard,"I was seven, but when I turned ten  he raised me to squire.I won a prize once, riding at rings.I never learned the lance, but I could beat you with a sword,Have you killed anyone?"
3982,Arya,Beric,Im only twelve.
3983,Arya,Beric,"Youve been in  battles, though.Yes."
3984,Arya,Beric,I was at the Mummers Ford.
3985,Arya,Harren,"When we  regrouped, Green Gergen helped pull his lordship back onto a horse."
3986,Chiswyck,Eddard,"My father was called Eddard too,I know."
3987,Chiswyck,Eddard,"I wanted to go up and speak with him, but I couldnt think  what to say."
3988,Chiswyck,Eddard,Were you at the tourney?
3989,Chiswyck,Eddard,Ser Loras Tyrell gave her a rose.She told me.
3990,Chiswyck,Eddard,Her friend Jeyne Poole fell in love with your Lord Beric.Hes promised to my aunt.
3991,Eddard,Jon,"That was before, though."
3992,Eddard,Jon,.
3993,Eddard,Jon,My lady?
3994,Eddard,Jon,You have a basebom brother ... Jon Snow? Hes with the Nights Watch on the Wall.
3995,Craster,Qhorin,"Jon looks like me, even though hes  bastard-bom."
3996,Arya,Jon,How do you know about Jon? He is my milk brother.Brother?
3997,Arya,Jon,But youre from Dome.How could you and Jon be blood?Milk brothers.
3998,Arya,Eddard,"My lady mother had no milk when I was little, so Wylla had to nurse me."
3999,Arya,Eddard,Whos Wylla?Jon Snows mother.
4000,Arya,Eddard,Since before I was bom.Jon never knew his mother.Not even her name.
4001,Arya,Eddard,You know her?Truly?
4002,Arya,Eddard,"if you lie Ill punch your face.Wylla was my wetnurse,I swear it on the honor of my House.You have a House?"
4003,Eddard,Gendry,Who are you?My lady?
4004,Eddard,Gendry,"Im Edric Dayne, the ... the Lord of Starfall."
4005,Arya,Gendry,"Lords and ladies,"
4006,Arya,Eddard,"Ow,That hurt."
4007,Arya,Eddard,"What kind of lady throws crabapples at people?The bad kind,"
4008,Arya,Eddard,"Im sorry I didnt know who you  were.My lord.The fault is mine, my lady."
4009,Jon,Wyl,little sister.
4010,Asha,Eddard,"There was an Arthur Dayne,The one they called the  Sword of the Morning.My father was Ser Arthurs elder brother."
4011,Arya,Eddard,She  threw herself into the sea from atop the Palestone Sword before I was born.Why would she do that?
4012,Arya,Eddard,Your lord father  never spoke of her?
4013,Arya,Sansa,"The Lady Ashara Dayne, of Starfall?No.Did he know her?Before Robert was king.She met your father and his brothers at Harrenhal, during the year of the false  spring.Oh."
4014,Arya,Sansa,"Why did she jump in the sea, though? Her heart was broken."
4015,Arya,Eddard,Did someone break it?
4016,Eddard,Gendry,Perhaps its not my place.
4017,Eddard,Gendry,Tell me.
4018,Arya,Gendry,My aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at  Harrenhal - Thats not so.  
4019,Arya,Gendry,"My father had honor,And we werent talking to you anyway.Why dont you go back to Stoney Sept and ring that girls stupid    bells? "
4020,Arya,Gendry,"At least your father raised his bastard, not like mine."
4021,Arya,Eddard,Thats all I  know of him.
4022,Arya,Eddard,"Well, if he was here now, might be Id beat him bloody.But hes dead, I figure,  and your fathers dead too, so what does it matter who he lay with?"
4023,Anguy,Eddard,"Dornishmen lie, dont they?Theyre famous for it."
4024,Arya,Eddard,"Of course, they say the same of us marchers, so there  you are."
4025,Arya,Eddard,  
4026,Asha,Harwin,"Where do you think youre going, milady?"
4027,Asha,Harwin,"There are wolves in these woods, and worse things.Im not afraid,That boy Eddard said..."
4028,Asha,Eddard,"I heard it once at Winterfell, when I was  no older than you are now."
4029,Brandon,Eddard,I doubt  theres any truth to it.
4030,Arya,Catelyn,"Spring had come,  or so they thought, and neither one of them was pledged.She killed herself, though,Eddard says she jumped from a tower into the sea.So she did,but that was for grief, Id wager."
4031,Anguy,Arya,"Let it lie, my lady."
4032,Anguy,Arya,"Let it lie ... and please, when we come to Riverrun, say naught of this to your mother."
4033,Anguy,Arya,Did the Lannisters kill the people who lived here?
4034,Anguy,Arya,No.
4035,Anguy,Arya,Look at how thick the moss grows on the stones.
4036,Gendry,Robert,"This place was put to the torch a long time  ago.Who did it, then?"
4037,Gendry,Robert,Hoster Tully.
4038,Gendry,Robert,This was Lord    Goodbrooks village.
4039,Arya,Gendry,"After the Trident, Goodbrooks son made his peace with  Robert and Lord Hoster, but that didnt help the dead none."
4040,Arya,Thoros,"I say we need a fire,The night is dark and full of terrors."
4041,Arya,Thoros,Too very wet.
4042,Arya,Lem,Riverrun.
4043,Lem,Lysa,"I  must be mad, to be going back to Riverrun,The Tullys have never been lucky  for old Tom."
4044,Beric,Thoros,   Thoros said.
4045,Beric,Thoros,My  lord.
4046,Beric,Thoros,"Tell her,"
4047,Beric,Thoros,"My lady,"
4048,Arya,Thoros,Riverrun will soon come under attack. 
4049,Arya,Thoros,"No!Sweetling,"
4050,Arya,Thoros,The Lannisters will soon have Riverrun under siege.Robb will beat them.
4051,Arya,Thoros,"Hell beat them like he did before.Your brother may be gone,Your mother as well."
4052,Arya,Lem,. 
4053,Beric,Lem,"If you hadnt caught me, I would have been there.I would have been  home."
4054,Beric,Lem,"My lady,"
4055,Arya,Brynden,"Would he know you,  perchance?"
4056,Brynden,Lem,"Small chance the Brynden will pay good coin for a girl he doesnt know,Those Tullys are  a sour, suspicious lot, hes like to think were selling him false goods.Well convince him,She will, or Harwin."
4057,Beric,Lem,"I say we take  her there, get the gold, and be bloody well done with her.And if the lions catch us inside the castle?"
4058,Beric,Lem,"Theyd like nothing better than to hang his  lordship in a cage from the top of Casterly Rock.I do not mean to be taken,"
4059,Arya,Beric,"Still, we dare not go blindly here."
4060,Arya,Small,. 
4061,Arya,Sandor,"Youre hurting me,Let go, I was going to go back, I ."
4062,Arya,Sandor,. Back?
4063,Arya,Sandor,"Bugger that, wolf girl.Youre mine."
4064,Brienne,Roose,"I am sending Qybum with you, to look after you on the way to Kings Landing,He has a fond hope that your father will force the Citadel to give him back  his chain, in gratitude.We all have fond hopes.If he grows me back a hand, my father will make him Grand Maester."
4065,Aenys,Jaime,"The Trident is in flood,Even at the ruby ford, the crossing will be difficult.You will give  my warm regards to your father?So long as you give mine to Robb Stark.That I shall."
4066,Jaime,Pyg,Zollo.
4067,Rorge,Shagwell,"And Rorge, did you come to kiss me goodbye?Bugger off, cripple,If you insist."
4068,Jaime,Rorge,A Lannister always pays his debts.
4069,Cersei,Jaime,The kingsroad would be faster.
4070,Cersei,Joffrey,"I want no trouble,Gods know who wed meet along that kingsroad.No one you need fear, surely?You have two hundred men.Aye."
4071,Jaime,Joffrey,"Mlord said to bring you safe to your lord father, and thats what I  mean to do."
4072,Aerys,Jaime,"The tourneys back the other way, ser."
4073,Aerys,Jaime,"Hell win no glory here,Hes mine now, not Tywins."
4074,Aerys,Jaime,"I rule, and hell obey."
4075,Jaime,Qyburn,Is your hand troubling you?The lack of my hand is troubling me. 
4076,Jaime,Qyburn,"I understand you had a visitor last night,I trust that you enjoyed her?"
4077,Jaime,Qyburn,She did not say who sent her.
4078,Jaime,Pia,"Your fever was largely gone, and I thought you might enjoy a bit of  exercise."
4079,Jaime,Pia,willing.
4080,Jaime,Qyburn,"I was a slip of a girl when you came for Lord Whents tourney  and the king gave you your cloak,You were so handsome all in white, and everyone  said what a brave knight you were."
4081,Jaime,Qyburn,"I never truly thought Id have you, though."
4082,Jaime,Qyburn,Do you send girls to everyone you leech?
4083,Jaime,Qyburn,More often Lord Vargo sends them to me.
4084,Jaime,Pia,As  is your maid of Tarth.
4085,Jaime,Pia,Brienne?Yes.
4086,Jaime,Qyburn,"As of last night, at least."
4087,Jaime,Qyburn,"He sent you to examine her?To be sure.He is ... fastidious, shall we say?Does this concern the ransom?"
4088,Jaime,Qyburn,Does her father require proof she is still maiden?You have not heard?
4089,Jaime,Qyburn,We had a bird from Lord Selwyn.
4090,Brienne,Vargo,"He is convinced the Evenstar intends to cheat him.Three hundred dragons is a fair ransom for a knight.The goat should take what he can get.The goat is Lord of Harrenhal, and the Lord of Harrenhal does not haggle."
4091,Brienne,Jaime,"If her maidenheads as hard as the rest of her, the goat will break his  cock off trying to get in,"
4092,Jaime,Walton,Shouldnt you northmen have a  different sort of peace banner?
4093,Jaime,Walton,"What are the Seven to you?Southron gods,but its a southron peace we need, to get you safe to your father."
4094,Stafford,Tywin,"Send back my lord and love, or these three shall answer for any  harm that comes him,"
4095,Chett,Jaime,"Its an honor to have a knight of the Kingsguard  under my roof, ser,Its a tale Ill tell my grandchildren."
4096,Jaime,Qyburn,I mislike this place.Well ride on.
4097,Chett,Jaime,Who are you?
4098,Chett,Jaime,What business do you have in Casterly Rock?
4099,Joffrey,Tywin,What place is this? Your place.
4100,Jaime,Joffrey,"Sister, why has Father brought us here?Us?"
4101,Jaime,Joffrey,This is your darkness.
4102,Jaime,Tywin,"Stay with me,Dont leave me here alone."
4103,Jaime,Tywin,Dont leave me in  the dark!
4104,Jaime,Tywin,"Give me a sword, at least.I gave you a sword,"
4105,Brienne,Jaime,"I swore to keep you safe,I swore an oath."
4106,Brienne,Jaime,Ser.
4107,Brienne,Jaime,If you would be so  good.
4108,Brienne,Jaime,"A sword,"
4109,Brienne,Cersei,"The flames will bum so long as you live,When they die, so must you.Sister!"
4110,Brienne,Cersei,Stay with me.Stay!
4111,Brienne,Jaime,Do they keep a bear down here?
4112,Brienne,Jaime,A cave lion?
4113,Brienne,Jaime,What lives in the darkness?Doom.
4114,Brienne,Jaime,Only doom.
4115,Cersei,Jaime,I mislike this place.Im not fond of it myself.
4116,Brienne,Cersei,My feet are wet.We could go back the way they brought us.if you climbed on my shoulders youd have no trouble  reaching that tunnel mouth.
4117,Brienne,Cersei,Listen.
4118,Brienne,Cersei,Something  comes.
4119,Brienne,Cersei,"There,"
4120,Brienne,Jaime,"Two riders, side by side.Down here, beneath the Rock?"
4121,Brienne,Jaime,"Is it you, Stark?"
4122,Brienne,Jaime,"Come ahead.I never feared you living, I do not fear you dead."
4123,Brienne,Jaime,There are more.
4124,Arthur,Gerold,"You dont frighten me,"
4125,Arthur,Jaime,I will fight you one by one or all together.
4126,Arthur,Jaime,"She gets cross  when you leave her out.I swore an oath to keep him safe,I swore a holy oath.We all swore oaths,"
4127,Jaime,Lewyn,"He was going to bum the city,To leave Robert only ashes.He was your king,You swore to keep him safe,And the children, them as well,"
4128,Jaime,Lewyn,I left my wife and children in  your hands.I never thought hed hurt them.
4129,Arthur,Jaime,I was with the king.
4130,Arthur,Lewyn,"Killing the king,Cutting his throat,The king you had sworn to die for,"
4131,Brienne,Cersei,"No,no, no, no."
4132,Qyburn,Walton,My lord.
4133,Qyburn,Walton,What is it?I heard you  cry out.
4134,Jaime,Walton,What is it?Why did you scream?A dream ... only a dream.
4135,Jaime,Walton,"I was in the dark,  but I had my hand back."
4136,Jaime,Qyburn,You still have a touch of fever.A fever dream.
4137,Jaime,Qyburn,Help me.
4138,Jaime,Qyburn,Another cup of dreamwine?
4139,Jaime,Qyburn,No.Ive dreamt enough this night.
4140,Jaime,Qyburn,"Milk of the poppy, then?"
4141,Jaime,Qyburn,To rest.
4142,Aerys,Qyburn,"Do you believe in ghosts, Maester?"
4143,Aerys,Qyburn,"Once, at the Citadel, I came into an empty room and saw an empty chair."
4144,Jaime,Qyburn,"If we leave our smells behind us when we leave  a room, surely something of our souls must remain when we leave this life?"
4145,Jaime,Qyburn,"The archmaesters did not like my thinking, though.Well, Marwyn did, but he was the only one."
4146,Jaime,Qyburn,"Walton,saddle the horses."
4147,Jaime,Tyrion,"I left something at Harrenhal.Lord Vargo holds it now.Him and his Bloody Mummers.You have twice the men he does.If I dont serve you up to your father as commanded, Lord Bolton will have my hide.We press on to  Kings Landing."
4148,Tyrion,Walton,"Lannisters lie, Steelshanks.Didnt Lord Bolton tell you that?"
4149,Jaime,Walton,"What if he did?Unless you take me back to Harrenhal, the song I sing my father may not be one the Lord of the  Dreadfort would wish to hear.I might even say it was Bolton ordered my hand cut off, and Steelshanks  Walton who swung the blade."
4150,Jaime,Walton,"That isnt so.No, but who will my father believe?"
4151,Jaime,Walton,It will be so much easier if we just go back.
4152,Harren,Walton,"Youd get  the girl, and a nice fat purse of gold as thanks.Gold?"
4153,Harren,Walton,How much gold?
4154,Harren,Walton,"Why, how much would you want?"
4155,Jaime,Qyburn,"You in there!Open your gates, or Ill kick them down!"
4156,Qyburn,Walton,"Get what you came back for, and well be gone again,I  want no trouble with the Mummers.Tell your men to keep their hands on their sword hilts, and the Mummers will want no trouble with you.Two to one, remember?"
4157,Jaime,Vargo,"This is none of our concern,Lord Bolton said the wench was theirs, to do  with as they liked.Her names Brienne."
4158,Jaime,Vargo,"Lord Vargo,"
4159,Jaime,Vargo,Kingthlayer?
4160,Gregor,Jaime,"Pull her out of there.Thay out of thith, Kingthlayer, unleth youd like another thump."
4161,Gregor,Jaime,Your thee-mooth bit oth my ear.Thmall wonder her father will not ranthom  thuch a freak.
4162,Brienne,Jaime,Kill him!
4163,Brienne,Jaime,You gave her a tourney sword.
4164,Brienne,Jaime,of courth.Ill pay her bloody ransom.
4165,Brienne,Jaime,Pull her out of there.You want her?Go get her.
4166,Brienne,Jaime,Kingslayer?
4167,Brienne,Jaime,Jaime.
4168,Brienne,Jaime,What are you doing here?Something stupid.Get behind me.
4169,Brienne,Jaime,You get behind.I have the sword.A swordwith no point and no edge.Get behindme!
4170,Vargo,Zollo,You thlew my bear!
4171,Jaime,Vargo,"And Ill serve you the same if you give me trouble,Were taking the wench.Her name is Brienne,Brienne, the maid of Tarth.You are still maiden, I hope?"
4172,Jaime,Vargo,"Yes.Oh, good,I only rescue maidens."
4173,Jaime,Rorge,"Now fetch some ropes and get us out of here.Bugger that,Kill them, Hoat.Or youll bloody well wish you had!"
4174,Harren,Rorge,"Pull them out,I  hath chothen to be merthiful."
4175,Jaime,Walton,"Are you mad, Kingslayer?"
4176,Jaime,Walton,"No man can fight a bear  with his bare hands!One bare hand and one bare stump,But I hoped    youd kill the beast before the beast killed me.Elsewise, Lord Bolton would have peeled you like an  orange, no?"
4177,Brienne,Jaime,Ser Jaime?
4178,Brienne,Jaime,"I am grateful, but... you were well away.Why come back?"
4179,Catelyn,Jaime,"I dreamed of  you,"
4180,Catelyn,Lothar,"Queen Jeyne has a loving heart, I see,Not unlike my own sisters."
4181,Edmure,Roslin,By the morrow shell be holding swatches of Riverrun red-and-blue to her  cheek to picture how shell look in her brides cloak.
4182,Edmure,Lothar,"But  you are strangely quiet, Lord Tully.How do you feel, I wonder?Much as I did at the Stone Mill just before the warhorns sounded,"
4183,Catelyn,Lothar,"Let us pray your marriage ends as happily, my lord."
4184,Catelyn,Robb,"Walder Frey has a  sharp tongue and a long memory,I do not doubt that you are strong enough to  suffer an old mans rebukes as the price of his allegiance, but you have too much of your father in you to  sit there while he insults Jeyne to her face."
4185,Catelyn,Maege,"We are stronger than we seem, my lady,"
4186,Catelyn,Dacey,"I have fought beside the Young Wolf in every battle,He has not lost  one yet."
4187,Catelyn,Edmure,"You dont suppose all Lord Walders daughters look like him, do  you?"
4188,Catelyn,Edmure,"With so many different mothers, a few of the maids are bound to turn up comely,but why should the old wretch give you a pretty one?No reason at all,"
4189,Catelyn,Edmure,"Cersei Larmister is comely,Youd be wiser to  pray that Roslin is strong and healthy, with a good head and a loyal heart."
4190,Catelyn,Edmure,"The river hasnt run this  high since sprin&And if this rain keeps falling, it will go higher yet.Theres a bridge further upstream, near Oldstones,Its older and smaller, but if it still stands - Its gone, my lady,Washed away even before the one at Fairmarket."
4191,Catelyn,Robb,Is there another bridge?No.And the fords will be impassable.
4192,Catelyn,Edmure,"If we cannot cross the Blue Fork, well  have to go around it, through Sevenstreams and Hags Mire.Bogs and bad roads, or none at all,The going will be slow, but well get there, I  suppose.Lord Walder will wait, Im sure,Lothar sent him a bird from Riverrun, he knows we are  coming.Yes, but the man is prickly, and suspicious by nature,He may take this delay as a  deliberate insult.Very well, Ill beg his pardon for our tardiness as well.A sorry king Ill be, apologizing with every  second breath."
4193,Catelyn,Robb,I hope Bolton got across the Trident before the rains began.
4194,Catelyn,Robb,"Even afoot, he should reach the Twins before  us.And when youve joined his men to yours and seen my brother married, what then?"
4195,Catelyn,Robb,North.
4196,Catelyn,Robb,By the causeway?Against Moat Cailin?
4197,Catelyn,Robb,"Thats one way to go,"
4198,Petyr,Robb,Does this castle have a name?
4199,Petyr,Robb,"Oldstones, all the smallfolk called it when I was a girl, but no doubt it had some other name when it was  still a hall of kings."
4200,Catelyn,Petyr,"Theres a song,Jenny of Oldstones, with the flowers in her hair.Were all just songs in the end.If we are lucky."
4201,Petyr,Robb,"Whose grave is this?Here lies Tristifer, the Fourth of His Name, King of the Rivers and the Hills."
4202,Petyr,Robb,"He ruled from the Trident to the Neck, thousands of years before jenny and her prince, in  the days when the kingdoms of the First Men were falling one after the other before the onslaught of the  Andals."
4203,Robb,Tristifer,"He fought a hundred battles and won nine-and-ninety,  or so the singers say, and when he raised this castle it was the strongest in Westeros."
4204,Robb,Tristifer,"He died in his hundredth battle, when seven Andal kings joined forces against him."
4205,Robb,Tristifer,"With Tristifer the Fifth died House Mudd, that had ruled the riverlands for a thousand years before  the Andals came.His heir failed him."
4206,Robb,Tristifer,"I had hoped to leave Jeyne with  child ... we tried often enough, but Im not certain."
4207,Robb,Tristifer,. It does not always happen the first time.
4208,Robb,Tyrion,"Nor even the hundredth.You are  very young.Young, and a king,A king must have an heir."
4209,Catelyn,Tyrion,"By law Sansa is next in line of succession, so Winterfell and the north would pass  to her."
4210,Catelyn,Tyrion,"To her, and her lord husband."
4211,Catelyn,Tyrion,"That dwarf must never have the north.No,You must name another heir, until such time as Jeyne gives you a son."
4212,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Your fathers father had no siblings, but his father had a sister who married a  younger son of Lord Raymar Royce, of the junior branch."
4213,Jon,Robb,. Mother.
4214,Jon,Robb,You forget.My father had four sons.
4215,Jon,Robb,A Snow is not a Stark.Jons more a Stark than some lordlings from the Vale who have never so much as set eyes on  Winterfell.
4216,Barristan,Jon,Those who take the  black serve for life.So do the knights of the Kingsguard.
4217,Boros,Catelyn,"If I send the  Watch a hundred men in Jons place, Ill wager they find some way to release him from his vows."
4218,Catelyn,Robb,"A bastard cannot inherit.Not unless hes legitimized by a royal decree,There is more precedent for that than for  releasing a Sworn Brother from his oath.Precedent,Yes, Aegon the Fourth legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed."
4219,Jon,Tristifer,"Should he wed and breed, any sons you may have by Jeyne will never be safe.Jon would never harm a son of mine.No more than Theon Greyjoy would harm Bran or Rickon?"
4220,Robb,Tristifer,That is as  cruel as it is unfair.Jon is no Theon.So you pray.
4221,Arya,Sansa,. .
4222,Jon,Robb,"I had hoped you would support my choice.I cannot,In all else, Robb."
4223,Catelyn,Robb,Do not ask it.I dont have to.Im the king.
4224,Catelyn,Robin,"My lady,you seem so  somber."
4225,Dacey,Maege,"This is an evil rain,We have suffered  much, and there is more peril and more grief ahead."
4226,Catelyn,Dacey,Only an evil rain would chill our hearts  when most we need them to bum hot.
4227,Catelyn,Dacey,I would sooner have water raining down on me than arrows.
4228,Catelyn,Maege,"You are braver than I am, I fear.Are all your Bear Island women such  warriors?She-bears, aye,We have needed to be."
4229,Dacey,Maege,"The wives they left behind had to defend themselves and their children, or else be carried off.Theres a carving on our gate,A woman in a bearskin, with a child in one arm suckling at  her breast."
4230,Dacey,Maege,"Shes no proper lady, that one, but I always loved  her.My nephew Jorah brought home a proper lady once,He won her in a tourney.How she hated that carving.Aye, and all the rest,She had hair like spun gold,  that Lynesse."
4231,Catelyn,Dacey,"But her soft hands were never made for axes.Nor her teats for giving suck,"
4232,Bran,Eddard,"There was a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once,but in time she found much here she could love."
4233,Raynald,Robb,"Lady Stark, it is ever a pleasure.I bring good tidings, I hope.We are in sore need of some, my lord."
4234,Jason,Raynald,"The gods have heard our prayers, my lords."
4235,Balon,Jason,"Captain, tell them what    you told me.Aye, Your Grace."
4236,Balon,Catelyn,"My last port of call afore Seagard, that was  Lordsport on Pyke."
4237,Balon,Catelyn,"Only, well, the long and the short of it is, hes dead.Balon Greyjoy?"
4238,Balon,Catelyn,You are telling us that Balon Greyjoy is dead?
4239,Balon,Catelyn,"You know how Pykes built on a headland, and part on rocks and  islands off the shore, with bridges between?"
4240,Galbart,Greatjon,"Crabs  ate his eyes, I hear."
4241,Galbart,Greatjon,"King crabs, I hope, to sup upon such royal jelly, eh?"
4242,Galbart,Greatjon,"Aye, but thats not all of it, no!"
4243,Galbart,Greatjon,The brothers back.Victarion?
4244,Balon,Galbart,Euron.
4245,Greatjon,Jason,"And so I did, and here I am.Captain,"
4246,Greatjon,Jason,"Pray wait outside.That I will, Your Grace.That I will."
4247,Robb,Theon,"Euron Greyjoy is no mans notion of a king, if half of what Theon said of him was true."
4248,Euron,Galbart,"He has to go back.Theres a daughter as well,The one who holds Deepwood Motte, and  Robetts wife and child.If she stays at Deepwood Motte thats all she can hope to hold,Whats true for the  brothers is even more true for her.She will need to sail home to oust Euron and press her own claim."
4249,Jason,Robb,"You have a fleet at Seagard?A fleet, Your Grace?"
4250,Jason,Theon,"Enough to defend my own shores  against raiders, but I could not hope to meet the Iron Fleet in battle.Nor would I ask it of you."
4251,Jason,Theon,"My  lord, I need two of your longships to sail around the Cape of Eagles and up the Neck to Greywater  Watch."
4252,Jason,Theon,"A dozen streams drain the wetwood, all shallow, silty, and uncharted."
4253,Howland,Jason,How are my ships to find it?Go upriver flying my banner.
4254,Howland,Maege,"Lady Maege shall go on one, Galbart on the second."
4255,Howland,Maege,"Youll carry letters for those lords of mine who remain in the north, but all the  commands within will be false, in case you have the misfortune to be taken."
4256,Maege,Robb,"Back to Bear Island, or for the Stony Shore."
4257,Maege,Robb,"Moat Cailin is the key.Lord Balon knew that, which is why he sent his brother Victarion  there with the hard heart of the Greyjoy strength.Succession squabbles or no, the ironborn are not such fools as to abandon Moat Cailin,No,Victarion will leave the best part of his garrison, Id guess."
4258,Galbart,Robb,"He will need such men to speak for him if he hopes to sit the Seastone Chair.You cannot mean to attack up the causeway, Your Grace,The approaches are  too narrow."
4259,Galbart,Robb,"No one has ever taken the Moat.From the south,But if we can attack from the north and west simultaneously, and take the  ironmen in the rear while they are beating off what they think is my main thrust up the causeway, then we  have a chance."
4260,Greatjon,Robb,"Roose Bolton will have the rearguard, while I command the center."
4261,Greatjon,Robb,Your attack must  be so fierce that the ironborn have no leisure to wonder if anyone is creeping down on them from the  north.
4262,Greatjon,Robb,"Your creepers best come fast, or my men will swarm those walls and win the  Moat before you show your face.Ill make a gift of it to you when you come dawdling up.Thats a gift I should be glad to have,"
4263,Edmure,Robb,"You talk of attacking the ironmen in the rear, sire, but how do you mean to get  north of them?There are ways through the Neck that are not on any map, Uncle.Ways known only to the  crannogmen - narrow trails between the bogs, and wet roads through the reeds that only boats can  follow."
4264,Edmure,Robb,"Tell Howland Reed that he is to send guides to me, two days  after I have started up the causeway."
4265,Galbart,Greatjon,"We will fall upon the Moat from three sides on the first day of the new century, as the ironmen are  waking with hammers beating at their heads from the mead theyll quaff the night before.I like this plan,I like it well."
4266,Galbart,Greatjon,There are risks.  
4267,Catelyn,Robb,My father knew the worth of Howland Reed.
4268,Catelyn,Robb,Mother.
4269,Catelyn,Robb,Do you have some part in this for me?Your part is to stay safe.
4270,Catelyn,Robb,"You will be comfortable there, I know."
4271,Galbart,Jason,"My lady, His Grace is wise.Its best you do not come with us.Seagard will be brightened by your presence, Lady Catelyn,You would make me a prisoner,An honored guest,"
4272,Catelyn,Jason,"I mean no offense to Lord Jason,but if I cannot continue on  with you, I would sooner return to Riverrun.I left my wife at Riverrun."
4273,Balon,Robb,"After the wedding, you shall go to Seagard, that is my  royal command."
4274,Balon,Robb,One more matter.
4275,Catelyn,Rickon,I command you now as my true and loyal lords to  fix your seals to this document as witnesses to my decision.
4276,Jon,Samwell,"Old gods, hear my prayer."
4277,Gilly,Jon,Gilly has a little son.
4278,Gilly,Samwell,"How much longer, Samwellis it far, still?Not so far.Not so far as it was."
4279,Gilly,Samwell,Another few days should see us there.
4280,Gilly,Samwell,Is the Wall as big as Craster used to say?
4281,Gilly,Samwell,Bigger.
4282,Gilly,Samwell,So big you cant even see the castles hidden behind it.
4283,Gilly,Samwell,"Its so hot in there, Gilly,  youll hardly believe it.Could I stand by the fire?"
4284,Gilly,Samwell,"Not for a long time, just till were good and warm?You can stand by the fire as long as you like."
4285,Halder,Samwell,"Hot mulled wine and a  bowl of venison stewed with onions, and Hobbs bread right out of the oven, so hot it will bum your  fingers."
4286,Gilly,Halder,"Sometimes one of  the brothers will sing,Dareon sang best, but they sent him to  Eastwatch."
4287,Gilly,Halder,"He likes to sing, but he has an awful voice.Do you sing?"
4288,Gilly,Samwell,I ...
4289,Gilly,Samwell,He said if I wanted to prance around I should do it in the yard with a sword in my  hand.Could you sing some southron song?For the babe?If you like.
4290,Gilly,Samwell,"Theres a song our septon used to sing to me and my sisters,  when we were little and it was time for us to go to sleep.The Song of the Seven/ its called."
4291,Randyll,Samwell,"I will have no more of that,You ruined one boy with those soft septons songs, do you mean to do the same to this  babe?Go sing to your sisters, if you must sing."
4292,Gilly,Samwell,"That was pretty, Samwell You sing good.You should hear Dareon.His voice is sweet as mead.We drank the sweetest mead the day Craster made me a wife.It was summer then, and not so cold."
4293,Gilly,Samwell,"Did you only sing of six gods?Craster always told us you southrons had  seven.Seven,but no one sings of the Stranger."
4294,Gilly,Samwell,We should eat something.A bite or two.
4295,Gilly,Samwell,"Hes come for the babe,He smells him."
4296,Gilly,Small,Hes come for the life.
4297,Samwell,Small,"Go away,We dont want you here."
4298,Craster,Grenn,"Gilly, calm the horse and lead her out.You do that.You - I have the knife.The dragonglass dagger."
4299,Gilly,Samwell,Paul?
4300,Samwell,Scar,Small Paul.
4301,Samwell,Scar,"No one else  could have done that, but you did."
4302,Gilly,Samwell,"Dont hurt us, Paul."
4303,Gilly,Samwell,Why would you want to hurt us?
4304,Gilly,Samwell,NO!
4305,Samwell,Small,Youre dead!
4306,Samwell,Small,"Youre dead, youre dead."
4307,Lark,Samwell,Gilly?
4308,Lark,Samwell,"Gilly, I killed it."
4309,Gilly,Samwell,Its not fair...Fair.
4310,Gilly,Samwell,"Fair, far, fear."
4311,Chett,Samwell,"Go,Go, go, go."
4312,Gilly,Samwell,We have to go.But where?
4313,Gilly,Samwell,"They killed our horse, how will we...Brother!"
4314,Gilly,Samwell,"Here,"
4315,Gilly,Samwell,"Here,"
4316,Gilly,Samwell,"My  thanks,"
4317,Arya,Sandor,Is this the Blackwater Rush?
4318,Arya,Sandor,"Its a river we need to cross, thats all you need to know."
4319,Arya,Sandor,"The next time  you hit me, Ill tie your hands behind your back,The next time you try and run off, Ill bind  your feet together."
4320,Arya,Sandor,Your choice.
4321,Arya,Sandor,"Ill give you that one,But if  youre stupid enough to try again, Ill hurt you.Why dont you just kill me like you did Mycah?"
4322,Arya,Sandor,The  next time you say that name Ill beat you so bad youll wish I killed you.
4323,Arya,Beric,"The fords will all be gone,and I wouldnt care to try and swim over neither."
4324,Arya,Thoros,"Harroway town shouldnt be far,Where Lord Roote stables Old King Andahars  two-headed water horse.Maybe well ride across."
4325,Arya,Chett,"Wipe your nose and shut your mouth,"
4326,Arya,Sandor,"Lord Harroways Town,Seven hells!"
4327,Arya,Beric,What do you want?
4328,Arya,Beric,"Take us over,"
4329,Arya,Beric,It will cost you.Then Ill pay.
4330,Arya,Sandor,"Wet enough for you, ser?"
4331,Arya,Sandor,"I need your boat, not your bloody wit."
4332,Arya,Sandor,"I wouldnt,"
4333,Arya,Sandor,"We can get you across,It  will cost you a gold piece."
4334,Arya,Sandor,A third for the boy.Three dragons?
4335,Arya,Sandor,"For three dragons I should own the bloody ferry.Last year, might be you could."
4336,Arya,Sandor,"Three dragons, or you teach that  hellhorse how to walk on water.I like an honest brigand."
4337,Arya,Sandor,"Three dragons ... when you put us ashore safe on the north  bank.Ill have them now, or we dont go."
4338,Arya,Sandor,"Heres your choice.Gold on the  north bank, or steel on the south."
4339,Arya,Sandor,How do I know youre good for it?
4340,Arya,Sandor,"Knights honor,"
4341,Arya,Sandor,That will do.
4342,Arya,Sandor,"Come on then, we can have you across before dark."
4343,Arya,Sandor,Theres a brazier in the cabin if you and your son  want to get warm.Im not his stupid son!
4344,Arya,Sandor,How many times do I need to tell you to  shut your bloodymouth? 
4345,Arya,Sandor,"Get in there and get  dry, like the man said."
4346,Arya,Sandor,"Six dragons,Three for the passage, and three for the man I lost."
4347,Arya,Sandor,There.Take ten.Ten?
4348,Arya,Sandor,"Whats this, now?A dead mans note, good for nine thousand dragons or nearabouts."
4349,Arya,Sandor,"Ten of it is yours.Ill be back for the rest one day,  so see you dont go spending it."
4350,Arya,Sandor,Writing.
4351,Arya,Sandor,"Knights  honor, you said.Knights have no bloody honor.Time you learned that, old man."
4352,Arya,Meryn,"The ferry wont cross back till morning,and that lot wont be  taking paper promises from the next fools to come along."
4353,Arya,Sandor,"Seven  bloody hells,I hate fires."
4354,Arya,Sandor,"Dont even  think about it.I wasnt,"
4355,Arya,Sandor,"I never beat your sister,But Ill beat you if  you make me."
4356,Arya,Sandor,None of it will do you a bit of good.
4357,Arya,Gregor,At least you look at my face.
4358,Arya,Gregor,How do you like it?I dont.Its all burned and ugly.
4359,Arya,Gregor,Youre a little fool.
4360,Arya,Gregor,"Youd just get caught by someone worse.I would not,There is no one worse.You never knew my brother."
4361,Arya,Gregor,His own man.
4362,Arya,Sandor,I did so know your brother.
4363,Arya,Sandor,"Him  and Dunsen and Polliver, and Raff the Sweetling and the Tickler."
4364,Arya,Sandor,And how would Eddard Starks precious little daughter come to know the  likes of them?Gregor never brings his pet rats to court.I know them from the village.
4365,Arya,Sandor,"The village by  the lake where they caught Gendry, me, and Hot Pie.They caught Lommy Greenhands too, but Raff the  Sweetling killed him because his leg was hurt."
4366,Arya,Sandor,Caught you?My brother caught you?
4367,Cersei,Sandor,"Gregor never knew what he had, did he?"
4368,Arya,Cersei,"Ill be sure and tell him that, before I cut his heart out."
4369,Arya,Cersei,"But hes your brother,Didnt you ever have a brother you wanted to kill?"
4370,Arya,Cersei,Or maybe a sister?
4371,Arya,Cersei,Sansa.
4372,Arya,Cersei,"The wolf bitch wants  to kill the pretty bird.No,Id like to kill you.Because I hacked your little friend in two?"
4373,Arya,Lollys,"Your sister sang me a  sweet little song.Youre lying,You dont know half as much as you think you do."
4374,Arya,Lollys,Where do you think were going?
4375,Arya,Lollys,"Back to Kings Landing,Youre bringing me to  Joffrey and the queen."
4376,Arya,Lollys,Stupid blind little wolf bitch.
4377,Arya,Lollys,"Bugger Joffrey, bugger the queen, and bugger that twisted little gargoyle she calls a brother."
4378,Arya,Lollys,"Whats a dog to do with lions,  I ask you?"
4379,Craster,Qhorin,
4380,Arya,Chett,"Not the noble lightning  lord or that flaming fraud of a priest, the monster."
4381,Arya,Chett,You think your  outlaw friends are the only ones can smell a ransom?
4382,Chett,Jon,"Maybe Ill even kill Gregor for him, hed like that.Hell never take you,Not you.Then Ill take as much gold as I can carry, laugh in his face, and ride off."
4383,Jon,Mag,"Keep your mouth  shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding."
4384,Craster,Qhorin,"Now all we need do is follow the road, girl."
4385,Jon,Moon,"I need a  fresh mount, with saddle and bridle,"
4386,Jon,Moon,"Wake the village,Warn  them."
4387,Jon,Moon,Gather your goods and make for Castle Black.
4388,Donal,Mag,Jon Snow?None else.
4389,Jon,Mance,Your face.
4390,Jon,Qhorin,A skinchanger tried to rip out my eye.
4391,Jon,Qhorin,"Scarred or smooth, its a face I thought Id seen the last of.We heard youd gone over  to Mance Raydar."
4392,Jon,Qhorin,Who told you that?Jarman Buckwell.
4393,Jon,Qhorin,"His scouts claim they saw you with their own eyes,  riding along beside the wildling column and wearing a sheepskin cloak."
4394,Jon,Qhorin,"I see the last  parts true.Its all true,As far as it goes.Should I be pulling down a sword to gut you, then?No."
4395,Harma,Qhorin,"Noye, where is the garrison?Defending the Wall against your wildling friends.Yes, but where?Everywhere."
4396,Bowen,Jon,Next day theyre somewhere else.
4397,Bowen,Jon,"Feints.Mance wants us to spread ourselves thin, dont you see?"
4398,Bowen,Jon,The gate is here.The attack is here.
4399,Bowen,Jon,Your leg is drenched in blood.
4400,Bowen,Jon,An arrow wound...A wildling arrow.
4401,Donal,Jon,"Youre white as milk, and burning hot besides.Im taking you to  Aemon.Theres no time.There are wildlings south of the Wall, coming up from Queenscrown to open the gate.How many?"
4402,Donal,Jon,"A hundred and twenty, and well armed for wildlings."
4403,Donal,Jon,"How many men  are left here?Forty odd,The crippled and infirm, and some green boys still in training.If Marsh is gone, who did he name as castellan?"
4404,Donal,Jon,"Ser Wynton, gods preserve him."
4405,Donal,Jon,The meanest of the cripples.
4406,Chett,Jon,Wheres your wolf?
4407,Chett,Jon,Ghost.
4408,Chett,Jon,"Id hoped hed make his way back here.Im sorry, lad.Theres been no sign of him."
4409,Jon,Samwell,Glydas!
4410,Jon,Samwell,"Lay the lad down, Ill fetch the maester."
4411,Jon,Samwell,"Snow,Snow,  snow, snow."
4412,Clydas,Donal,"Jon Snow,"
4413,Donal,Jon,"Clydas, I shall need that good sharp knife of yours."
4414,Clydas,Jon,"There are wildlings coming,From the south.  Maester Aemon gave Jons crude bandage a sniff when Clydas cut it away."
4415,Aemon,Jon,"The Magnar of Therm - aaaaah, that hurts."
4416,Aemon,Jon,"Where is the Old Bear?Jon ... it grieves me to say, but Lord Commander Mormont was murdered at Crasters Keep, at the  hands of his Sworn Brothers.Bro ... our own men?"
4417,Donal,Jon,"Who was it?Who turned on him?Garth of Oldtown, Ollo Lophand, Dirk ... thieves, cowards and killers, the lot of them."
4418,Donal,Jon,Too few honest men to keep the rogues in line.
4419,Aemon,Donal,A dozen true men made it back.
4420,Aemon,Donal,We had the tale from them.
4421,Aemon,Qhorin,"Does this mean Marsh is Lord Commander, then?"
4422,Aemon,Qhorin,"For the nonce, until we can hold a choosing,Clydas, bring me the flask."
4423,Aemon,Jon,Clydas is bringing milk  of the poppy.
4424,Aemon,Jon,"I dont need - You do,This will hurt."
4425,Donal,Jon,"Be still, or Ill tie you down."
4426,Aemon,Jon,Drink this.
4427,Aemon,Jon,"The Magnars men are disciplined,  and they have bronze armor,"
4428,Aemon,Jon,"The Magnars a lord on Skagos,There were Skagossons at Eastwatch when I first came  to the Wall, I remember hearing them talk of him.Jon was using the word in its older sense, I think,not as a family name but as a  title. Jon agreed."
4429,Aemon,Mance,"The Horn of Winter, thats what he was  digging for up along the Milkwater."
4430,Aemon,Jon,"The Horn of Winter is an ancient legend.Does the  King-beyond-theWall truly believe that such a thing exists?They all do,Ygritte said they opened a hundred graves ... graves of kings and heroes, all  over the valley of the Milkwater, but they never."
4431,Donal,Jon,.Who is Ygritte?
4432,Donal,Ygritte,A woman of the free folk.
4433,Donal,Ygritte,"Shes with Styr, but shes not ... shes young, only a girl, in truth,  wild, but she..."
4434,Aemon,Ygritte,"I broke my vows with her. It was wrong.Wrong  to love her, wrong to leave her... "
4435,Craster,Qhorin,"Donal, the hot knife, if you please."
4436,Grenn,Jon,Jon?
4437,Grenn,Jon,You shouldnt move.Pyp?
4438,Grenn,Jon,I thought youd gone  .
4439,Grenn,Jon,. .
4440,Grenn,Jon,Grenns here too.Im here too.
4441,Grenn,Jon,I fell asleep.
4442,Grenn,Jon,"Water,"
4443,Grenn,Jon,"I saw the Fist,The blood, and the dead horses ... Noye said a dozen made it back ...who?Dywen did."
4444,Garth,Grenn,"Me.SamwellHe killed one of the Others, Jon."
4445,Jon,Samwell,He hated that.
4446,Grenn,Samwell,What happened to him?We left him.
4447,Grenn,Samwell,"I shook him and screamed at him, even slapped his face."
4448,Grenn,Samwell,"He wouldnt move, Jon."
4449,Grenn,Jon,"He might still be alive,He might surprise us all and come riding up tomorrow.With Mance Rayders head, aye."
4450,Grenn,Jon,Samwellthe Slayer!
4451,Aemon,Jon,"Grenn, go wake Maester Aemon,Tell him Jon needs more milk of the poppy."
4452,Aemon,Jon,"No,The Magnar...We know,The sentries on the Wall have been told to keep one eye on the south, and  Donal Noye dispatched some men to  Weatherback Ridge to watch the kingsroad.Maester Aemons sent birds to Eastwatch and the Shadow  Tower too."
4453,Aemon,Grenn,"Jon, be gentle with yourself."
4454,Grenn,Jon,. I cant.
4455,Grenn,Jon,"Mance will be here soon ... thousands of men, giants,  mammoths ... has word been sent to Winterfell?To the king?"
4456,Balon,Grenn,"He doesnt know.Jon,"
4457,Aemon,Jon,  
4458,Bran,Rickon,My brothers are at Winterfell.
4459,Bran,Rickon,.
4460,Rickon,Theon,"I am so very sorry, Jon."
4461,Grenn,Theon,"When your fathers bannermen threatened to retake  it, he put the castle to the torch.Your brothers were avenged,Boltons son killed all the ironmen, and its said hes flaying  Theon Greyjoy inch by inch for what he did.Im sorry, Jon."
4462,Jon,Theon,We are all.
4463,Bran,Grenn,"Theres some mistake,At  Queenscrown I saw a direwolf, a grey direwolf ... grey.. .it knew me."
4464,Grenn,Jon,Drink this.
4465,Catelyn,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow,"
4466,Catelyn,Robb,"Tread lightly here, Robb,Lord Walder has a thin skin and a sharp tongue, and  some of these sons of his will doubtless take after their father.You must not let yourself be provoked.I know the Freys, Mother."
4467,Catelyn,Robb,I shall be as  sweet as a septon.
4468,Catelyn,Robb,"If we are offered refreshment when we arrive, on no account  refuse."
4469,Catelyn,Robb,"If nothing is offered, ask for bread and  cheese and a cup of wine.Im more wet than hungry...Robb, listen to me."
4470,Catelyn,Robb,"I have an army to protect me, Mother, I dont need to trust in  bread and salt.But if it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots, Ill eat it  and ask for a second bowl."
4471,Edmure,Walder,"Edwyn is eldest, the pale slender man with the constipated look."
4472,Robb,Walder,"Gods, I hope Roslin doesnt take after him."
4473,Robb,Ryman,"Grey Wind, to me.To me!"
4474,Catelyn,Robb,No!
4475,Catelyn,Robb,"Grey Wind, here.Here."
4476,Robb,Walder,Is this how a Stark makes amends?
4477,Ryman,Walder,"A poor greeting  I call it, to set your wolf upon us.Is this why youve come?"
4478,Petyr,Robb,"Ive come to make my apology for the wrong I did your House, and to see my uncle wed.Petyr, take my horse.Yours is almost back to the stable.I can ride behind one of my brothers."
4479,Robb,Ryman,"You come late,The rains delayed us,I sent a bird.I do not see the woman."
4480,Catelyn,Walder,"Queen Jeyne was weary after so much travel, sers.No doubt she will be pleased to visit when times are  more settled.My grandfather will be displeased."
4481,Edwyn,Walder,"Ive told him much of the lady, and he wished to behold her with his own eyes."
4482,Edwyn,Robb,"We have chambers prepared for you in the Water Tower, Your Grace,as well as for Lord Tully and Lady Stark."
4483,Edwyn,Robb,My lord grandfather regrets that he cannot feed nor house so large a host.
4484,Edmure,Edwyn,"We have thrown up three great feast tents on the far  bank, to provide them with some shelter from the rains.Your lord father is most kind."
4485,Edmure,Edwyn,They have had a long wet ride.
4486,Edmure,Edwyn,"When shall I meet my betrothed?She waits for you within,You will forgive her if she seems shy, I know."
4487,Petyr,Ryman,But perhaps we might continue this out of the  rain?Truly.
4488,Petyr,Ryman,"If you would follow me, my  father awaits."
4489,Catelyn,Edmure,"The Late Lord Frey might have seen fit to welcome us in person,I am his liege lord as well as his son-to-be, and Robbs his king.When you are one-and-ninety, Brother, see how eager you are to go riding in the rain."
4490,Catelyn,Robb,Grey Wind.
4491,Catelyn,Robb,"Grey Wind,  with me."
4492,Lothar,Walder,"Its the sound of the water he fears,Beasts know  to avoid the river in flood.A dry kennel and a leg of mutton will see him right again,Shall I summon our  master of hounds?Hes a direwolf, not a dog,"
4493,Catelyn,Raynald,I wont take him into Lord Walders hall like this.
4494,Aegon,Robb,"You will forgive me if I do not kneel, I know.My legs no longer  work as they did, though that which hangs betweenem serves well enough, heh."
4495,Aegon,Robb,"Some would say its a poor king who crowns himself with  bronze, Your Grace.Bronze and iron are stronger than gold and silver,The old Kings of Winter wore  such a sword-crown.Small good it did them when the dragons came.Heh."
4496,Aegon,Stevron,"Sire,"
4497,Robb,Stevron,"We call him Jinglebell.Ser Stevron mentioned him, my lord."
4498,Robb,Stevron,"Well met, Aegon.Your father was a  brave man."
4499,Edmure,Walder,Save your royal breath.Youd do as well talking to a chamberpot.
4500,Edmure,Walder,"Well, Lady Catelyn, I see you have returned to us."
4501,Edmure,Walder,"I suppose you want a look at her.I would, my lord.Then youll have it."
4502,Robb,Walder,You wont see her naked till the  bedding.
4503,Robb,Walder,"Heh.Soon enough, soon enough."
4504,Robb,Walder,"Benfrey,  go fetch your sister.Be quick about it, Lord Tullys come all the way from Riverrun."
4505,Jeyne,Robb,"And wheres your  bride, Your Grace?"
4506,Jeyne,Robb,"A Westerling of the Crag, Im told, heh.I left her at Riverrun, my lord.She was too weary for more travel, as we told Ser Ryman.That makes me grievous sad."
4507,Jeyne,Robb,"Isnt  that so, my lady?"
4508,Jeyne,Robb,"Y-yes, my lord."
4509,Jeyne,Robb,"She must be fair to look on.She is most fair, my lady."
4510,Catelyn,Robb,"Fairer than my own get, heh?Elsewise  how could her face and form have made the Kings Grace forget his solemn promise."
4511,Catelyn,Robb,"No words can set that right, I know, but I have come to make  my apologies for the wrong I did your House, and to beg for your forgiveness, my lord.Apologies, heh."
4512,Pate,Walder,"Here, have a look at them."
4513,Pate,Walder,"My daughter Arwyn,Shirei, my youngest  trueborn daughter."
4514,Cersei,Walda,   one girl said.
4515,Walda,Walder,The twins are Serra and Sarra.
4516,Walda,Walder,"Heh, are you another Walda?"
4517,Robb,Walder,"Im Ser Aemon Riverss Walda, lord great grandfather."
4518,Robb,Walder,How long have you been talking?
4519,Robb,Walder,The King in the North has  no interest in base stock.
4520,Robb,Walder,"There they are, all maidens."
4521,Robb,Walder,"You  might have had any one of them.It would have been an impossible choice, my lord,Theyre all too  lovely."
4522,Robb,Walder,And they say my eyes are bad.
4523,Robb,Walder,Now what is it you  have to say?My ladies.
4524,Robb,Walder,"All men should keep their word, kings  most of all."
4525,Robb,Walder,"No words can set it right, I know, yet I come  before you to ask forgiveness, that the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again  be friends."
4526,Robb,Walder,"Good,That was very good, Your Grace."
4527,Catelyn,Walder,"It  would please an old mans heart, heh."
4528,Catelyn,Walder,"And here she is, Lord Edmure.My daughter Roslin, my most precious little blossom, heh."
4529,Catelyn,Edmure,Your Grace.
4530,Catelyn,Edmure,"Lord Edmure, I hope I am not a disappointment to you."
4531,Edmure,Roslin,"You are a delight to me,  my lady,And ever will be, I know."
4532,Edmure,Roslin,"My lord is kind,My lady is beautiful."
4533,Edmure,Roslin,"But why are you crying?For joy,I weep for joy, my lord.Enough,You may weep and whisper after youre wed, heh."
4534,Roslin,Walder,"For all, for all."
4535,Robb,Walder,"Well have music, such sweet music, and wine, heh, the red  will run, and well put some wrongs aright."
4536,Robb,Walder,"Lothar, show our guests to  their quarters.I need to see my men across the river, my lord,They shant get lost,Theyve crossed before, havent they?"
4537,Catelyn,Walder,"Lead each man across by the hand if you like, its naught to me.My lord!"
4538,Catelyn,Walder,Some food would be most welcome.We have ridden many  leagues in the rain.
4539,Robb,Walder,"Food, heh.A loaf of bread, a bite of cheese, mayhaps a  sausage.Some wine to wash it down,And salt.Bread and salt."
4540,Robb,Walder,"Of course, of course."
4541,Edmure,Robb,"My guests,My honored guests.Be    welcome beneath my roof, and at my table.We thank you for your hospitality, my lord,"
4542,Lothar,Robb,"If there is anything you require, you need only tell one of the guards."
4543,Catelyn,Walder,"We should post our own guards,"
4544,Edmure,Robb,The rain seems to be  lessening.Now that were inside.
4545,Edmure,Robb,What did you  make of Roslin?
4546,Jon,Lysa,Sweet.I believe she liked me.Why was she crying?Shes a maid on the eve of her wedding.A few tears are to be expected.
4547,Edmure,Jon,Shes prettier than I dared hope.
4548,Edmure,Jon,"I know there are  more important things, spare me the sermon, septa."
4549,Catelyn,Walder,"But she seems gentle as well as fair.Why would the old weasel refuse to let me choose unless he meant to foist off  someone hideous?Your fondness for a pretty face is well known,Perhaps Lord Walder actually  wants you to be happy with your bride."
4550,Catelyn,Walder,Or it may be that Roslin is the old mans favorite.The Lord of Riverrun is a much    better match than most of his daughters can hope for.True.
4551,Catelyn,Edmure,"Is it possible the girl is barren?Lord Walder wants his grandson to inherit Riverrun.How would it serve him to give you a barren  wife?It rids him of a daughter no one else would take.Small good that will do him.Walder Frey is a peevish man, not a stupid one.Still ... it is possible?Yes,There are illnesses a girl can  have in childhood that leave her unable to conceive.Theres no reason to believe that Lady Roslin was  so afflicted, though."
4552,Catelyn,Edmure,"The Freys have received us more kindly than I had  anticipated, if truth be told.,,  Edmure laughed.A few barbed words and some unseemly gloating."
4553,Catelyn,Edmure,I  expected the old weasel to piss in our wine and make us praise the vintage.
4554,Catelyn,Edmure,"If you will excuse me, I should change from these wet clothes.As you wish."
4555,Catelyn,Edmure,I may nap an hour.
4556,Damon,Lothar,"Lady Catelyn, I thought you would be  resting.How may I be of service?Are these your brothers?"
4557,Damon,Lothar,"Brothers half-brothers, good brothers, and nephews."
4558,Hosteen,Perwyn,"And this is Ser Leslyn Haigh and his sons, Ser Harys and Ser Donnel.Well met, sers."
4559,Lothar,Renly,"I was looking forward to seeing him again.Perwyn is away,I shall give him your regards.I know he will regret having missed  you.Surely he will return in time for Lady Roslins wedding?He had hoped to, "
4560,Catelyn,Hosteen,"you saw how the rivers ran, my lady.I did indeed,I wonder if you would be so good as to direct me to your maester?Are you unwell, my lady?"
4561,Hosteen,Lothar,"A womans complaint.Nothing to concern you, ser."
4562,Catelyn,Walder,"You should find Maester Brenett in the turret on the top, my lady."
4563,Edmure,Roslin,"Your lord brother need have no fear, Lady Catelyn.Shes small, Ill grant  you, and narrow in the hips, but her mother was the same, and Lady Bethany gave Lord Walder a child  every year.How many lived past infancy?"
4564,Roslin,Willam,Five.
4565,Olyvar,Willam,Ser Perwyn.
4566,Olyvar,Roslin,Lord Edmure will have more sons than he knows  what to do with.I am sure that will please him.
4567,Catelyn,Greatjon,"Lord Bolton,Lady Catelyn,it is a pleasure to look on you again, even in such trying  times.You are kind to say so."
4568,Robb,Wendel,"Whats happened?Lannisters on the Trident,My brother is taken again.And Lord Bolton has brought us further word of Winterfell,Ser Rodrik was not the  only good man to die.Cley Cerwyn and Leobald Tallhart were slain as well.Cley Cerwyn was only a boy,Is this true, then?All dead, and Winterfell gone?"
4569,Catelyn,Roose,"The ironmen burned both castle and winter town.Some of your people  were taken back to the Dreadfort by my son, Ramsay.Your bastard was accused of grievous crimes,Of murder, rape, and  worse.Yes,His blood is tainted, that cannot be denied."
4570,Catelyn,Ramsay,Perhaps such  service might atone in some small measure for whatever crimes his bastard blood has led him to  commit.
4571,Catelyn,Robb,Or not.
4572,Catelyn,Robb,By then I hope  to have a trueborn son by Lady Walda.
4573,Robb,Roose,Did Ramsay mention Theon Greyjoy?
4574,Robb,Roose,"Was he slain as well, or did he flee?"
4575,Robin,Wendel,My son sent this with his  letter.
4576,Greatjon,Robb,Is that ...skin?
4577,Greatjon,Robb,The skin from the little finger of Theon Greyjoys left hand.
4578,Catelyn,Robb,May I offer  you this ... small token of revenge?
4579,Catelyn,Robb,"Put it away.Please.Flaying Theon will not bring my brothers back,I want his head, not his skin.He is Balon Greyjoys only living son,and now  rightful King of the Iron Islands."
4580,Catelyn,Robb,"Lord Bolton, I hope you  are not suggesting that we free the man who killed my sons.Whoever wins the Seastone Chair will want Theon Greyjoy dead,Even in chains,  he has a better claim than any of his uncles.Hold him, I say, and demand concessions from the ironborn  as the price of his execution."
4581,Catelyn,Robb,Yes.
4582,Catelyn,Roose,Hold him secure at the Dreadfort till weve retaken the north.
4583,Catelyn,Roose,"Ser Wendel said something of Lannisters on the Trident?He did, my lady."
4584,Catelyn,Gregor,"More  fled, and the rest were taken captive."
4585,Catelyn,Robb,"is Clegane across the river, then?No."
4586,Catelyn,Robb,I left six hundred men at the ford.
4587,Catelyn,Robb,"So long as the river runs high, Ser Gregor will not cross.The last thing we need is the Mountain at our backs when we start up the causeway,You  did well, my lord.Your Grace is too kind.I suffered grievous losses on the Green Fork, and Glover and Tallhart worse at  Duskendale.Duskendale."
4588,Catelyn,Robb,"Robett Glover will answer for that when I see him, I  promise you.A folly,but Glover was heedless after he learned that Deepwood Motte had  fallen."
4589,Catelyn,Roose,How many men  have you brought my son?
4590,Catelyn,Roose,"Some five hundred horse and  three thousand foot, my lady."
4591,Robb,Roose,"I regret there are not more.It should be enough,You will have command of my rear guard, Lord Bolton."
4592,Robb,Roose,Were going home.
4593,Chett,Robb,"Keep your head down and your mouth shut,"
4594,Arya,Sandor,You have business at the Twins?
4595,Arya,Sandor,"Salt pork for the wedding feast, if it please you, ser."
4596,Arya,Sandor,Salt pork never pleases me.
4597,Arya,Sandor,How did you come by this beast?
4598,Arya,Sandor,"Mlady told me to bring him, ser,Hes a wedding gift for young Lord Tully.What lady?Who is it you serve?Old Lady Whent, ser.Does she think she can buy Harrenhal back with a horse?"
4599,Arya,Sandor,"Gods, is there any fool  like an old fool?"
4600,Arya,Sandor,"Go on with you, then.Aye, mlord."
4601,Arya,Sandor,"Ser  Donnel Haigh,Ive taken more horses off him than I can count."
4602,Arya,Sandor,"Once I near  killed him in a melee.How come he didnt know you, then?"
4603,Arya,Sandor,"Because knights are fools, and it would have been beneath him to look twice at some poxy peasant."
4604,Arya,Sandor,"Keep your eyes down and your tone respectful and say ser a  lot, and most knights will never see you."
4605,Arya,Sandor,He might have  known Stranger if hed ever seen me ride him.
4606,Arya,Sandor,"Im not going to be dragged before  your brother in chains,and Id just as soon not have to cut through his men to  get to him."
4607,Craster,Qhorin,
4608,Arya,Sandor,Your choice.
4609,Arya,Eddard,"Weve missed the wedding,but it sounds as though the feast is still going."
4610,Arya,Sandor,"Theyre not  very good,"
4611,Arya,Sandor,"Theres old deaf women in Lannisport  complaining of the din, Ill warrant.Id heard Walder Freys eyes were failing, but no one mentioned his  bloody ears."
4612,Arya,Sandor,"Salt porks no fit meat for a lords wedding feast,Got pickled pigs feet too, ser.Not for the feast, you dont."
4613,Arya,Sandor,"And Im a northman, not some milksuck southron  knight.I was told to see the steward, or the cook."
4614,Arya,Sandor,.Castles closed.The lordlings are not to be disturbed.
4615,Arya,Sandor,"You can  unload by the feast tents, there."
4616,Arya,Sandor,"Ale makes a man hungry, and old Frey  wont miss a few pigs feet."
4617,Arya,Sandor,"Ask for Sedgekins, hell know  whats to be done with you."
4618,Arya,Jeyne,"Heres to Lord  Edmure and Lady Roslin,Heres to the  Young Wolf and Queen Jeyne."
4619,Arya,Sandor,Shouldnt we stop?
4620,Arya,Sandor,Theres northmen in the tents.
4621,Arya,Sandor,I bet there are Winterfell men too.
4622,Catelyn,Sandor,"Your brother will be in the castle,Your mother too.You want them or not?Yes,What about Sedgekins?"
4623,Catelyn,Sandor,Sedgekins can bugger himself with a hot poker.
4624,Catelyn,Sandor,Its your bloody brother I want.
4625,Catelyn,Chett,Alysanne. Alysanne.The Bear and the Maiden  Fair.
4626,Walda,Walder,"At the wedding feast I hope you will  not refuse to dance with my daughters,It would please an old mans heart."
4627,Catelyn,Ryman,"Your sisters dance very well,Theyre aunts and cousins."
4628,Walda,Wendel,"Everyone thought my lord would choose Fair Walda,"
4629,Catelyn,Walda,"My lord grandfather offered Roose his brides weight in  silver as a dowry, though, so my lord of Bolton picked me."
4630,Catelyn,Walder,"I  weigh six stone more than Fair Walda, but that was the first time I was glad of it.Im Lady Bolton now  and my cousins still a maid, and shell be nineteen soon, poor thing."
4631,Robb,Walder,"Your wild beast has a taste for human  flesh, I hear, heh,Rips out throats, yes.Ill have no such creature at my Roslins  feast, amongst women and little ones, all my sweet innocents.Grey Wind is no danger to them, my lord,Not so long as I am there.You were there at my gates, were you not?"
4632,Petyr,Robb,"I heard all about that, dont think I didnt, heh.No harm was done  "
4633,Petyr,Walder,"I lost a wife the same way, falling."
4634,Petyr,Walder,Or was she just some strumpet?
4635,Catelyn,Walder,Youll not have both.
4636,Petyr,Walder,"A  bear there was, a bear, a BEAR!All black and brown and covered with hair!"
4637,Petyr,Roose,"Flowers of Spring,The Bear and the Maiden Fair"
4638,Robb,Walder,the bastard feast.
4639,Greatjon,Robb,"A few more hours and this farce is done, Mother,Black Walders been mild as a lamb  for once.And Uncle Edmure seems well content in his bride."
4640,Greatjon,Ryman,"Ser Ryman?Sire.  said Robb, Would he be at the other feast?Olyvar?"
4641,Olyvar,Ryman,No.
4642,Olyvar,Robb,Duty.I see.
4643,Robb,Ryman,"Would you care for a dance, Mother?Thank you, but no."
4644,Catelyn,Ryman,"No  doubt one of Lord Walders daughters would be pleased to partner you.Oh, no doubt."
4645,Catelyn,Ryman,Iron LancesThe Lusty Lad.
4646,Ryman,Symond,I had heard that one of your cousins was a singer.Alesander.
4647,Symon,Symond,Alyx is his sister.
4648,Robin,Ryman,Will Alesander be playing for us tonight?
4649,Robin,Ryman,Not him.Hes away.
4650,Catelyn,Edmure,"Pardons, my lady.Pardons."
4651,Danwell,Edmure,"Your Grace,"
4652,Roslin,Walder,Is it meet that we  should bed them?
4653,Catelyn,Roslin,To bed with them!
4654,Catelyn,Robb,"if you think the time is meet, Lord Walder, by all means let us bed them."
4655,Marq,Robb,"The Queen Took Off Her Sandal, the King Took Off His  Crown."
4656,Marq,Patrek,"I hear Tully men have trout  between their legs instead of cocks,Does it take a worm to make them  rise?I hear that Frey women have two gates in place of one!Aye, but both are closed and barred to little things like you!"
4657,Edmure,Walda,And a  mighty pike it is!
4658,Edmure,Walda,"Nay, Ill wager its a minnow,Bed them!"
4659,Catelyn,Greatjon,"Give this little bride to me,Look at this little thing!No  meat on her at all!"
4660,Dacey,Edwyn,"No,Im done with dancing for the  nonce."
4661,Edwyn,Wendel,Is something amiss?
4662,Catelyn,Edwyn,The Rains of Castamere
4663,Robin,Small,Robb!
4664,Catelyn,Ryman,Mercy!
4665,Catelyn,Walder,"Heh,"
4666,Bran,Catelyn,Lord Walder!
4667,Bran,Catelyn,LORD WALDER!
4668,Bran,Catelyn,"Enough,Enough, I say.You have repaid betrayal with betrayal, let it end."
4669,Bran,Catelyn,"Please,He is my son."
4670,Edmure,Walder,. 
4671,Edmure,Walder,"Only a fool would believe such blather.Dyou take me for a    fool, my lady?I take you for a father."
4672,Edmure,Robb,But let Robb  go.No. 
4673,Edmure,Robb,"Mother, no ."
4674,Edmure,Robb,Yes.
4675,Robb,Walder,"Save yourself ... if not for me, for Jeyne.Jeyne?"
4676,Robb,Walder,"Mother,Grey  Wind..."
4677,Robb,Walder,"Robb, walk out of here."
4678,Robb,Walder,And why would I let him do that?
4679,Eddard,Robb,"On my honor as a Tully,on my honor as a Stark, I will trade your boys life for  Robbs."
4680,Catelyn,Robb,"A son for a son, heh,But thats a  grandson ... and he never was much use."
4681,Catelyn,Robb,Jaime Lannister  sends his regards.
4682,Catelyn,Eddard,"Mad,shes lost her wits,Make an end,"
4683,Arya,Sandor,"The castles not closed,"
4684,Arya,Sandor,"Seven bloody buggering hells,"
4685,Arya,Syrio,"Get dovm,"
4686,Sandor,Syrio,Why did you  do that?
4687,Arya,Gendry,Dont!
4688,Chett,Gendry,You cant run for - 
4689,Arya,Chett,"Get my helm,"
4690,Arya,Chett,My brother.
4691,Arya,Chett,"Dead,Do you think theyd slaughter his men and leave him alive?"
4692,Arya,Chett,"Look.Look, damn you."
4693,Arya,Sandor,Come with me.
4694,Arya,Sandor,"We have to get away from here, and now."
4695,Arya,Sandor,"Were here,"
4696,Arya,Sandor,"Robbs just in the castle, and my mother.The gates even  open."
4697,Arya,Chett,We have to go get my mother.Stupid little bitch.
4698,Arya,Chett,"You go in  there, you wont come out.Maybe Frey will let you kiss your mothers corpse.Maybe we can save her...Maybe you can."
4699,Arya,Chett,"Stay or go, she-wolf."
4700,Craster,Qhorin,
4701,Oberyn,Sansa,"The pease are overcooked,No  matter,So is the mutton."
4702,Oberyn,Sansa,"I am sorry, my lord.Why?"
4703,Oberyn,Sansa,"The pease are not your province, Sansa.I ...I am sorry that my lord husband is displeased.Any displeasure Im feeling has naught to do with pease.I have Joffrey and my sister to displease me,  and my lord father, and three hundred bloody Dornishmen."
4704,Ellaria,Oberyn,the serpents  whore.
4705,Podrick,Sansa,"The pease suffice,They are green and round, what more can one expect of pease?Here, Ill have another serving, if it please my lady."
4706,Sansa,Tyrion,As you wish.
4707,Sansa,Tyrion,"I confess, I know little of the old gods,Perhaps someday you might enlighten me.I could even accompany you.No,You ... you are kind to offer, but ... there are no devotions, my lord."
4708,Sansa,Tyrion,You would be bored.No doubt youre right.
4709,Sansa,Tyrion,Though the sound of rustling leaves might  be a pleasant change from some septon droning on about the seven aspects of grace.
4710,Sansa,Tyrion,"I wont intrude.Dress warmly, my lady, the wind is brisk out there."
4711,Tyrion,Tywin,Whats happened?
4712,Tyrion,Tywin,"Roslin    caught a fine fat trout,Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding."
4713,Joffrey,Tyrion,Does the Lord of the Crossing imagine hes being poetic?Or is this meant to  confound us? 
4714,Joffrey,Tyrion,"The trout would be Edmure Tully, the pelts ."
4715,Joffrey,Tyrion,. Hes dead!
4716,Cersei,Tywin,"Kings are falling like leaves this autumn,It would seem our little war is winning itself.Wars do not win themselves, Tyrion,Our lord father won this  war.Nothing is won so long as we have enemies in the field,The river lords are no fools,Without the northmen they cannot hope to stand  against the combined power of Highgarden, Casterly Rock, and Dome.Surely they will choose  submission rather than destruction.Most,Riverrun remains, but so long as Walder Frey holds Edmure Tully hostage,  the Brynden dare not mount a threat."
4717,Gregor,Tyrion,"Any castle that yields to us will be spared, save one.Harrenhal?"
4718,Gregor,Tyrion,The realm is best rid of these Brave Companions.I have commanded Ser Gregor to put the castle to  the sword.
4719,Joffrey,Pycelle,"They should all be put to the sword,The Mallisters and Blackwoods and  Brackens ... all of them."
4720,Joffrey,Pycelle,I wont have any generous terms.
4721,Cersei,Pycelle,And I want Robb Starks head too.
4722,Cersei,Joffrey,"Im  going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.Sire,the lady is now your aunt by marriage.A jest."
4723,Cersei,Joffrey,"Joffrey did not mean it.Yes I did,He was a traitor, and I want his stupid head.Im going to make Sansa kiss    it.No."
4724,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Sansa is no longer yours to torment.Understand that, monster."
4725,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Youre the monster, Uncle.Am I?"
4726,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.Monsters are  dangerous beasts, and just now kings seem to be dying like flies.I could have your tongue out for saying that,Im the king."
4727,Joffrey,Tywin,"Let the dwarf make all the threats he likes, Joffrey.I  want my lord father and my uncle to see what he is."
4728,Joffrey,Tywin,Aerys also felt the need to remind men that he  was king.
4729,Cersei,Joffrey,"You could ask Ser Ilyn Payne about  that, though youll get no reply.Ser Ilyn never dared provoke Aerys the way your Imp provokes Joffrey,You heard him."
4730,Craster,Qhorin,
4731,Cersei,Joffrey,The only head that need concern you is Margaery Tyrells maidenhead.
4732,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You talk about Aerys, Grandfather, but you were scared of  him."
4733,Cersei,Tywin,"Joffrey,  apologize to your grandfather,"
4734,Cersei,Tywin,Why should I?
4735,Cersei,Tywin,"He killed Prince Rhaegar and took the crown, while your father was hiding  under Casterly Rock. "
4736,Cersei,Tywin,"A strong king acts boldly, he  doesnt just talk.Thank you for that wisdom, Your Grace,Ser Kevan, I can see the king is tired."
4737,Joffrey,Tywin,"Pycelle, perhaps some gentle potion to help His Grace sleep restfully?Dreamwine, my lord?I dont want any dreamwine,"
4738,Joffrey,Kevan,"Dreamwine will serve.Cersei, Tyrion, remain."
4739,Cersei,Tyrion,"Father, I am sorry,Joffrey has always been willful, I did warn you ."
4740,Cersei,Tyrion,. There is a long leagues worth of difference between willful and stupid.
4741,Cersei,Tyrion,"Who  told him that?Not me, I promise you,Most like it was something he heard Robert say."
4742,Cersei,Tyrion,.The part about you hiding under Casterly Rock does sound like Robert.
4743,Robert,Tywin,"Yes, I recall now,Robert often told Joffrey that a king must be bold.And what were you telling him, pray?"
4744,Robert,Tywin,You gave me to understand the boy cared nothing for his father.Why would he?
4745,Tyrion,Tywin,. It appears things needed to be said.
4746,Tyrion,Tywin,Go.
4747,Tyrion,Tywin,"Not Robert the Second,Aerys the Third.The boy is thirteen.There is time yet."
4748,Tyrion,Tywin,He requires a sharp lesson.
4749,Tyrion,Tywin,"Enough of Joffrey,Wars are won with quills and ravens,  wasnt that what  you said?"
4750,Tyrion,Tywin,"How long have you and Walder Frey been plotting this?I mislike that word,And I mislike being left in the dark.There was no reason to tell you.You had no part in this.Was Cersei told?"
4751,Tyrion,Tywin,"No one was told, save those who had a part to play."
4752,Tyrion,Tywin,"My object  was to rid us of a dangerous enemy as cheaply as I could, not to indulge your curiosity or make your  sister feel important."
4753,Tyrion,Tywin,"You have a certain cunning, Tyrion, but the plain  truth is you talk too much.That loose tongue of yours will be your undoing.You should have let Joffrey tear it out,You would do well not to tempt me,Ill hear no more of this.I have been  considering how best to appease Oberyn Martell and his entourage.Oh?Is this something Im allowed to know, or should I leave so you can discuss it with yourself?"
4754,Tyrion,Tywin,Prince Oberyns presence here is unfortunate.
4755,Jon,Lewyn,"But Oberyn has always been half-mad.Is it true he tried to raise Dome for Viserys?No one speaks of it, but yes."
4756,Doran,Tyrion,"But Robert never went to Dome thereafter, and Prince Oberyn seldom left it.Well, hes here now, with half the nobility of Dome in his tail, and he grows more impatient every day,Perhaps I should show him the brothels of Kings Landing, that might distract him."
4757,Tyrion,Tywin,Never let it be said that House Lannister  blew its trumpets and I did not respond.
4758,Tyrion,Tywin,"Very droll.Shall I have them sew you a suit of motley, and a little hat  with bells on it?If I wear it, do I have leave to say anything I want about His Grace King Joffrey?"
4759,Tyrion,Tywin,"Enough.Very well, as you ask so pleasantly.The Red Viper is not going to be pleasant, I fear ... nor will he  content himself with Ser Gregors head alone.All the more reason not to give it to him.Not to ...?"
4760,Tyrion,Tywin,I thought we were agreed that the woods were full of beasts.Lesser beasts.
4761,Tyrion,Tywin,Ser Gregor has served us well.No  other knight in the realm inspires such terror in our enemies.Oberyn knows that Gregor was the one who...
4762,Gregor,Tywin,"I mean to keep him well away for so long as the  Domishmen are in Kings Landing.And when Oberyn demands the justice hes come for?I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children,So will you,  if he asks.Ser Amory Lorch is dead,Precisely."
4763,Amory,Harren,That ought to be  sufficiently grisly to appease even Oberyn Martell.You may call that justice.
4764,Amory,Harren,It is justice.
4765,Tyrion,Tywin,"Princess Elia and the babe were  in the nursery a floor below.Well, its a tale, and Ser Amorys not like to deny it.What will you tell Oberyn when he asks who gave  Lorch his orders?Ser Amory acted on his own in the hope of winning favor from the new king.Roberts hatred for  Rhaegar was scarcely a secret."
4766,Tyrion,Tywin,"Far be it from me to question  your cunning, Father, but in your place I do believe Id have let Robert Baratheon bloody his own  hands."
4767,Robert,Tywin,"You deserve that motley, then."
4768,Elia,Robert,"Yet he saw himself as a hero, and heroes do not kill children."
4769,Eddard,Elia,"I grant you, it was  done too brutally."
4770,Eddard,Elia,By herself she was  nothing.Then why did the Mountain kill her?Because I did not tell him to spare her.
4771,Aerys,Jaime,"That,  and what Jaime himself might do."
4772,Amory,Jaime,"Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane,  only that he was huge and terrible in battle."
4773,Tyrion,Tywin,"If Lorch had half the wits the gods gave a turnip, he would have calmed her with a  few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow."
4774,Tyrion,Tywin,The blood was in him.
4775,Tyrion,Tywin,"Was it a soft silk pillow that slew Robb  Stark?It was to be an arrow, at Edmure Tullys wedding feast."
4776,Tyrion,Tywin,"He kept his  men in good order, and surrounded himself with outriders and bodyguards.So Lord Walder slew him under his own roof, at his own table?"
4777,Tyrion,Tywin,"What of Lady  Catelyn?Slain as well, Id say."
4778,Tyrion,Tywin,"Frey had intended to keep her captive, but perhaps something  went awry.So much for guest right.The blood is on Walder Freys hands, not mine.Walder Frey is a peevish old man who lives to fondle his young wife and brood over all the slights hes  suffered.I have no doubt he hatched this ugly chicken, but he would never have dared such a thing  without a promise of protection.I suppose you would have spared the boy and told Lord Frey you had no need of his allegiance?"
4779,Emmon,Tyrion,Explain to  me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
4780,Emmon,Tyrion,The price was cheap by any measure.
4781,Brynden,Tyrion,"Lancel and Daven must marry Frey girls, joy is to wed one  of Lord Walders natural sons when shes old enough, and Roose Bolton becomes Warden of the North  and takes home Arya Stark.Arya Stark?"
4782,Brynden,Tyrion,And Bolton?
4783,Jacelyn,Varys,"Arya Stark is surely dead.So was Renly, until the Blackwater.What does that mean?Perhaps Petyr succeeded where you and Varys failed."
4784,Sansa,Tyrion,"Lest you forget, it is not only Joffrey who must needs  take a maidenhead."
4785,Sansa,Tyrion,And when do you imagine Sansa will be at her most  fertile?
4786,Sansa,Tyrion,Before or after I tell her how we murdered  her mother and her brother?
4787,Salladhor,Stannis,You are  certain?
4788,Salladhor,Stannis,"I am not seeing the body, no, Your Kingliness,Yet in the city, the lions prance  and dance."
4789,Davos,Salladhor,"His lady  mother was slain as well, and thrown naked in the river."
4790,Axell,Selyse,"It was the Lords wrath that slew him,It was the hand of WhIlor!Praise the Lord of Light!"
4791,Melisandre,Stannis,Is the hand of Rhllor spotted and palsied?
4792,Melisandre,Stannis,This sounds more Walder Freys handiwork  than any gods.Rhllor chooses such instruments as he requires.
4793,Melisandre,Stannis,"His  ways are mysterious, but no man may withstand his fiery will.No man may withstand him!"
4794,Melisandre,Stannis,"Be quiet, woman.You are not at a nightfire now."
4795,Melisandre,Stannis,"The wolf leaves no heirs, the kraken too many."
4796,Melisandre,Stannis,I shall offer  pardons.
4797,Melisandre,Stannis,"Full pardons, for all those  who repent of treason and swear fealty to their rightful king."
4798,Melisandre,Stannis,.They will not.
4799,Melisandre,Stannis,"I am sorry, Your Grace."
4800,Melisandre,Stannis,More false  kings will soon rise to take up the crowns of those whove died.More?
4801,Selyse,Stannis,More usurpers?More traitors?I have seen it in the flames.
4802,Selyse,Stannis,The Lord of Light sent Melisandre to guide you to your glory.
4803,Selyse,Stannis,"Rhllors holy flames do not lie.There are lies and lies, woman.Even when these flames speak truly, they are full of tricks, it seems to  me.An ant who hears the words of a king may not comprehend what he is saying,"
4804,Aegon,Salladhor,"A sign that  proves your power!Power~I have thirteen hundred men on Dragonstone, another three hundred at  Storms End."
4805,Aegon,Salladhor,The rest of Westeros is in the hands of my foes.
4806,Aegon,Salladhor,"No prospect of plunder or glory to lure  freeriders to my cause.Lord husband,you have more men than Aegon did three hundred years ago."
4807,Baelor,Stannis,Nine mages crossed the sea to hatch Aegon the Thirds cache of  eggs.
4808,Aegon,Selyse,"The mages failed, King Baelors prayers  went unanswered, the wooden dragons burned, and Prince Aerion died screaming."
4809,Aegon,Selyse,None of these was the chosen of Rhllor.
4810,Axell,Melisandre,Only death can pay for life.The boy?
4811,Axell,Melisandre,"The boy,The boy,I was sick unto death of this wretched boy before he was even born, the king complained.His very  name is a roaring in my ears and a dark cloud upon my soul.Give the boy to me and you need never hear his name spoken again,"
4812,Axell,Davos,"Give me the boy for Rhllor,"
4813,Aegon,Axell,The kingdom shall be yours.
4814,Aegon,Axell,"On bended knee I beg you, sire."
4815,Aegon,Selyse,"Let the  false and the fickle feel your flames.Your own wife begs as well, lord husband."
4816,Aegon,Selyse,Robert and Delena defiled our bed and laid a curse upon our union.
4817,Selyse,Stannis,"Lift his shadow from my womb and I will bear you many trueborn  sons, I know it."
4818,Selyse,Stannis,"He is only one boy, born of your brothers lust and  my cousins shame.He is mine own blood.Stop clutching me, woman."
4819,Melisandre,Stannis,Perhaps Robert did curse our marriage bed.
4820,Melisandre,Stannis,"The boy was not at fault, whatever the truth."
4821,Melisandre,Stannis,The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent.
4822,Melisandre,Stannis,"From his kings blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born."
4823,Robert,Selyse,"It would be a wondrous thing to see stone come to life,And  to mount a dragon ..."
4824,Robert,Stannis,We agreed afterward that  the king had been as noble as the dragons were fearsome.
4825,Robert,Stannis,"Years later, our father told  us that Aerys had cut himself on the throne that morning, so his Hand had taken his place.It was Tywin  Lannister whod so impressed us."
4826,Davos,Stannis,"Robert took the skulls  down when he donned the crown, but he could not bear to have them destroyed.Your Grace!"
4827,Davos,Stannis,Might I speak?
4828,Davos,Stannis,"My lord of the Rainwood.Why do you think I  made you Hand, if not to speak?"
4829,Melisandre,Stannis,Say what you will.
4830,Melisandre,Stannis,"I know little of dragons and less of gods ... but the queen spoke of curses.No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, in the eyes of gods and men.There are no gods save Rhllor and the Other, whose name must not be spoken."
4831,Melisandre,Stannis,"And small men curse what they cannot understand.I am a small man,so tell me why you need this boy Edric Storm to wake your great  stone dragon, my lady."
4832,Davos,Melisandre,"Only death can pay for life, my lord.A great gift requires a great sacrifice.Where is the greatness in a baseborn child?He has kings blood in his veins.  "
4833,Davos,Stannis,"Even an onion smuggler knows two onions from three.You are short a  king, my lady."
4834,Davos,Stannis,"He has you there, my lady.Two is not three.To be sure, Your Grace."
4835,Davos,Stannis,"if Joffrey should die in  the midst of all his power, surrounded by his armies and his Kingsguard, would not that show the power  of the Lord at work?It might."
4836,Davos,Selyse,Or not.
4837,Davos,Selyse,"Joffrey shall die,It may be that he is dead already,"
4838,Axell,Stannis,"Are you trained crows, to croak at me in turns?Enough.Husband, hear me - Why?"
4839,Melisandre,Stannis,You may go.
4840,Davos,Stannis,"Why are you still here?Sire, about Edric Storm...Spare me."
4841,Davos,Stannis,"Your daughter takes her lessons with him, and plays with him every day in Aegons  Garden.I know that.Her heart would break if anything ill should -  "
4842,Davos,Robert,"My brother liked the making of children well enough, but after birth they  were a bother.He asks after you every day, he -    I will hear no more of this bastard boy.His name is Edric Storm, sire.I know his name."
4843,Davos,Edric,"Are you satisfied, my lord Hand?Edric - "
4844,Davos,Edric,My duty is to the  realm.
4845,Davos,Edric,How many boys dwell in Westeros?
4846,Melisandre,Stannis,Yet  dare I disregard her?
4847,Melisandre,Stannis,We do not choose our destinies.
4848,Aegon,Stannis,Lighthringer!
4849,Aegon,Stannis,"It  glimmers prettily,  Ill grant you, but on the Blackwater this magic sword served me no better than any common steel."
4850,Aegon,Stannis,"Do  you think we would name him Aegon the Conqueror today if he had not had dragons?Your Grace,"
4851,Aegon,Davos,I know the cost!
4852,Davos,Melisandre,Or you?
4853,Davos,Stannis,"If Joffrey should die ... what is the life of one bastard boy against a  kingdom?Everything,"
4854,Davos,Stannis,"Go,before you talk yourself back into the  dungeon."
4855,Davos,Stannis,"Aye, Your Grace."
4856,Davos,Salladhor,"If the red woman brings them to life, the castle will come crashing down, I am thinking."
4857,Davos,Salladhor,And privy shafts.
4858,Davos,Salladhor,"Does this mean you have forgiven my treachery,  Salla?"
4859,Davos,Salladhor,"Forgiving, yes."
4860,Davos,Stannis,"No, because the king made my old friend his Hand."
4861,Davos,Stannis,"This is true, yes?"
4862,Davos,Salladhor,"A certain Lysene pirate once told me that a good smuggler stays out of sight,Black sails, muffled oars, and a crew that knows how to hold their tongues."
4863,Davos,Salladhor,A crew with no tongues is even better.Big strong mutes who cannot read or  write.
4864,Davos,Edric,"But I am glad to know that someone watches your back, old  friend."
4865,Davos,Edric,one little dragon could end this great  big war.
4866,Davos,Edric,"He will not do it,He could not harm his own blood.Lord Renly will be glad to hear this.Renly was a traitor in arms."
4867,Davos,Edric,His Grace is a just man.
4868,Davos,Edric,We shall be seeing.
4869,Davos,Edric,"Even now, rascally  smugglers may be sailing across the Blackwater Bay, hoping to avoid paying their lords lawful duties."
4870,Davos,Edric,Take care.
4871,Davos,Edric,"You are grown so very great  now, yet the higher a man climbs the farther he has to fall."
4872,Davos,Pylos,"You are a notable captain,A captain  rules his ship, does he not?"
4873,Davos,Pylos,This is much the same.
4874,Davos,Pylos,It is not at all the same!
4875,Davos,Pylos,"A  kingdoms not a ship ... and a good thing, or this kingdom would be sinking."
4876,Davos,Pylos,Where do I find the wind to blow King Stannis to his  throne?
4877,Davos,Pylos,"And there you have it, my lord."
4878,Davos,Pylos,"His Grace knows what he has in you, I think.Onions,That is what he has in me."
4879,Davos,Myles,". Ser Ryam Redwyne was the greatest knight of his day, and one of the worst Hands ever to serve a  king."
4880,Maegor,Pylos,"Against  this, you have Septon Barth, the blacksmiths son the Old King plucked from the Red Keeps library,  who gave the realm forty years of peace and plenty."
4881,Maegor,Pylos,"Read your history, Lord Davos, and  you will see that your doubts are groundless.How can I read history, when I cannot read?Any man can read, my lord,There is no magic needed, nor high birth, I am  teaching the art to your son, at the kings command.Let me teach you as well."
4882,Davos,Shireen,"Under the  sea the old fish eat the young fish,"
4883,Davos,Shireen,"I know, I know, oh oh oh.Up here the young fish teach the old fish,"
4884,Devan,Pylos,"My brothers have ascended to the Hall of Light, to sit beside the Lord,I will pray for them at the nightfires, and  for you as well, Father, so you might walk in the Light of the Lord till the end of your days.Good morrow to you, Father,"
4885,Devan,Edric,beard.
4886,Edric,Stannis,"Yes, good morrow, my lord,"
4887,Davos,Edric,"Do you come from  my uncle?How fares His Grace?Well,"
4888,Pylos,Shireen,"I hope I have not disturbed your lesson.We had just finished, my lord,We were reading about King Daeron the First."
4889,Selyse,Stannis,"He went to war and conquered Dome.The Young Dragon, they called him.He worshiped false gods,but he was a great king otherwise, and very brave in battle.He was,but my father was braver."
4890,Devan,Selyse,Did Uncle Robert win three battles in a day?
4891,Devan,Pylos,It was when hed first come home to call his banners.
4892,Devan,Pylos,He slew Lord Fell in single combat and  captured his son Silveraxe.
4893,Edric,Pylos,"Is that how it happened?I said so, didnt I?"
4894,Edric,Pylos,"He smashed all three of them, and  fought so bravely that Lord Grandison and Lord Cafferen became his men afterward, and Silveraxe too.No one ever beat my father.Edric, you ought not boast,King Robert suffered defeats like any other man.Lord Tyrell bested him at Ashford, and he lost many a tourney tilt as well.He won more than he lost, though.And he killed Prince Rhaegar on the Trident.That he did,But now I must give my attention to Lord Davos, who has waited so  patiently.We will read more of King Daerons Conquest of Dome on the morrow."
4895,Davos,Pylos,"My lord, perhaps you would like to try a bit of Conquest of  Dome as well?"
4896,Davos,Pylos,"King Daeron wrote with an  elegant simplicity, and his history is rich with blood, battle, and bravery.Your son is quite engrossed.My son is not quite twelve."
4897,Davos,Pylos,"Give me another letter, if you would.As you wish, my lord."
4898,Davos,Stannis,There are no new letters.
4899,Davos,Stannis,. 
4900,Davos,Pylos,This might serve our purpose.
4901,Davos,Pylos,"To the ... five kings,The king ... be ... the king ... beware?Beyond,"
4902,Davos,Pylos,The King beyond the Wall comes ... comes south.  
4903,Davos,Pylos,  The haunted forest.
4904,Davos,Pylos,.
4905,Davos,Pylos,Yes.
4906,Davos,Pylos,"Oth ... other birds have come since, with no words."

4908,Davos,Stannis,"This is from the Nights Watch.Maester, has King Stannis  seen this letter?I brought it to Lord Alester when it first arrived."
4909,Davos,Stannis,"His Grace lacks  the men to fight his own battles, he has none to waste on wildlings/ he said to me."
4910,Davos,Stannis,"Only a starving  man begs bread from a beggar,Pardon, my lord?Something my wife said once."
4911,Pylos,Stannis,"I met some wildlings  when I was a boy,They were fair thieves but bad hagglers."
4912,Pylos,Stannis,"All in all, they seemed men like any other men, some fair, some foul.Men are men,Shall we return to our reading, my lord Hand?"
4913,Davos,Melisandre,"King Stannis never saw this letter, you are quite certain?Nor  Melisandre? No."
4914,Davos,Melisandre,"Even now?No,You did your duty when you brought it to Lord Alester."
4915,Davos,Pylos,"My lord, are you unwell?"

4921,Jon,Mag,"I can fight,Your legs healed, is it?"
4922,Jon,Mag,"You wont mind me giving it a little kick, then?Id sooner you didnt.Its stiff, but I can hobble around well enough, and stand and fight if you have  need of me.I have need of every man who knows which end of the spear to stab into the wildlings.The pointy end."
4923,Jon,Mag,"Might be youll do.Well put you on a tower with a longbow, but if  you bloody well fall off dont come crying to me."
4924,Donal,Jon,"The scarecrow sentinels,"
4925,Jon,Rodrik,"It cant,That is the point."
4926,Jeor,Jon,"Our only foes are to the north, and to the north we  have the Wall."
4927,Donal,Jon,"The castle does  them no good,Kitchens, common hall, stables, even the towers ... let  them take it all.Well empty the armory and move what stores we can to the top of the Wall, and make  our stand around the gate."
4928,Donal,Jon,"No,The pitch goes to the hoist,  the oil up the steps, crossbow bolts to the fourth, fifth, and sixth landings, spears to first and second."
4929,Eddard,Jon,"Now, you poxy plow pushers, NOW!"
4930,Eddard,Robb,"It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is, if his commands cannot  be heard,"
4931,Jon,Satin,Its cold.
4932,Jon,Satin,The Frostfangs are cold.This is a brisk autumn day.I hope I never see the Frostfangs then.
4933,Jon,Satin,In wine.
4934,Jon,Satin,"You think the scarecrow sentinels  scared them off, my lord?We can hope."
4935,Dick,Owen,"Hobb said to feed you, in case youre stuck up here awhile."
4936,Dick,Owen,"Thank him for us, Owen."

4939,Jon,Owen,",,will the wildlings come today, Lord Snow?"
4940,Jon,Owen,"Youll know if they do,Listen for the horns.Two.Two is for wildlings."
4941,Jon,Robert,You remember where to go?
4942,Jon,Robert,"Im to go to the stairs, Donal Noye says."
4943,Jon,Robert,"The third landing, one two three."
4944,Jon,Robert,"If the wildlings attack, the king will come and help us, wont he?"
4945,Jon,Robert,Maester Aemon sent him a bird.
4946,Jon,Owen,"Maester Aemon sent him a bird,"
4947,Dick,Jon,"Light the fire,and fill the kettle with oil."
4948,Jon,Satin,"Go shake Dick by the  shoulder,else hes liable to sleep through the fight.Im frightened."
4949,Jon,Satin,So are they.
4950,Dick,Satin,"Dont waste a quarrel unless you know you  have a good clean shot,We have an ample supply up  here, but ample doesnt mean inexhaustible."
4951,Dick,Satin,"Theyre made of straw, an arrow will punch through them."
4952,Jon,Theon,"The    boar can keep his tusks and the bear his claws,Theres  nothing half so mortal as a grey goose feather."
4953,Jon,Satin,I got one!
4954,Jon,Satin,"I got one in the chest.Get another,"
4955,Dick,Hobb,"This is a filler string intended to act as a buffer between chapters to help prevent characters from leaking over into the previous chapter thereby really messing up the distance metrics.,the armory."
4956,Jon,Satin,"With me,"
4957,Jon,Satin,What do we do?
4958,Jon,Satin,"We kill them,"
4959,Jon,Satin,"The oil,"
4960,Jon,Satin,"Retch later,Come."
4961,Jon,Satin,"Theyre breaking,No,theyre broken."
4962,Kegs,Satin,"Got him,"
4963,Jon,Satin,What gods do you pray to?
4964,Jon,Satin,"The Seven,Pray, then,Pray to your new gods, and Ill pray to my old ones."
4965,Eddard,Jon,"A man is never so  vulnerable in battle as when he flees,A running man is like a wounded  animal to a soldier.It gets his bloodlust up."
4966,Jon,Satin,"Fetch thf torches,"
4967,Jon,Satin,"Again,Again,Again."
4968,Jon,Satin,"Bring the torch,I need to look for someone."
4969,Jon,Ygritte,"Jon Snow,"
4970,Jon,Ygritte,Is this a proper castle now?Not just a tower?It is.
4971,Jon,Ygritte,"Good,I wanted t see one proper castle, before ... before I ."
4972,Jon,Ygritte,". Youll see a hundred castles,The battles done.Maester Aemon will see to you."
4973,Jon,Ygritte,"Youre kissed by fire, remember?"
4974,Jon,Ygritte,"Aemon will draw it out and patch you up, and well get you some milk of the poppy for the pain."
4975,Jon,Ygritte,Dyou remember that cave?
4976,Jon,Ygritte,"I told you so.Well go back to the cave,Youre not going to die, Ygritte.Youre not.Oh."
4977,Meera,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow,"
4978,Bran,Meera,"It is only another empty castle,"
4979,Hodor,Robb,Hodor.
4980,Bran,Jojen,"Theres nothing here to hurt us, Your Grace."
4981,Benjen,Bran,"We left the Nightfort two hundred  years ago,"
4982,Bran,Jojen,"We should have followed Jon,"
4983,Jojen,Jon,"We should have  found the kingsroad and gone to Castle Black.We dare not, my prince,Ive told you why.But there are wildlings."
4984,Bran,Jon,"Jojen, there were a  hundred of them.So you said."
4985,Bran,Jon,"You helped your brother, if that was him in truth, but it almost cost you  Summer.I know,"
4986,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor, hodor,"
4987,Bran,Jon,"We will stay another night,put some leagues between us and the wildlings."
4988,Bran,Meera,"Maybe we should try another castle,Maybe we could get through the gate  somewhere else.I could go scout if you wanted, Id make better time by myself."
4989,Bran,Meera,"If you go east theres Deep Lake, then Queensgate."
4990,Hodor,Meera,"All the gates are sealed except the ones at Castle Black, Eastwatch, and the  Shadow Tower.Hodor,At least I should climb to the top of the  Wall,Maybe Ill see something up there.What could you hope to see?"
4991,Jojen,Meera,"Something,"
4992,Bran,Jojen,When will she come down?
4993,Bran,Jojen,When she is ready.
4994,Hodor,Jojen,We should do  the same down here.Hodor?
4995,Hodor,Jojen,"We might find something,"
4996,Hodor,Jojen,HodorNo.
4997,Hodor,Jojen,"This seems an old place,Twice as old as Castle Black,It was the first castle on the Wall, and the  largest."
4998,Bran,Hodor,"There are ghosts here,"
4999,Hodor,Jojen,"Old ghosts, from before the Old King, even before Aegon the Dragon, seventy-nine deserters who went  south to be outlaws."
5000,Chett,Hodor,"Hed sent him back to the Wall for honors sake, but he loved him still, so he came to  share his watch."
5001,Jojen,Meera,What did you  see?
5002,Jojen,Meera,"I saw the haunted forest,Hills rising wild as far as the eye can see, covered  with trees that no axe has ever touched."
5003,Bran,Jojen,I waved at him.Did you see a way down?
5004,Bran,Jojen,No.  
5005,Craster,Qhorin, Jojen finished. his sister agreed.
5006,Bran,Jojen,There is a gate here.
5007,Bran,Nan,"And that was the fault in him,for all men must know  fear."
5008,Bran,Nan,"Some say he was a Bolton,Some say a Magnar out of Skagos, some  say Umber, Flint, or Norrey."
5009,Bran,Brandon,"He was a Stark, the brother of the man who  brought him down."
5010,Bran,Brandon,"He was a  Stark of Winterfell, and who can say?"
5011,Bran,Brandon,Mayhaps he slept in this very  bed in this very room.
5012,Bran,Hodor,"Maybe it doesnt have a bottom,HODOR!Hodorhodorhodorhodor,hodorhodorhodorhodor,"
5013,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor, dont!"
5014,Bran,Hodor,You shouldnt have done  that.
5015,Bran,Hodor,Hodor?
5016,Bran,Meera,"Maybe we shouldnt stay here,By the well?"
5017,Bran,Meera,"Or in the Nightfort?Yes,"
5018,Bran,Hodor,"It was not for murder that the gods cursed him,"
5019,Bran,Hodor,"But he slew a guest beneath his roof, and  that the gods cannot forgive.We should sleep,"
5020,Bran,Hodor,Perhaps Ill have another green dream to show us the way.
5021,Bran,Hodor,Hodor.
5022,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor hodorHODOR,"
5023,Bran,Meera,"No,  no, dont, please, DONT...Who are you?"
5024,Hodor,Meera,"Im SAM,Samwell Samwell Im Samwell let me out, you stabbed me."
5025,Hodor,Meera,. 
5026,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor hodor hodor.
5027,Bran,Hodor,"Hes a black brother,Meera, hes from the Nights  Watch.Hodor?"
5028,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor,The Nights Watch, yes."
5029,Bran,Hodor,Im a brother of the Watch.
5030,Bran,Meera,"Im a  crow, please.Let me out of this."
5031,Bran,Meera,Are you the three-eyed crow?I dont think so.
5032,Bran,Meera,"Im only Samwell Samwell  Tarly.Let me out, its hurting me."
5033,Jojen,Meera,Stop flopping around.
5034,Jojen,Meera,just lie still and Ill untangle you.Who are you?
5035,Jojen,Meera,"Gilly,For the gillyflower.Hes Samwell We never meant to scare you."
5036,Jojen,Meera,"Where did you come  from?From Crasters,Are you the one?"
5037,Bran,Jojen,"The one?He said that Samwellwasnt the one,There was someone else, he said.The one he was  sent to find.Who said?"
5038,Bran,Gilly,"Coldhands,"
5039,Bran,Meera,"He said there would be people,People in the castle."
5040,Bran,Meera,I didnt know youd throw a net on me or stab  me in the stomach.
5041,Meera,Samwell,"Am I bleeding?I cant see.It was just a poke to get you off your feet,Here, let me have a look."
5042,Bran,Samwell,"Youre wearing mail.I never got near your skin.Well, it hurt all the same,Are you really a brother of the Nights Watch?"
5043,Bran,Samwell,Only a steward.I took  care of Lord Mormonts ravens.
5044,Jojen,Meera,"I lost them at the    Fist, though."
5045,Jojen,Meera,"Its a hundred leagues long  and seven hundred feet high and I couldnt find it!Well, youve found it now,Lift your rump off the ground, I want my net back.How did you get through the Wall?"
5046,Jojen,Samwell,"Does the well lead  to an underground river, is that where you came from?"
5047,Jojen,Samwell,". Theres a gate,A hidden gate, as old as the Wall itself."
5048,Jojen,Samwell,Well find this gate at the bottom of the well?
5049,Meera,Samwell,You wont.I have to take you.Why?
5050,Meera,Samwell,If theres a gate...
5051,Meera,Samwell,Its the Black Gate.
5052,Jojen,Samwell,"Only a man of the Nights Watch can open it, he said.A Sworn Brother  who has said his words.He said."
5053,Gilly,Jojen,"This ...Coldhands?That wasnt his true name,We only called him that, Samwelland me.His hands were  cold as ice, but he saved us from the  dead men, him and his ravens, and he brought us here on his elk.His elk?"
5054,Bran,Meera,His elk?
5055,Jojen,Meera,His ravens?
5056,Hodor,Jojen,Hodor?
5057,Bran,Hodor,Was he green?
5058,Bran,Hodor,Did he have antlers?
5059,Bran,Hodor,"The elk?Coldhands,The green men ride on elks, Old Nan used to say.Sometimes they  have antlers too.He wasnt a green man."
5060,Bran,Jojen,"The wights have blue eyes, though, and they dont have tongues,  or theyve forgotten how to use them."
5061,Jojen,Meera,Hell be waiting.
5062,Gilly,Meera,  
5063,Gilly,Meera,"They came with you, why  not him?Why didnt you bring him through this Black Gate too?He ... he cant.Why not?The Wall."
5064,Bran,Gilly,He cannot pass beyond the Wall.
5065,Jojen,Samwell,"I am not the one you were told to bring,He  is.Oh."
5066,Bran,Samwell,"I dont ... Im not strong enough to carry you, I. .. Hodor can carry me."
5067,Bran,Samwell,"I ride in that, up on his back."
5068,Jojen,Samwell,"Youre Jon Snows brother.   said Jojen. Bran warned.Samwelllooked confused for a moment, but finally he said, "
5069,Bran,Samwell,Gilly too.
5070,Qhorin,Samwell,Jon  ... Jon was my brother too.
5071,Bran,Jon,   Bran said.
5072,Jon,Samwell,I bet he went to Castle Black.
5073,Meera,Samwell,"Youre certain it was Jon?You saw him?Im Meera,Summer is..."
5074,Bran,Samwell,"He wont hurt you,Thats Summer. Jon said you all had wolves."
5075,Bran,Samwell,I know Ghost.
5076,Bran,Samwell,Well go with you.All of you?
5077,Bran,Meera,Hes our prince.
5078,Bran,Samwell,Will Gilly be safe if I leave her here till I come back?
5079,Meera,Samwell,"She should be,Shes welcome to our fire.The castle is empty."
5080,Bran,Gilly,"Craster used to tell us tales of castles, but I never knew theyd be so big."
5081,Bran,Gilly,"Youll come back for me,As soon as I can,then well go somewhere warm."
5082,Bran,Samwell,"Ill go first, I know the way."
5083,Jojen,Samwell,"Theres just so many steps,"
5084,Bran,Jojen,Should we have brought  torches?
5085,Bran,Jojen,"Your eyes will adjust,Keep one hand on the wall and you wont fall."
5086,Bran,Samwell,"Hodor, Hodorhodorhodorhodorhodorhodor,"
5087,Jojen,Samwell,"Who are you?Who-who-who-who-who-whowho.I am the sword in the darkness,I am the watcher on the walls."
5088,Jojen,Samwell,"I am the shield that  guards the realms of men.Then pass,"
5089,Chett,Daario,"The harpy is a craven thing,She has a womans heart and a  chickens legs.Small wonder her sons hide behind their walls."
5090,Aggo,Jhogo,"Blood of my  blood,"
5091,Aggo,Jhogo,"Ignore him, he will  soon be gone."
5092,Arstan,Jorah,"That was wisely done,Let the fool ride  back and forth and shout until his horse goes lame.He does us no harm.He does,Wars are not won with swords and spears alone, ser."
5093,Daenerys,Jorah,This hero    builds courage in the hearts of his own men and plants the seeds of doubt in ours.
5094,Daenerys,Jorah,"And if our champion were to lose, what sort of seed would that plant?A man who fears battle wins no victories, ser.Were not speaking of battle."
5095,Daenerys,Jorah,"Why risk a life for naught?For honor, I would say.I have heard enough."
5096,Daario,Daenerys,"I will see them,I will  see every one, and count them, and look upon their faces.And I will remember."
5097,Daenerys,Scar,"His name is Oznak zo Pahl,"
5098,Oznak,Scar,"I was bodyguard to his uncle once, before I joined the  Second Sons."
5099,Oznak,Scar,"But his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard, so I had to  run like a rat before he killed me too."
5100,Daario,Daenerys,"Shall I cut that  off for you and stuff it down his mouth, Your Grace?"
5101,Daario,Daenerys,"Its his city I want, not his meager manhood."
5102,Arstan,Daenerys,"This challenge must be met,It will be."
5103,Arstan,Daenerys,Tell Strong Belwas I have need of him.
5104,Belwas,Oznak,"Find liver and onions, Whitebeard,Not for now, for after.Killing makes Strong Belwas hungry."
5105,Oznak,Rakharo,"Why that one, Khaleesi?"
5106,Jorah,Rakharo,"He is fat and stupid.Strong Belwas was a slave here in the fighting pits.If this highborn Oznak should fall to such the Great  Masters will be shamed, while if he wins ... well, it is a poor victory for one so noble, one that Meereen  can  take no pride in."
5107,Arstan,Oznak,"A chivalrous man would dismount,"
5108,Daenerys,Jorah,"We should have given him chainmail,Mail would only slow him,They wear no armor in the fighting pits.Its blood the  crowds come to see."
5109,Daenerys,Jorah,What is he doing?
5110,Daenerys,Jorah,"Giving the mob a show,"
5111,Jorah,Oznak,"The lance is too long,All Belwas needs do is avoid the point.Instead of trying to spit him so prettily, the fool should ride  right over him."
5112,Daario,Jorah,"So much for the hero of Meereen,A victory without meaning,We will not win Meereen by killing its defenders one  at a time.No,but Im pleased we killed this one."
5113,Daenerys,Drogo,"Well  done,A sweet fruit for a  sweet fight."
5114,Daenerys,Drogo,"We would braid your hair and hang a  bell in it, Strong Belwas,but you have no hair to braid.Strong Belwas needs no tinkly bells."
5115,Daenerys,Drogo,"Strong Belwas needs liver and onions.You shall have it,Strong Belwas is hurt."
5116,Daenerys,Drogo,"It is nothing.I let each man cut me once, before I kill him."
5117,Daenerys,Drogo,Count the cuts  and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain.
5118,Irri,Jhiqui,"I must have this city,"
5119,Daario,Jhiqui,"Her granaries are full to bursting.There are flgs and dates and olives  growing on the terraces of her pyramids, and casks of salt fish and smoked meat buried in her cellars.And fat chests of gold, silver, and gemstones as well,Let us not forget the  gemstones.Ive had a look at the landward walls, and I see no point of weakness,Given time, we might be able to mine beneath a tower and make a breach, but what do we eat while  were digging?Our stores are all but exhausted.No weakness in the landward walls?"
5120,Jorah,Skahaz,"Does that mean we might attack from the river or the sea? With three ships?Well want to have Captain Groleo take a good look at the wall along the river, but  unless its crumbling thats just a wetter way to die.What if we were to build siege towers?My brother Viserys told tales of such, I know they can be  made.From wood, Your Grace,The slavers have burnt every tree within twenty leagues of  here."
5121,Daario,Grey Worm,. Did you see them bronze heads above the gates?
5122,Daario,Grey Worm,"Rows of harpy heads  with open mouths?The Meereenese can squirt boiling oil out them mouths, and cook your axemen where  they stand."
5123,Daario,Grey Worm,"Perhaps the Unsullied should wield the axes.Boiling oil feels  like no more than a warm bath to you, I have heard.This is false."
5124,Daario,Grey Worm,"These ones do not feel burns as men do, yet such  oil blinds and kills."
5125,Daario,Grey Worm,"Give these ones rams, and we will batter  down these gates or die in the attempt.You would die,"
5126,Daenerys,Jorah,"Though I will not say I fought bravely in all of them.There are old  sellswords and bold sellswords, but no old bold sellswords."
5127,Daenerys,Jorah,"I will not throw away Unsullied lives, Grey Worm.Perhaps we can starve the city out."
5128,Daenerys,Jorah,"Well starve long before they do, Your Grace."
5129,Daenerys,Skahaz,"The slaves are weak  from the march.Freedmen,They are slaves no longer.Slave or free, they are hungry and theyll soon be sick."
5130,Daenerys,Skahaz,"Your three ships are not enough to deny them access to both the river and  the sea.Then what do you advise, Ser Jorah?You will not like it.I would hear it all the same.As you wish."
5131,Daenerys,Skahaz,Your war is in  Westeros.I have not forgotten Westeros.
5132,Daenerys,Jhogo,"If I let Meereens old brick walls defeat me so easily, though, how will I ever take the great stone castles  of Westeros?As Aegon did,"
5133,Daenerys,Jhogo,Leave Meereen to the Meereenese and march west for Pentos.Defeated?
5134,Daenerys,Jhogo,"When cowards hide behind great walls, it is they who are defeated, Khaleesi,"
5135,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Blood of my blood,when cowards hide and burn the  food and fodder, great khals must seek for braver foes. Jhiqui agreed, as she poured."
5136,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ser Jorah, you say we have no food left.If I march west,  how can I feed my freedmen?You cant."
5137,Daenerys,Jorah,We need to put this scorched earth well  behind us.
5138,Daenerys,Jorah,"No,I will not march my people off to die."
5139,Daenerys,Jorah,There must be  some way into this city.I know a way.
5140,Daenerys,Jorah,"Sewers.Sewers?What do you mean?Great brick sewers empty into the Skahazadhan, carrying the citys wastes."
5141,Daenerys,Jorah,"That was how I escaped Meereen, after Scarb lost his head."
5142,Daenerys,Jorah,The smell  has never left me.I dream of it some nights.
5143,Daenerys,Jorah,"Easier to go out than in, it would seem to me."
5144,Big,Jorah,"That would mean the mouths are right below the walls.And closed with iron grates,"
5145,Big,Daario,Nasty.
5146,Aggo,Daario,"As nasty as you, when you came crawling out?If any man were fool enough to  try this, every slaver in Meereen would smell them the moment they emerged."
5147,Aggo,Jhogo,"Her Grace asked if there was a way in, so I told her ... but Ben Plumm isnt going  down in them sewers again, not for all the gold in the Seven Kingdoms.If theres others want to try it,  though, theyre welcome."
5148,Daenerys,Grey Worm,These sewers do not sound promising.
5149,Daenerys,Grey Worm,I must think on this some  more.Return to your duties.
5150,Chett,Daenerys,"He likes you, Ben And well he might."
5151,Chett,Daenerys,"I have me a drop of the dragon blood myself, you know.You?"
5152,Chett,Daenerys,"How could that be?Well,"
5153,Chett,Daenerys,He lived in King Aegons day.Which King Aegon?
5154,Chett,Daenerys,Five Aegons have ruled in Westeros.
5155,Chett,Daenerys,"Five, were there?"
5156,Chett,Daenerys,"The thing was,  begging your royal pardon, he had himself a cock six foot long."
5157,Chett,Daenerys,"You mean inches, I think.Feet,If it was inches, whod want to talk about it, now?Your Grace."
5158,Daario,Daenerys,Did your grandmother claim shed actually seen this prodigy?That the old crone never did.
5159,Daario,Daenerys,"Some Dothraki killed him before I was born.And where did your grandfathers knowledge come from?One of them tales told at the teat, Id guess."
5160,Daario,Daenerys,"Thats all I know about Aegon the  Unnumbered or old Lord Plumms mighty manhood, I fear.I best see to my Sons.Go do that,"
5161,Daario,Daenerys,"If you were grown,Id fly you over the walls and melt that harpy down to slag."
5162,Belwas,Daario,"Missandei,have my silver saddled."
5163,Belwas,Daario,As Your Grace commands.Shall I summon your bloodriders to guard you?Well take Arstan.I do not mean to leave the camps.
5164,Daenerys,Jorah,"Mother,"
5165,Daenerys,Missandei,"Not so hard,"
5166,Daenerys,Missandei,"Theres the treacherous sow,I knew youd come to get your feet kissed one day."
5167,Daenerys,Missandei,Im  going to start by cutting off your teats.
5168,Arstan,Mero,Whos next?I am.
5169,Arstan,Daenerys,"Grandfather,run off before I break your stick in two and bugger you with - "
5170,Arstan,Daenerys,Your Grace.
5171,Arstan,Daenerys,"I am an old man, and shamed."
5172,Arstan,Daenerys,I did not know him without his beard and hair.No more than I did.
5173,Daenerys,Jorah,Take me  back to my tent.Please.
5174,Daenerys,Jorah,"I had a  look at the river wall,Its a few feet higher than the others, and just as strong.  She cut him off."
5175,Jorah,Mero,"I saw no need to frighten you, Your Grace.  "
5176,Jorah,Mero,Arstan killed him.
5177,Jorah,Mero,"A squire with a stick slew Mero of Braavos, is that the way of  it?A stick,but no longer a squire."
5178,Arstan,Jorah,The Titans Bastard was a nasty piece of work.
5179,Arstan,Daenerys,"Who  are you, old man?A better knight than you, ser,"
5180,Arstan,Daenerys,"You said you were a squire.I was, Your Grace."
5181,Arstan,Daenerys,"I squired for Lord Swann in my youth, and at Magister  Illyrios behest I have served Strong Belwas as well."
5182,Belwas,Daenerys,"Yet there are truths I have withheld, and for that and all my  other sins I can only beg your forgiveness.What truths have you withheld?"
5183,Belwas,Daenerys,You will tell me.Now.
5184,Belwas,Daenerys,"At Qarth, when you asked my name, I said I was called Arstan."
5185,Belwas,Jorah,But it is not my true name.
5186,Daenerys,Jorah,"Mero shaved his beard, but you grew one, didnt you?"
5187,Daenerys,Jorah,. You know him?
5188,Daenerys,Jorah,"I saw him perhaps a dozen times ... from afar most often, standing with his brothers or riding in some  tourney.But every man in the Seven Kingdoms knew Barristan the Bold."
5189,Daenerys,Viserys,"Khaleesi, before you kneels Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the  Kingsguard, who betrayed your House to serve the Usurper Robert Baratheon."
5190,Daenerys,Viserys,"The crow calls the raven black, and you speak of betrayal.Why are you here?"
5191,Daenerys,Viserys,"If Robert sent you to kill me, why did you save my life?"
5192,Barristan,Viserys,"I want the whole truth now, on your honor  as a knight.Are you the Usurpers man, or mine?Yours, if you will have me."
5193,Barristan,Viserys,"I took Roberts pardon, aye."
5194,Daenerys,Jorah,   Ser Jorah said darkly. said Daenerys. Ser Barristan said.
5195,Barristan,Robert,"You were on the other side of that battle,  Mormont, were you not?"
5196,Barristan,Robert,"Your Grace, I am sorry I misled you."
5197,Daenerys,Jorah,"And since the day you wed Khal Drogo, there has been an informer by  your side selling your secrets, trading whispers to the Spider for gold and promises.You are mistaken."
5198,Daenerys,Jorah,Tell him hes mistaken.
5199,Daenerys,Jorah,.
5200,Daenerys,Jorah,"Tell him, Jorah.Tell him how he got it wrong.The Others take you, Selmy."
5201,Daenerys,Jorah,"Khaleesi, it was only at the  start, before I came to know you ... before I came to love."
5202,Daenerys,Jorah,. Do not say that word!
5203,Drogo,Jorah,How could you?
5204,Drogo,Jorah,"Gold, was it gold?"
5205,Drogo,Jorah,Tell me what you were promised?Varys said ...I might go home.
5206,Barristan,Drogo,Are all the knights of Westeros so false as you two?
5207,Barristan,Daenerys,Go!
5208,Daenerys,Drogo,"Where shall we go, Your  Grace?To hell, to serve King Robert."
5209,Daenerys,Drogo,The Others can have you both.
5210,Drogo,Tyrion,You go...
5211,Sansa,Tyrion,You go ... go...
5212,Shae,Tyrion,I thought mlord had forgotten me.
5213,Shae,Tyrion,Come out of there.I wont.
5214,Shae,Tyrion,"MIord will pluck me from the dragons jaws, I know."
5215,Chett,Shae,Shae .
5216,Chett,Shae,. 
5217,Shae,Tyrion,You have to catch me.
5218,Shae,Tyrion,MIord must have played monsters and maidens  when he was little.Are you calling me a monster?No more than Im a maiden.
5219,Chett,Tyrion,You need to catch  me all the same.
5220,Tanda,Tyrion,"My giant,My giants come to save me."
5221,Lollys,Tanda,"We should go back,It must be near dawn.Sansa will be  waking.You should give her dreamwine,like Lady Tanda does with Lollys."
5222,Lollys,Tanda,"Maybe we should,  some night.Would mlord like that? "
5223,Lollys,Tyrion,Your neck is hard as stone.What troubles you?
5224,Petyr,Pycelle,My  wife.
5225,Petyr,Pycelle,The Tyrells.
5226,Petyr,Pycelle,Varys.
5227,Petyr,Pycelle,The Red Viper of Dome.
5228,Petyr,Shae,The face that stares back out of  the water when I wash.A brave face.
5229,Petyr,Shae,I wish I could see it now.
5230,Shae,Tyrion,Better you than me.
5231,Shae,Tyrion,"We have a long day  before us, both of us."
5232,Shae,Tyrion,How are we to find our clothing?
5233,Shae,Tyrion,Maybe well have to go naked.
5234,Tyrion,Varys,"I gave Shae a false history, but it was meant for Lollys and Lady Tanda."
5235,Tyrion,Varys,  
5236,Tyrion,Varys,I will not lie to  the queen.You have lied to her before.Shall I tell her that?
5237,Tyrion,Varys,"That cuts more deeply than a knife, my lord."
5238,Tyrion,Varys,"With those whisperings I must buy my life anew each day.Pardon me if I do not weep for you.I shall, but you must pardon me if I do not weep for Shae.I confess, I do not understand what there is  in her to make a clever man like you act such a fool.You might, if you were not a eunuch.Is that the way of it?A man may have wits, or a bit of meat between his legs, but not both?"
5239,Tyrion,Varys,"Perhaps I should be grateful I was cut, then."
5240,Craster,Qhorin,"Mlord, where are you?"
5241,Shae,Tyrion,"I have found a shoe, but I believe its yours.Mlord sounds very solemn.Have I displeased you?No,You always please me."
5242,Joffrey,Shae,Day comes too soon.
5243,Joffrey,Shae,Ill go up first.Brella  will want help with the bathwater.
5244,Shae,Tallad,My giant of  Lannister.I love you so.
5245,Cersei,Sansa,"Come see,Theres a castle  in the sky."
5246,Sansa,Shae,Its made of gold.
5247,Brella,Sansa,"A castle all of gold, theres a  sight Id like to see.A castle, is it?"
5248,Brella,Sansa,"That towers tumbling over, looks like.Its all ruins, that is."
5249,Craster,Qhorin,We are expected at the queens breakfast. said Brella. Shae declared.
5250,Brella,Sansa,"Lady Sansa, youll be wanting to get into the tub before the water gets too cool."
5251,Sansa,Shae,"You are trembling, mlady.The water is not hot enough,"
5252,Podrick,Tyrion,"You look lovely, Sansa."
5253,Podrick,Sansa,"Pod, be so good as to pour me a cup of wine.There will be wine at the breakfast, my lord,Theres wine here."
5254,Podrick,Sansa,The three hundredth year since Aegons Conquest.
5255,Podrick,Sansa,To Aegon.
5256,Podrick,Sansa,"Two sisters, two wives, and three big dragons, what  more could a man ask for?"
5257,Sansa,Tyrion,"Will you  be changing into fresh garb, my lord?Your new doublet is very handsome.The doublet is handsome, yes."
5258,Sansa,Tyrion,"Come, Pod, let us see if we can find some  garments to make me look less dwarfish.I would not want to shame my lady wife."
5259,Ilyn,Tyrion,"Are purple, gold, and white the colors of House Payne, Podrick?"
5260,Ilyn,Tyrion,"No.I mean, yes."
5261,Sansa,Tyrion,The colors.
5262,Sansa,Tyrion,Both.
5263,Sansa,Tyrion,"Theres a tale behind those coins,No doubt Pod will confide it to your toes one day."
5264,Sansa,Tyrion,Shall we?
5265,Dontos,Tyrion,"Nothing like a hearty breakfast to whet ones appetite  for the seventy-seven-course feast to follow,"
5266,Margaery,Sansa,"It is the cloak I donned when Robert took me for his queen,  the same  cloak my mother Lady Joanna wore when wed to my lord father."
5267,Joffrey,Paxter,"If it please Your Grace, she will be called King    Joffreys Valor,I will make it my flagship  when I sail to Dragonstone to kill my traitor uncle Stannis,"
5268,Joffrey,Sansa,"And what is this, Uncle?"
5269,Joffrey,Kevan,"Grand Maester Kaeths history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon  the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good,A book every king should read, Your Grace,My father had no time for books."
5270,Joffrey,Kevan,"If you read less, Uncle  Imp, perhaps Lady Sansa would have a baby in her belly by now."
5271,Sansa,Tyrion,"Dont be sad, Sansa, once Ive gotten Queen Margaery with child Ill  visit your bedchamber and show my little uncle how its done."
5272,Mace,Sansa,"Seven faces for Your Graces seven  kingdoms,"
5273,Joffrey,Sansa,"A splendid cup,but well need to chip the wolf off and put a squid in its place, I think."
5274,Joffrey,Sansa,"Margaery and I shall drink deep at the feast, good father."
5275,Joffrey,Tyrion,"The damned things as tall as I am,Half a chalice and Joffrey will be  falling down drunk."
5276,Mathis,Rowan,"Magnificent,A sword to sing of, sire,A kings sword,"
5277,Arya,Sansa,"A great sword must have a great name, my lords!What shall I call it?"
5278,Balon,Joffrey,Widows Wail!
5279,Balon,Joffrey,"Yes!It shall make many a widow, too!"
5280,Balon,Joffrey,And when I  face my uncle Stannis it will break his magic sword clean in two.
5281,Addam,Balon,"Have a care, Your Grace,Valyrian steel is perilously sharp.I remember."
5282,Sansa,Tyrion,"Sharp!I told you, I am no stranger to  Valyrian steel."
5283,Joffrey,Osmund,"I pray you never turn that wicked edge on me, sire.See that you never give me cause, ser."
5284,Garlan,Joffrey,"Your Grace,Perhaps you did not know.In all of Westeros there were but four  copies of that book illuminated in Kaeths own hand.Now there are three."
5285,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You and Lady Sansa owe  me a better present, Uncle Imp.This one is all chopped to pieces."
5286,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Perhaps a knife, sire."
5287,Joffrey,Tyrion,"A dagger of the same fine Valyrian steel ... with a dragonbone hilt, say?"
5288,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You ... yes, a dagger to match my sword, good."
5289,Joffrey,Tyrion,"A ... a gold  hilt with rubies in it.Dragonbone is too plain.As you wish, Your Grace. "
5290,Ellaria,Sansa,"She was almost a whore when he found her,  mlady,and now shes near a princess."
5291,Oberyn,Tyrion,"I once had the great good fortune to see the Citadels copy of Lives of Four Kings,The illuminations were wondrous to behold, but Kaeth was too kind by half to  King Viserys."
5292,Tyrion,Viserys,Too kind?
5293,Tyrion,Viserys,It should have been  Lives of Five Kings.
5294,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Viserys hardly reigned a fortnight.He reigned more than a year,"
5295,Oberyn,Tyrion,"A year or a fortnight, what does it matter?He poisoned his own nephew to gain  the throne and then did nothing once he had it.Baelor starved himself to death, fasting,His uncle served him loyally as Hand, as he had  served the Young Dragon before him.Viserys might only have reigned a year, but he ruled for fifteen,  while Daeron warred and Baelor prayed."
5296,Sansa,Tyrion,"And if he did remove his nephew, can  you blame him?Someone had to save the realm from Baelors follies."
5297,Sansa,Tyrion,But Baelor the Blessed was a great king.
5298,Ellaria,Oberyn,The vipers refused to strike him because he was so pure and holy.
5299,Ellaria,Oberyn,"If you were a viper, my lady, would you want to bite a bloodless stick like  Baelor the Blessed?   said the woman Ellaria Sand. said Tyrion, Iiand the Seven Kingdoms might  have been better served. said Prince Oberyn, So how do you account  for Joffrey?I prefer not to."
5300,Sansa,Tyrion,If you will excuse us.Our litter awaits.
5301,Sansa,Tyrion,"Close the curtains, my lady, if youd be so  good.Must we, my lord? "
5302,Sansa,Tyrion,The day is so lovely.The good people of Kings Landing are like to throw dung at the litter if they see me inside it.
5303,Sansa,Tyrion,Close the curtains. 
5304,Sansa,Tyrion,"I was sorry  about your book, my lord,It was Joffreys book.He might have learned a thing or two if hed read it."
5305,Sansa,Tyrion,I  should have known better.
5306,Sansa,Tyrion,a good many things.Perhaps the dagger will please him more.
5307,Sansa,Tyrion,"The boys earned himself a dagger, wouldnt    you say?"
5308,Sansa,Tyrion,"Joffrey quarreled with your brother Robb at  Winterfell.Tell me, was there ill feeling between Bran and His Grace as well?Bran?"
5309,Sansa,Tyrion,"Before he fell, you mean?"
5310,Sansa,Tyrion,Bran was a sweet boy.
5311,Sansa,Tyrion,"He and Tornmen fought with wooden swords,  I remember, but just for play."
5312,Sansa,Tyrion,"You loved your brothers, much as I love Jaime."
5313,Bran,Tyrion,"My brothers were traitors, and theyve gone to  traitors graves.It is treason to love a traitor. "
5314,Bran,Tyrion,Robb rose in arms against his rightful king.
5315,Bran,Tyrion,The others died too young to know what treason was.
5316,Bran,Tyrion,"Sansa, do you know what  happened to Bran at Winterfell?Bran fell."
5317,Bran,Tyrion,"And Theon  Greyjoy killed him, but that was later.Theon Grey-joy."
5318,Bran,Tyrion,"Your lady mother once accused me ... well, I will not burden you  with the ugly details."
5319,Bran,Tyrion,And I mean no harm to  you.
5320,Bran,Sansa,"That is good to know, my lord."
5321,Sansa,Tyrion,"You have never asked me how Robb died, or your lady mother.I ... would sooner not know.It would give me bad dreams.Then I will say no more.That ... thats kind of you.Oh, yes,I am the very soul of kindness.And I know about bad dreams."
5322,Joffrey,Loras,With this kiss I pledge my love! 
5323,Sansa,Tyrion,My lady.
5324,Sansa,Tyrion,"I feared wed never escape,"
5325,Sansa,Tyrion,"I ... yes, my lord.As you say."
5326,Sansa,Tyrion,"it was  such a beautiful ceremony, though."
5327,Joffrey,Tyrion,"It was long, Ill say that much.I need to return to the castle for a good piss."
5328,Joffrey,Margaery,Would  that Id contrived some mission to take me out of the city.Petyr was the clever one.
5329,Joffrey,Sansa,"I had been thinking that when the roads are safe again, we might journey to Casterly Rock."
5330,Joffrey,Tyrion,"It would please me to show you the Golden Gallery  and the Lions Mouth, and the Hall of Heroes where Jaime and I played as boys."
5331,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I  shall go wherever my lord husband wishes.I had hoped it might please you, my lady.It will please me to please my lord."
5332,Joffrey,Tyrion,"No, it was a foolish  notion.Only a Lannister can love the Rock.Yes, my lord.As you wish."
5333,Joffrey,Margaery,"We will be expected at  the feast an hour hence, my lady.I will join you shortly."
5334,Podrick,Sansa,I laid out your new doublet.
5335,Sansa,Shae,"in the bedchamber.Yes, thats where we keep the bed."
5336,Shae,Tyrion,"Wine, Pod."
5337,Mace,Tywin,My lord?
5338,Tyrion,Tywin,Will you be changing?
5339,Tyrion,Tywin,For the  feast.Feast?
5340,Shae,Tyrion,What feast?The wedding feast.
5341,Shae,Tyrion,"King Joffrey and Lady Margaery.Queen  Margaery, I mean."
5342,Sansa,Shae,"Very well, young Podrick, let us go make me festive."
5343,Sansa,Shae,"Lady Sansa,you shall be the  most beautiful woman in the hall tonight.My lord is too kind.My lady,Couldnt I come serve at table?I so want to see the pigeons fly out of  the pie."
5344,Sansa,Tyrion,The queen has chosen all the servers.And the hall will be too crowded.
5345,Sansa,Tyrion,"There will be musicians  strolling all through the castle, though, and tables in the outer ward with food and drink for all."
5346,Sansa,Tyrion,"Come, Pod,    help me into this."
5347,Olenna,Sansa,"You do look quite exquisite, child,The wind has been at your hair, though."
5348,Olenna,Sansa,"I was very sorry to hear about your losses,Your brother was a terrible traitor, I know, but if we start killing men at  weddings theyll be even more frightened of marriage than they are presently.There, thats better."
5349,Olenna,Sansa,I am pleased to say I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day after next.
5350,Olenna,Tyrion,"Your  company would be such sweet solace.You are too kind, my lady,but my place is with my lord husband."
5351,Olenna,Tyrion,Oh?
5352,Olenna,Tyrion,I assumed you would be off leading a Lannister host against some wicked  foe.A host of dragons and stags.The master of coin must remain at court to see that all the armies are paid  for.To be sure.
5353,Olenna,Tyrion,"No doubt collecting those is such a dreadful chore.I leave the collecting to others, my lady.Oh, do you?"
5354,Sansa,Tyrion,Can we?Gods forbid.
5355,Sansa,Tyrion,"If you will excuse us, Lady Olenna, it is time we were in our places.Myself as well."
5356,Sansa,Tyrion,"I shant  eat more than three or four bites myself, but you and I are very little, arent we?"
5357,Sansa,Tyrion,Come help me to the dais.
5358,Joffrey,Tyrion,Let the cups be filled!
5359,Margaery,Tyrion,To my wife the queen!Margaery!
5360,Margaery,Tyrion,Margaery!
5361,Margaery,Tyrion,To the queen!
5362,Sansa,Tyrion,"Not to your liking, my lady?"
5363,Sansa,Tyrion,"Theres to be so much, my lord.I have a little tummy."
5364,Renly,Sansa,"for the ears of gods and men, a  song neer heard before in all the Seven Kingdoms.Lord Renlys Ride."
5365,Renly,Symon,"From his  throne of bones the Lord of Death looked down on the murdered lord,"
5366,Margaery,Renly,"Renly Baratheon never repented of anything in his life,but if  Im any judge, Hamish just won himself a gilded lute."
5367,Renly,Tyrion,"A Rose of GoldThe Rains of CastamereMaiden, Mother, and CroneMy Lady Wife"
5368,Symon,Tyrion,"The Dance of the  Dragons,"
5369,Tyrion,Tywin,Bessa the BarmaidThe Rains of Castamere.
5370,Sansa,Tyrion,So which did you prefer? 
5371,Sansa,Tyrion,My lord?The singers.Which did you prefer?
5372,Sansa,Tyrion,I was not listening.
5373,Sansa,Tyrion,"Sansa, is aught amiss?"
5374,Dontos,Moon,"No, my lord."
5375,Dontos,Tyrion,"Not swan again,"
5376,Chett,Tyrion,"To sing for the golden lute,we give you Galyeon of Cuy."
5377,Leo,Tyrion,"Noble    lords and ladies fair, I sing but one song for you this night,It is the song of the  Blackwater, and how a realm was saved."
5378,Leo,Tyrion,"The dark lord broodedhigh in his tower,in a castle as black as the night.Black was his hair and black was his soul,"
5379,Leo,Tyrion,"He feasted on bloodlust and envy, and filled his cup full up with spite,My brother once  ruled seven kingdoms, he said to his harridan wife."
5380,Leo,Tyrion,"Let his son  feel the point of my knife.A brave young boy with hair of gold,if I am ever Hand again, the first thing Ill do is hang all the singers,A valiant deed unsung is  no less valiant.The dark lord assembled his legions, they gathered around him like crows.  "
5381,Craster,Qhorin,
5382,Garlan,Leo,"Perhaps you should be a singer, my lord.You rhyme as well as this Galyeon.No, my lady,My lord of Lannister was made to do great deeds, not to sing of them."
5383,Garlan,Tyrion,"And if Tyrions wildlings had  not slain most of Lord Stanniss scouts, we would never have been able to take him unawares."
5384,Sansa,Tyrion,"She never did that,Never believe anything you hear in a song, my lady."
5385,Joffrey,Tyrion,Bring on my royal jousters!
5386,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I yield, I yield,Good ser, put up your sword!I would, I would, if youll stop moving the sheath!"
5387,Joffrey,Tyrion,"A champion,We have a champion!"
5388,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Not a true champion, though,A true champion defeats all challengers."
5389,Joffrey,Tyrion,Who else will challenge our  tiny champion?
5390,Joffrey,Tyrion,Uncle!
5391,Joffrey,Tyrion,You can ride the pig!
5392,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Your Grace,Ill ride the pig ... but only if you ride the dog!"
5393,Joffrey,Tyrion,Me?
5394,Joffrey,Osmund,"Why me?Why, youre the only man in the hall that Im certain of defeating!"
5395,Garlan,Tyrion,"My lord, beware,The king."
5396,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Your Grace,"
5397,Joffrey,Tyrion,"How do you like that, Imp?"
5398,Garlan,Tyrion,"That was ill done, Your Grace,Not at all, Ser Garlan."
5399,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Not every king would think to honor a humble subject by serving him from his own royal  chalice.A pity the wine spilled.It didnt spill,And I wasnt serving  you, either."
5400,Joffrey,Olenna,"My sweet  king,come, return to your place, theres another singer waiting.Alaric of Eysen,I do so hope he plays us The Rains of  Castamere.It has been an hour, Ive forgotten how it goes.Ser Addam has a toast he wants to make as well,Your Grace, please.I have no wine,How can I drink a toast if I have no wine?"
5401,Joffrey,Tyrion,Since you wont joust youll be my cupbearer.I would be most honored.Its not meant to be an honor!
5402,Joffrey,Tyrion,Bend down and pick up my chalice.
5403,Joffrey,Tyrion,Pick it up!Are you  as clumsy as you are ugly?
5404,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Good, now fill it with  wine."
5405,Joffrey,Tyrion,"No, on your  knees, dwarf."
5406,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You can get  up now, Uncle."
5407,Cersei,Tywin,Your Grace.
5408,Joffrey,Tywin,They are bringing in the pie.Your sword is  needed.The pie?
5409,Joffrey,Tywin,"Come, my lady, its the pie."
5410,Joffrey,Margaery,Widows Wail was not meant for slicing pies.True.
5411,Ilyn,Joffrey,"Ser Ilyn, your sword!"
5412,Sansa,Tyrion,What sword is that?
5413,Robb,Sansa,What has Ser Ilyn done with my fathers sword?
5414,Sansa,Tyrion,"Youre deathly pale, my lady,You need a breath of cool air, and I need a fresh doublet."
5415,Joffrey,Tyrion,Come.
5416,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Uncle, where are you going?Youre my  cupbearer, remember?I need to change into fresh garb, Your Grace.May I have your leave?No."
5417,Joffrey,Tyrion,Serve me my wine.
5418,Joffrey,Tyrion,"My lord,we should return to our places."
5419,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Its ill luck not to eat the pie,See,  its good."
5420,Joffrey,Margaery,"Dry, though.Needs washing down."
5421,Joffrey,Margaery,"I want to see,  kof, see you ride that, kof kof, pig, Uncle."
5422,Craster,Qhorin,
5423,Joffrey,Margaery,"Your Grace?Its, kof, the pie, noth - kof, pie."
5424,Joffrey,Margaery,"I, kof, I cant, kof  kof kof kof ."
5425,Joffrey,Margaery,. 
5426,Garlan,Margaery,"Hes choking,"
5427,Garlan,Margaery,Help the poor boy!
5428,Garlan,Tyrion,Dolts!
5429,Garlan,Tyrion,Help your king!
5430,Mace,Pycelle,Turn him over!
5431,Mace,Pycelle,"Turn him over, shake him by his heels!Water, give him some water!"
5432,Robb,Tyrion,"Noooo,Father help him, someone help him, my son, my son..."
5433,Margaery,Tyrion,"Be brave, be brave."
5434,Joffrey,Tywin,"The boy is gone,  Cersei,"
5435,Joffrey,Tywin,Unhand him now.Let him go.
5436,Margaery,Tyrion,"Father Above, judge our good King Joffrey justly,"
5437,Cersei,Ilyn,We all saw.He did not choke.
5438,Cersei,Ilyn,My son was poisoned.
5439,Ilyn,Loras,"Kingsguard, do your duty.My lady?"
5440,Ilyn,Loras,"Arrest my brother,He did this, the dwarf."
5441,Ilyn,Loras,Take them both!
5442,Sansa,Tanda,"Joffrey is dead,"
5443,Sansa,Tanda,"You have a good heart, my  lady,Not every maid would weep so for a man who set her aside and wed her to a  dwarf."
5444,Sansa,Tanda,"The gods are cruel to take him so young  and handsome, at his own wedding feast,"
5445,Joffrey,Sansa,Whos there?
5446,Joffrey,Sansa,Who is it?
5447,Joffrey,Sansa,Me.
5448,Joffrey,Sansa,"Sweet  jonquil, Ive come.Your Florian has come, dont be afraid."
5449,Dontos,Sansa,"You said I must wear the hair net.The silver net with ... what sort of  stones are those?Amethysts.Black amethysts from Asshai, my lady.Theyre no amethysts."
5450,Dontos,Sansa,"You lied.Black amethysts,There was magic in them.There was murder in them!Softly, my lady, softly."
5451,Dontos,Sansa,He choked on his pigeon pie.
5452,Dontos,Sansa,"Oh, tasty tasty pie.Silver and stones, thats all it was, silver and stone and magic."
5453,Dontos,Sansa,You poisoned him.
5454,Dontos,Sansa,  
5455,Joffrey,Sansa,Your  husbands been arrested.Tyrion?
5456,Joffrey,Sansa,"Do you have another husband?The Imp, the dwarf uncle, she thinks he did it."
5457,Joffrey,Sansa,"This way, we must away, quickly now, have no fear."
5458,Joffrey,Nan,Tyrion poisoned him?
5459,Dontos,Sansa,"Be quiet now, my sweetling,Outside the godswood, we must make no sound.Pull up  your hood and hide your face."
5460,Dontos,Joffrey,Why are you wearing your  surcoat? Nothing Joffrey  had decreed mattered any longer.
5461,Dontos,Joffrey,"Come.Be quiet now, no questions."
5462,Dontos,Sansa,"Be strong now, my jonquil, you are  almost there."
5463,Bran,Dontos,"We must climb down,At the bottom, a man is waiting to row us out to the ship.Ill fall."
5464,Bran,Dontos,No you wont.
5465,Bran,Dontos,"Here, you can feel it, my  lady."
5466,Bran,Joffrey,Almost as good as rungs.
5467,Bran,Joffrey,I cant.You must.Isnt there another way?This is the way.
5468,Bran,Joffrey,Hold on tight and never look down  and youll be at the bottom in no time at all.
5469,Bran,Joffrey,"Your poor Florian is fat and old and  drunk, Im the one should be afraid."
5470,Dontos,Joffrey,"You saved  me, sweetling."
5471,Dontos,Joffrey,"And now you have saved me.Only if you go.If not, I have killed us both."
5472,Dontos,Joffrey,"You go first,  ser."
5473,Dontos,Joffrey,"As you wish, my lady."
5474,Dontos,Sansa,"Let me get down a bit, and come after."
5475,Dontos,Sansa,"You must swear it.Ill come,"
5476,Chett,Dontos,"This way.Quiet now, quiet, quiet."
5477,Chett,Dontos,"Oswell?No names,In the boat."
5478,Chett,Dontos,"Get in, be quick about it,We need to be away."
5479,Dontos,Sansa,How far must we go?
5480,Dontos,Sansa,No talk.
5481,Dontos,Sansa,Not far.
5482,Dontos,Sansa,"Your friend is near, waiting for  you.No talk!"
5483,Dontos,Sansa,"Sound carries over water, Ser Fool."
5484,Oswell,Sansa,"Up now.Go on, girl, I got you."
5485,Dontos,Sansa,"Shes cold,"
5486,Lothor,Sansa,"There, is that better, my  lady?Rest easy, the worst is past and done."
5487,Dontos,Lothor,"Lord Petyr,I must needs row back, before they think to look for me."
5488,Dontos,Petyr,"But first youll want your payment.Ten thousand dragons, was it?Ten thousand."
5489,Dontos,Lothor,"As you promised, my lord./  "
5490,Lothor,Sansa,You killed him.
5491,Joffrey,Sansa,"My lady,your grief is wasted on such a man as that."
5492,Dontos,Joffrey,"A bag of dragons    buys a mans silence for a while, but a well-placed quarrel buys it forever."
5493,Dontos,Joffrey,All he did  he did at my behest.
5494,Joffrey,Sansa,He said he was my Florian.Do you perchance recall what I said to you that day your father sat the Iron Throne?
5495,Dontos,Sansa,"You told me that life was not a song.That I would learn that one  day, to my sorrow."
5496,Sansa,Tyrion,"Is it all lies, forever and ever, everyone and everything?Almost everyone.Save you and , of course."
5497,Sansa,Tyrion,Come to the godswood tonight if you want  to go home.The note ... it was you?
5498,Petyr,Sansa,"Rats need to hide, lest men  skewer them with swords."
5499,Petyr,Sansa,Let me show you to your cabin.
5500,Joffrey,Petyr,You must be weary.
5501,Joffrey,Petyr,"Very weary,"
5502,Joffrey,Petyr,"The singers, the jugglers,  the dancing bear ... did your little lord husband enjoy my jousting dwarfs?Yours? I had to send to Braavos for them and hide them away in a brothel until the wedding."
5503,Craster,Qhorin,"  The deck rocked beneath her feet, and Sansa felt as if the world itself  had grown unsteady."
5504,Petyr,Sansa,"Widowhood will become you, Sansa."
5505,Petyr,Tyrion,"It will be snug, I know, but you shouldnt be too  uncomfortable."
5506,Joffrey,Petyr,Youll find fresh garb within.
5507,Harren,Joffrey,"Unworthy of a maid so    beautiful, but theyll serve to keep you dry and clean until we can find you something finer."
5508,Harren,Joffrey,"My lord, I ...  "
5509,Harren,Petyr,I had no motive.
5510,Hoster,Sansa,"Remember that, Sansa, when you come  to play the game.What ... what game?The only game.The game of thrones."
5511,Hoster,Sansa,You are old enough to  know that your mother and I were more than friends.
5512,Dontos,Tyrion,"You are safe with me, and sailing  home."
5513,Joffrey,Rowan,"The Imp opened his throat with a dagger,He drank his blood from a big gold chalice."
5514,Jaime,Rowan,"It was poison did the deed,The boys face turned black as a plum.May the Father judge him justly,The dwarfs wife did the murder with him,Afterward, she  vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone, and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep,  blood dripping from his jaws."
5515,Jaime,Walton,Whats that awful stink?
5516,Craster,Qhorin,
5517,Cersei,Jaime,Youve never smelled a city before?I smelled White Harbor.It never stank like this.White Harbor is to Kings Landing as my brother Tyrion is to Ser Gregor Clegane.
5518,Cersei,Jaime,How would it look?
5519,Cersei,Jaime,Bad enough Joffrey  looks like you without you mooning over him.
5520,Harren,Jaime,"I want my arms and armor back,Oh, by all  means, let us have you back in steel,A helm, especially.Well all be happier if you keep  your mouth shut and your visor down."
5521,Cleos,Jaime,"Kings Landing,Our journeys done, my lady."
5522,Brienne,Catelyn,All but a few fingers and a hand.
5523,Brienne,Catelyn,That was only half my vow.
5524,Craster,Qhorin,
5525,Brienne,Jaime,With the Young Wolf dead Piper  saw no point to fighting on.His son is captive at the Twins.
5526,Brienne,Jaime,"Every great lord has unruly bannermen who envy him his place,My father had  the Reynes and Tarbecks, the Tyrells have the Florents, Hoster Tully had Walder Frey."
5527,Brienne,Jaime,"The moment they smell weakness ... during the Age of Heroes, the  Boltons used to flay the Starks and wear their skins as cloaks."
5528,Brienne,Robin,wench
5529,Jaime,Vargo,"Ill speak to my father about returning you to Tarth, if it please you,Or if you  would rather stay, I could perchance find some place for you at court.As a lady companion to the queen?"
5530,Jaime,Vargo,Perhaps a post with the City Watch...I will not serve with oathbreakers and murderers.
5531,Jaime,Vargo,"As  you will, Brienne."
5532,Chett,Jaime,Whats this?
5533,Chett,Jaime,They got to pay for the right to sell inside the city.By command of the Kings Hand and the master of  coin.
5534,Chett,Jaime,"Yet they still line up to pay?Theres good coin to be made here now that the fightings done,Its the Lannisters hold the city now, old Lord Tywin of the Rock.They say he shits    silver.Gold,And Petyr mints the stuff from goldenrod, I vow.The Imp is master of coin now,Or was, till they arrested him for  murdering the king."
5535,Jaime,Joffrey,"Who are you lot?Lord Boltons men, come to see the Kings Hand."
5536,Jaime,Joffrey,"Come to bend the knee, you mean."
5537,Jaime,Joffrey,"Go straight up to the castle, and see you make no trouble."
5538,Jaime,Meryn,"They do not know me,Your face is changed, and your arms as well,"
5539,Jaime,Meryn,Ser Meryn.
5540,Jaime,Meryn,Ser Jaime?How nice to be remembered.Move these men aside.
5541,Cersei,Jaime,"Someone has given me two new brothers, I see,We have that honor, ser."
5542,Jaime,Meryn,"Ser, youve been remiss in teaching our new brothers their duties.What duties?"
5543,Jaime,Meryn,Keeping the king alive.
5544,Balon,Jaime,"Two, is it? "
5545,Balon,Jaime,Your hand...I fight with my left now.
5546,Jaime,Mace,Where will I find my  lord father?In the solar with Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn.
5547,Balon,Mace,"Is the queen with them  as well?No, my lord,Youll find her in the sept, praying over King Joffrey -  "
5548,Brienne,Loras,Ser Loras.
5549,Brienne,Loras,Why?
5550,Brienne,Loras,You will tell me why.
5551,Brienne,Loras,Why would you kill him?I never did.I would have died for him.You will.
5552,Loras,Renly,"It was not me.Emmon Cuy swore it was, with his dying breath.He was outside the tent, he never saw - There was no one in the tent but you and Lady Stark."
5553,Catelyn,Jaime,  
5554,Jaime,Loras,I wont have it said that I slew you while your hand was empty.
5555,Jaime,Loras,"Put the sword away, ser."
5556,Jaime,Loras,"Are you a craven as well as a killer, Brienne?"
5557,Jaime,Loras,"Draw your sword, woman!Best hope she doesnt."
5558,Jaime,Loras,"Or its like to be your corpse we carry out.The  wench is as strong as Gregor Clegane, though not so pretty.This is no concern of yours."
5559,Jaime,Loras,"I am the Lord Commander of the  Kingsguard, you arrogant pup."
5560,Balon,Jaime,"Now sheathe  your bloody sword, or Ill take it from you and shove it up some place even Renly never found.Do as the Lord  Commander says, Loras."
5561,Jaime,Loras,"That wasnt so difficult, was it?I want her arrested."
5562,Jaime,Loras,"Lady Brienne, I charge you with the murder of Lord Renly  Baratheon.For what its worth,"
5563,Balon,Brienne,"And find some suitable quarters for  Steelshanks and his men, until such time as my father can see them.Yes, my lord."
5564,Aerys,Jaime,And where do  you think youre going?Into the sept.That one right there.I mean to see the queen.Her Grace is in mourning.And why would she be wanting to see the likes of you?
5565,Jaime,Osmund,"Who in seven hells are  you?A knight of the Kingsguard, and youd best learn some respect, cripple, or Ill have that other hand and  leave you to suck up your porridge of a morning.I am the queens brother, ser."
5566,Jaime,Osmund,"Escaped, have you?And grown a bit as well, mlord?Her other brother, dolt."
5567,Cersei,Osmund,"Now stand aside, or youll wish    you had."
5568,Cersei,Osmund,Is it ... Ser Jaime.
5569,Cersei,Osmund,"My pardons, milord."
5570,Cersei,Osmund,I have the honor to be Ser Osmund Kettleblack.
5571,Cersei,Osmund,I want some time alone with my sister.
5572,Cersei,Osmund,"If were disturbed, Ill have your bloody head.Aye, ser.As you say."
5573,Cersei,Joffrey,Who?Jaime?
5574,Jaime,Joffrey,Is it truly you?
5575,Jaime,Joffrey,"You should have come sooner,Why couldnt you have come sooner, to keep him safe?"
5576,Cersei,Jaime,I came as fast I could.
5577,Cersei,Jaime,"Its war out  there, Sister.You look so thin."
5578,Cersei,Jaime,The hair will grow back.
5579,Cersei,Jaime,This wont.
5580,Cersei,Jaime,The Starks...No.
5581,Cersei,Joffrey,Who?The Goat of Harrenhal.For a little while.
5582,Cersei,Jaime,"He killed him,  Jaime."
5583,Cersei,Jaime,"One day when I thought myself safe and happy he would turn my joy to  ashes in my mouth, he said.Tyrion said that?"
5584,Joffrey,Tyrion,Why would he kill Joffrey ? For a whore.
5585,Jaime,Joffrey,He told me he was going to do it.
5586,Jaime,Joffrey,At our twisted little monster of a brother.
5587,Jaime,Joffrey,"Youll kill him for me, wont you?Youll avenge our son."
5588,Jaime,Joffrey,He is still my brother.
5589,Jaime,Tyrion,"And I am in no flt state to be killing anyone.You have another hand, dont you?"
5590,Cersei,Tyrion,The guards would stand aside for you.
5591,Cersei,Tyrion,"I must know more of this.Of how it happened.You shall,Theres to be a trial.When you hear all he did, youll want him dead as  much as I do."
5592,Cersei,Tyrion,"I was lost without you, Jaime."
5593,Cersei,Tyrion,I could not have borne that.
5594,Cersei,Tyrion,I am not whole without you.
5595,Cersei,Tyrion,"No,"
5596,Cersei,Tyrion,. The Others can take the septons.
5597,Cersei,Jaime,"Hurry,quickly, quickly, now, do it now, do me now."
5598,Cersei,Jaime,"Yes,my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that,  yes, I have you, youre home now, youre home now, youre home."
5599,Craster,Qhorin,
5600,Cersei,Jaime,.
5601,Cersei,Jaime,This was folly.
5602,Cersei,Jaime,"With Father in the castle ... Jaime, we must be  careful.I am sick of being careful."
5603,Cersei,Jaime,"Well have our own wedding feast, and  make another son in place of Joffrey."
5604,Cersei,Jaime,Thats not funny.Do you hear me chuckling?Did you leave your wits at Riverrun?
5605,Cersei,Jaime,"Tommens throne derives from  Robert, you know that.Hell have Casterly Rock, isnt that enough?"
5606,Cersei,Jaime,All I want is you.
5607,Cersei,Jaime,Dont ... dont talk like this.
5608,Cersei,Jaime,"What did they do to you?They cut off my hand.No, its more, youre changed."
5609,Cersei,Jaime,Well talk later.
5610,Cersei,Jaime,"I have Sansa  Starks maids in a tower cell, I need to question them ... you should go to Father.I crossed a thousand leagues to come to you, and lost the best part of me along the way.Dont tell me  to leave.Leave me,"
5611,Catelyn,Tywin,"The gods  are good, to give you back to us, ser,The gods had no part in it."
5612,Catelyn,Tywin,"Her, and the Lord of the Dreadfort."
5613,Mace,Tywin,"Jaime,Lord Bolton led me to expect  you earlier.I had hoped youd be here for the wedding.I was delayed."
5614,Jaime,Tywin,"My sister outdid herself, Im told."
5615,Gregor,Samwell,How long have you known I was free?The eunuch told me a few days after your escape.
5616,Tywin,Varys,"We agreed  that the fewer people who knew you were free, the fewer would be hunting you.Did Varys mention this?"
5617,Catelyn,Tywin,Who did this?  
5618,Gregor,Tywin,"Vargo Hoat, the Lord of Harrenhal! "
5619,Gregor,Tywin,No longer.
5620,Brienne,Jaime,"His ear, Im told."
5621,Brienne,Jaime,"Is he dead yet?Soon.They have taken off his hands and feet, but Clegane seems amused by the way the Qohorik  slobbers."
5622,Brienne,Jaime,What about his Brave Companions?The few who stayed at Harrenhal are dead.
5623,Brienne,Jaime,"Theyll make for ports, Ill warrant, or  try and lose themselves in the woods."
5624,Jaime,Varys,Well have their heads.
5625,Jaime,Varys,Can you use a sword with your left hand?
5626,Jaime,Varys,"Four fingers, a thumb, much like the other.Why shouldnt it work as well?Good."
5627,Jaime,Varys,That is good.
5628,Jaime,Varys,"Unless its a new hand, let it wait."
5629,Jaime,Varys,"How did Joffrey die?Poison.It was meant to appear as though he choked on a morsel of food, but I had his throat slit open  and the maesters could find no obstruction.Cersei claims that Tyrion did it.Your brother served the king the poisoned wine, with a thousand people looking on.That was rather foolish of him.I have taken Tyrions squire into custody."
5630,Addam,Varys,The  kings justice will be done.
5631,Jaime,Varys,You would execute your own son?He stands accused of regicide and kinslaying.
5632,Jaime,Varys,First we must  needs consider the evidence for and against him.
5633,Jaime,Loras,"Renly died strangely  as well, when Stannis needed him to.Lord Renly was murdered by one of his own guards, some woman from Tarth.That woman from Tarth is the reason Im here."
5634,Stannis,Tywin,  
5635,Jaime,Tywin,"You cannot  serve in the Kingsguard without a sword hand - I can,And I will."
5636,Jaime,Tywin,"Crippled or whole, a knight of the Kingsguard serves for life.Cersei ended that when she replaced Ser Barristan on grounds of age."
5637,Jaime,Tywin,  
5638,Jaime,Tywin,"I am tired of having highborn women kicking pails  of shit at me, Father."
5639,Jaime,Tywin,  
5640,Jaime,Tywin,A duty to House Lannister.
5641,Jaime,Tommen,  
5642,Oberyn,Robert,No.
5643,Joffrey,Robert,    
5644,Joffrey,Tywin,And thats all I mean to be!
5645,Jaime,Tywin,Father .
5646,Jaime,Tywin,. 
5647,Jaime,Tywin,You are not my son.
5648,Jaime,Tywin,"You say you are the Lord Commander of the  Kingsguard, and only that."
5649,Jaime,Tywin,Go do your duty.
5650,Davos,Tywin,"Lead us from the darkness,  my  Lord.Fill our hearts with fire, so we may walk your shining path."
5651,Melisandre,Selyse,"WhIlor,you are the light in  our eyes, the fire in our hearts, the heat in our loins."
5652,Davos,Shireen,"Lord of Light, protect us,"
5653,Melisandre,Selyse,"WhIlor who gave us breath, we thank you,Rhllor who gave us day, we thank you.We thank you for the sun that warms us,We thank you for the stars that watch us.We thank you for our hearths and  for our torches, that keep the savage dark at bay."
5654,Craster,Qhorin,
5655,Axell,Selyse,"Guide  him and defend him, Rhllor, and grant him strength to smite his foes.Grant him strength,Grant him courage.Grant him wisdom."
5656,Andrew,Devan,Lord Davos?Wed best be about it.
5657,Andrew,Davos,My lord?
5658,Melisandre,Stannis,Aye.Its time.
5659,Andrew,Davos,"Fire is a living thing,It is always moving, always changing ... like a book whose letters dance and shift even as  you try to read them."
5660,Axell,Davos,"You do not understand that, you men  of the sunset lands.Any cat may stare into a fire and see red mice  at play."
5661,Axell,Davos,"The red woman may see what we intend,We should start by killing her, then,I know a place where we could  waylay her, four of us with sharp swords ."
5662,Axell,Davos,". Youd doom us all,Maester Cressen tried to kill her, and she knew at once."
5663,Davos,Melisandre,"if we ignore her, perhaps we might escape her notice.There is no honor in hiding and sneaking,Is it so honorable to burn? "
5664,Davos,Melisandre,You saw Lord Sunglass die.
5665,Edric,Pylos,"Are you with me, or no?"
5666,Andrew,Davos,"That will be enough for now, Edric."
5667,Andrew,Edric,"Lord Davos, Ser Andrew.We were doing sums."
5668,Andrew,Edric,"I hated sums when I was your age, coz.I dont mind them so much."
5669,Andrew,Edric,"its full of tales.Edric,run and get your cloak now."
5670,Davos,Edric,Where are we going?
5671,Davos,Edric,"I wont go pray to the  Lord of Light.I am a Warriors man, like my father.We know,Come, lad, we must not dawdle."
5672,Davos,Pylos,"Are you coming with us, Maester?"
5673,Davos,Pylos,No.
5674,Davos,Pylos,My place is here on  Dragonstone.
5675,Davos,Pylos,What did  I tell you about the Kings Hand?The Hand speaks with the kings voice.
5676,Davos,Pylos,Thats so.Go now.
5677,Andrew,Edric,"Where are we going, Lord Davos?To the water.A ship awaits you."
5678,Andrew,Edric,"A ship?One of Salladhor Saans.Salla is a good friend of mine.I shall go with you, Cousin,Theres nothing to be frightened of.I am not frightened,Only ... is Shireen coming too?No,The princess must remain here with her father and mother.I have to see her then,To say my farewells.Otherwise shell be sad."
5679,Davos,Edric,"There is no time,I will tell the princess that you were  thinking of her.And you can write her, when you get to where youre going."
5680,Davos,Edric,Are you sure I must go?
5681,Andrew,Davos,I never meant to.
5682,Andrew,Edric,I want to see my uncle.I want to see  King Stannis.
5683,Andrew,Edric,"Theres no time for that, Cousin,I want to see him!"
5684,Davos,Edric,He does not want to see you.
5685,Davos,Edric,"I am his Hand, I  speak with his voice."
5686,Davos,Stannis,Have you ever seen your uncle angry?
5687,Edric,Stannis,I have.
5688,Davos,Edric,"He should not have done that,"
5689,Davos,Edric,The boat?
5690,Davos,Edric,"Its there,Four oarsmen."
5691,Davos,Edric,Mad Prendos.
5692,Davos,Edric,"I must leave you now,Theres a boat waiting, to  row you out to a galley."
5693,Davos,Edric,"You are Roberts son so I know you will be brave,  no matter what happens.I will. The boy hesitated."
5694,Andrew,Davos,"Its the start of your  lifes great adventure.May the Warrior defend you.And may the Father judge you justly, Lord Davos."
5695,Andrew,Davos,These two?
5696,Andrew,Davos,"Drag them into a cellar,You can cut them free when Edrics safely under way."
5697,Davos,Devan,ser
5698,Melisandre,Stannis,.
5699,Craster,Qhorin, he was saying. came Melisandres answer.
5700,Melisandre,Stannis,The flames are full of tricks.
5701,Davos,Melisandre,.Your Grace.
5702,Davos,Melisandre,Lady Melisandre saw it true.Your nephew Joffrey is dead.
5703,Davos,Melisandre,"Lord Davos,He was not my nephew.Though for years I believed he was.He choked on a morsel of food at his wedding feast,It may be that he was poisoned.He is the third,I can count, woman."
5704,Melisandre,Stannis,"Weddings have become more perilous than battles, it  would seem."
5705,Melisandre,Stannis,"Is it known?His uncle, its said.The Imp."
5706,Melisandre,Stannis,A dangerous man.
5707,Melisandre,Stannis,How do you come by this  report?The Lyseni still trade at Kings Landing.Salladhor Saan has no reason to lie to me.I suppose not.
5708,Joffrey,Stannis,Joffrey ...
5709,Joffrey,Melisandre,Robert hit the boy so hard I thought hed  killed him.
5710,Melisandre,Stannis,"Dwarf or leech, this killer served the  kingdom well.They must send for me now.They will not,Joffrey has a brother.Tommen."
5711,Melisandre,Stannis,"They will crown Tommen, and rule in his name."
5712,Melisandre,Stannis,"Tommen is gentler than Joffrey, but bom of the same incest."
5713,Melisandre,Stannis,"Westeros needs a mans hand, not a childs."
5714,Davos,Melisandre,"Save them, sire."
5715,Davos,Stannis,"Give me the  boy.Edric Storm,"
5716,Spare,Stannis,I know his name.
5717,Melisandre,Spare,. 
5718,Melisandre,Spare,"You swear there  is no other way?Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie.You are he who must stand against the Other."
5719,Davos,Melisandre,"You are the prince that was promised, and if you fail the  world fails with you."
5720,Davos,Stannis,"Give me this boy,and I will give you your kingdom.He cant,Edric Storm is gone.Gone?"
5721,Davos,Stannis,"What do you mean, gone?He is aboard a Lyseni galley, safely out to sea."
5722,Davos,Melisandre,The bastard was taken from  Dragonstone without my leave?
5723,Davos,Melisandre,  
5724,Davos,Melisandre,"You will bring him back, my  lord.You will.The boy is out of my reach,And out of your reach as well, my lady."
5725,Davos,Stannis,"I should have left you to the dark, ser.Do you know what you have  done?My duty.Some might call it treason."
5726,Davos,Stannis,"I raised you up from dirt, Davos."
5727,Davos,Stannis,Was loyalty too much to    hope for?Four of my sons died for you on the Blackwater.
5728,Davos,Edric,"You have my loyalty,  always."
5729,Edric,Stannis,"Your Grace, you made me swear to give you honest counsel and swift obedience,  to defend your realm against your foes, to protect your people."
5730,Edric,Stannis,How could that be treason?
5731,Edric,Stannis,I never asked for this crown.
5732,Davos,Melisandre,"Tell him, my lady."
5733,Davos,Melisandre,". She talks of cows,I am speaking of a boy, your daughters friend, your brothers  son.A kings son, with the power of kingsblood in his veins."
5734,Edric,Melisandre,"Do you think youve saved this boy, Onion Knight?"
5735,Davos,Edric,"You meddle in matters you do not understand.Theres much I dont understand,I have never pretended elsewise."
5736,Davos,Stannis,"And I know that a king protects his people, or he is no king at all."
5737,Davos,Stannis,Do you mock me to my face?Must I learn a kings duty from an onion  smuggler?
5738,Davos,Stannis,"If I have offended, take my head."
5739,Davos,Stannis,"Hear  me for the sake of the onions I brought you, and the fingers you took."
5740,Davos,Stannis,"Say what you will, but say it  quickly."
5741,Davos,Stannis,A Kings Hand should be able to read and write.Maester  Pylos has been teaching me.
5742,Chett,Jacelyn,Father?
5743,Chett,Jacelyn,Bran?Rickon?
5744,Chett,Jacelyn,Uncle?
5745,Chett,Jacelyn,Uncle Benjen?
5746,Chett,Jacelyn,"Please, Father, help me."
5747,Chett,Ygritte,Ygritte?
5748,Chett,Ygritte,Forgive me.Please.
5749,Jon,Satin,Is it Mance Rayder?
5750,Jon,Satin,We can hope so.
5751,Donal,Jon,"I hope it wasnt one of them who blew the  horn,Did you hear that?"
5752,Donal,Jon,"A mammoth,That was a mammoth."
5753,Donal,Mance,How do we fight them if we cant see them?
5754,Bowen,Donal,Give me light!
5755,Bowen,Jon,NOW!
5756,Alyn,Jon,Again!
5757,Jon,Mance,The gate!
5758,Jon,Mance,Theyre at the GATE
5759,Mance,Owen,"Must be cold down there,What say we warm them up, lads?"
5760,Donal,Satin,"Any man here stays his sword, Ill chuck his puckered arse right off this  Wall ... starting with you, Septon."
5761,Mully,Satin,"Do we have any bloody archers?Here,And here,But how can I find a target?"
5762,Mully,Satin,Where are  they?
5763,Mully,Satin,"Loose enough arrows, might be youll find a few.At least youll make them fretful."
5764,Jon,Mully,I need two bows and two spears to help me hold the tunnel if  they break the gate.
5765,Jon,Mully,"Jon, you have the  Wall till I return."
5766,Jon,Mully,My lord?Lord?
5767,Jon,Mully,"I said, the Wall is yours."
5768,Jon,Mully,"Aye,"
5769,Craster,Qhorin,"Mother have mercy, oh."
5770,Tormund,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow,"
5771,Jon,Satin,"I never knew there would be so many,"
5772,Jon,Satin,"Here they come,"
5773,Jon,Satin,"There must be a hundred thousand,How can  we stop so many?The Wall will stop them,"
5774,Jon,Satin,The Wall will stop  them.The Wall defends itself.
5775,Jon,Owen,Mance wants to unman us with his numbers.Does he think were stupid?
5776,Grenn,Owen,"The chariots, the horsemen, all those fools  on foot ... what are they going to do to us up here?Any of you ever see a mammoth climb a wall?"
5777,Grenn,Owen,"Theyre nothing, theyre less use  than our straw brothers here, they cant reach us, they cant hurt us, and they dont frighten us, do they?NOTheyre down there and were up here,and so long as we hold the gate they cannot pass."
5778,Jon,Kegs,"Brother,sound for battle. "
5779,Kegs,Owen,"Archers,"
5780,Jon,Owen,"Any man who wastes an arrow will need to  climb down and fetch it back, do you hear me?I do,I hear you, Lord Snow."
5781,Jon,Owen,"Load the trebuchet with caltrops,Owen, Kegs, angle the catapults toward the center.Scorpions, load with fire spears and loose at my  command."
5782,Jon,Owen,"You, you, and you, stand by with torches."
5783,Jon,Satin,"Let them shoot,Wait.Hold."
5784,Jon,Satin,"The wind is in our faces, it will cost us range.Wait."
5785,Jon,Satin,DRAW.
5786,Emrick,Jon,LOOSE
5787,Chett,Jon,NOTCH.
5788,Chett,Jon,LOOSE.
5789,Chett,Jon,NOTCH.DRAW LOOSE.
5790,Chett,Jon,"Catapults,scorpions."
5791,Dick,Jon,"Fire arrows,I  want that ram burning."
5792,Jon,Spare,At the  gate!
5793,Jon,Spare,"Mammoth at the gate!Fire,Grenn, Pyp."
5794,Kegs,Satin,Got him!
5795,Jon,Satin,"Got him, got him, GOT him!"
5796,Mance,Spare,Do we have  anyone hurt?
5797,Mance,Spare,The bloody buggers got my leg.
5798,Owen,Spare,The  wooden one!
5799,Grenn,Jon,"No,"
5800,Grenn,Jon,"Pyp, help me to the cage.Grenn, you have the Wall.Me?"
5801,Grenn,Jon,Him?
5802,Grenn,Jon,"But,b-but what do I do if the wildlings attack again?Stop them,"
5803,Grenn,Jon,Frozen sweat.Is there  anything as disgusting as frozen sweat?
5804,Grenn,Jon,"Gods, I dont think I have ever been so hungry."
5805,Grenn,Jon,Do you think Hobb will cook up Grenn for us?
5806,Donal,Jon,"Whats wrong?Is it your leg?My leg,"
5807,Donal,Jon,"Not the battle, though?We won the battle.Ask me when Ive seen the gate,"
5808,Clydas,Jon,"Come see me when we are done,I need to change your dressing and apply a fresh  poultice, and you will want some more drearnwine for the pain."
5809,Aemon,Jon,Theres blood on the floor.
5810,Aemon,Pate,Are they all dead?
5811,Aemon,Jon,Yes.Donal was the last.
5812,Aemon,Jon,The giant crushed his spine.I dont know who died first.
5813,Clydas,Jon,Mag.
5814,Clydas,Jon,It was Mag the Mighty.The king of the giants.
5815,Aemon,Jon,We need to repair the outer gate as best we can and  then block up this section of the tunnel.
5816,Aemon,Jon,"   said Maester Aemon, gently."
5817,Donal,Jon,"You know that as well as Donal did,  Jon."
5818,Donal,Jon,"You give the order, then,You have been on the Wall your whole  life, the men will follow you.We have to close the gate.I am a maester chained and sworn."
5819,Donal,Jon,"We give counsel, not commands.Someone must - You."
5820,Benjen,Qhorin,"The Wall is  yours, Jon Snow."
5821,Arya,Sandor,"Dry off and feed the bloody horses,"
5822,Gendry,Sandor,"Away,Thats all you need to know."
5823,Arya,Sandor,"I should have let you run into that bloody castle.You should have,Youd be dead if I had."
5824,Arya,Sandor,"You ought to sing me a pretty little song, the way your  sister did.Did you hit her with an axe too?I hit you with the flat of the axe, you stupid little bitch."
5825,Arya,Sandor,They cut the tongues out of girls who talk too much.
5826,Chett,Marq,"Hunting for stray northmen,Any time you hear hooves, get your head down fast, its not like to be a friend."
5827,Edmure,Marq,"A northman, it was,His badge was a bloody man,  and he saw mine and made a jape, red man and pink maiden, maybe they should get together."
5828,Edmure,Roslin,And then he killed me.
5829,Arya,Sandor,"If Id had any wine, Id have drunk it myself,I can give you water, and the gift of  mercy.Youre Joffreys dog. My own dog now.Do you want the water?Aye."
5830,Arya,Sandor,And the mercy.Please.
5831,Arya,Sandor,"Good,I wish it was wine, though.I wanted wine.Me too."
5832,Arya,Sandor,"Thats where the heart is, girl.Thats how you kill a man."
5833,Arya,Sandor,Will we bury him?Why?
5834,Arya,Sandor,"He dont care, and weve got no spade."
5835,Arya,Sandor,Your brothers and mine.
5836,Arya,Sandor,"First we rob him, though."
5837,Arya,Moon,"He must have had a horse as well, or  he wouldnt have got away,but its bloody well gone, Id say."
5838,Arya,Moon,Where are we going?
5839,Arya,Lysa,You have an aunt in the Eyrie.
5840,Arya,Lysa,"Once we find the high road, we can follow it all the way to the  Bloody Gate."
5841,Joffrey,Robb,"We should go back,We should go back to the Twins and get my mother."
5842,Arya,Joffrey,"We have to help her.I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs,Frey might have kept  your mother alive to ransom, thats true.But theres no way in seven hells Im going to pluck her out of his  castle all by my bloody self.Not by yourself.Id come too."
5843,Arya,Joffrey,That will scare the piss out of the old man.Youre just afraid to die!
5844,Arya,Joffrey,Death dont scare me.
5845,Arya,Sandor,Its the Vale for us.
5846,Arya,Sandor,"This thing about your mother...It doesnt matter,I know shes dead.I saw her in a dream."
5847,Arya,Sandor,"We need food,and a roof over our heads."
5848,Arya,Timett,"If theres wine as  well, Ill do it,"
5849,Arya,Timett,"Theres frost above us and snow  in the high passes,If you dont freeze or starve, the shadowcats will get you, or  the cave bears."
5850,Arya,Weasel,"Might be youd take a few with you, but in the end theyd kill  you and make off with your daughter."
5851,Arya,Small,"Go away,Just leave me be."
5852,Arya,Chett,Now he really looks like a soldier!
5853,Arya,Chett,"Might be we should stay here awhile,"
5854,Arya,Sandor,"Wed never reach the Eyrie, and the Freys will still be hunting survivors in  the riverlands."
5855,Arya,Sandor,"We can rest up, maybe  find a way to get a letter to your aunt."
5856,Arya,Sandor,"Come winter, we will be hard pressed to feed our own,And you ... a man like you brings blood with him."
5857,Arya,Sandor,So you do know who I am.Aye.
5858,Arya,Sandor,"We know about King  Joffreys dog.When these Stone Crows come calling, you might be glad to have a dog.Might be."
5859,Arya,Sandor,But they say you lost your belly for  fighting at the Blackwater.  
5860,Arya,Sandor,"Pay me, and  well be gone."
5861,Arya,Sandor,"Well make for Riverrun,Maybe the Brynden wants to buy himself a she-wolf.He doesnt know me.He wont even know Im really me."
5862,Arya,Sandor,He wont give you any ransom.Hell probably just hang you.Hes free to try.
5863,Arya,Sandor,"I know where we could go,"
5864,Arya,Sandor,little sister
5865,Arya,Sandor,We could go to the Wall.
5866,Arya,Sandor,"The little wolf bitch wants to join the Nights Watch, does she?My brothers on the Wall,"
5867,Arya,Sandor,The Walls a thousand leagues from here.
5868,Arya,Sandor,"And if we did reach the north with our skins intact, theres ironborn in half the castles, and  thousands of bloody buggering northmen as well.Are you scared of them?"
5869,Arya,Sandor,Have you lost your belly for fighting?
5870,Arya,Sandor,"Theres nothing wrong with my belly,but I dont give a rats arse for you or your brother."
5871,Mace,Tyrion,"Tyrion,if you are indeed innocent of Joffreys death, you should  have no difficulty  proving it at trial."
5872,Mace,Tyrion,Who is to judge me? justice belongs to the throne.
5873,Mace,Tyrion,"Since it is his own son  who stands accused and his grandson who was the victim, he has asked Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn  to sit in judgment with him."
5874,Joffrey,Mace,Will I be allowed to demand trial by battle?I would not advise that.Why not?
5875,Bronn,Joffrey,"Answer me, Uncle.Will I be allowed a trial by  battle, and a champion to prove my innocence?Certainly, if such is your wish.However, you had best know that your sister means to name Ser Gregor  Clegane as her champion, in the event of such a trial."
5876,Bronn,Kevan,I shall need to sleep on this.
5877,Bronn,Kevan,"Does Cersei have  witnesses against me?More every day.Then I must have witnesses of my own.Tell me who you would have, and Ser Addarn will send the Watch to bring them to the trial.I would sooner find them myself.You stand accused of regicide and kinslaying.Do you truly imagine you will be allowed to come and go  as you please?"
5878,Bronn,Kevan,"You have quill, ink, and parchment."
5879,Kevan,Tyrion,"But you shall not leave this tower, except to go to trial."
5880,Kevan,Tyrion,"Will you permit my squire to come and go?The boy  Podrick Payne?Certainly, if that is your wish.I shall send him to you.Do so.Sooner would be better than later, and now would be better than sooner."
5881,Kevan,Tyrion,Uncle?
5882,Kevan,Tyrion,"Yes?I did not do this.I wish I could believe that, Tyrion."
5883,Podrick,Tyrion,"My lord,"
5884,Podrick,Tyrion,"Find Bronn and bring him at once.Tell him theres gold in it, more gold than  hes ever dreamt of, and see that you dont return without him.Yes, my lord."
5885,Podrick,Tyrion,Return.
5886,Sansa,Tyrion,Have  you seen my squire?
5887,Kevan,Varys,"Lady Sansa is your  only witness?I will think of others in time.Best think of them now.The judges mean to begin the trial three days hence.Thats too soon.You have me shut up here under guard, how am I to find witnesses to my innocence?Your sisters had no difficulty finding witnesses to your guilt."
5888,Kevan,Varys,Ser  Addam has men hunting for your wife.
5889,Bronn,Podrick,"I see no harm in husband and wife sharing the same cell and giving comfort to one another.You are too kind.Have you seen my squire?I sent him to you yesterday.Did he not come?He came,and then he went.I shall send him to you again."
5890,Bronn,Tyrion,"It took you long  enough.The boy begged, or I wouldnt have come at all.I am expected at Castle Stokeworth for supper.Stokeworth?"
5891,Bronn,Tyrion,"And pray, what is there for you in Stokeworth?A bride."
5892,Bronn,Tanda,Im to wed Lollys the day after next.Lollys.
5893,Cersei,Tyrion,"My bitch sister has sold you a lame horse.The girls dim-witted.If I wanted wits, Id marry you.Lollys is big with another mans child.And when she pops him out, Ill get her big with mine.Shes not even heir to Stokeworth,She has an elder sister."
5894,Bronn,Falyse,"A married  sister.Married ten years, and still barren,Her lord husband shuns her bed.Its said he prefers  virgins.He could prefer goats and it wouldnt matter.The lands will still pass to his wife when Lady Tanda  dies.Unless Falyse should die before her mother."
5895,Bronn,Tanda,"Why are you here, then?"
5896,Bronn,Tanda,"You once told me that if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, youd double the  price."
5897,Bronn,Tanda,"Is it two wives you want, or two castles?One of each would serve.But if you want me to kill Gregor Clegane for you, it had best be a damned  big castle."
5898,Bronn,Tyrion,"I find myself woefully short of both castles and highborn maidens at the moment,But  I can offer you gold and gratitude, as before.I have gold.What can I buy with gratitude?You might be surprised.A Lannister pays his debts.Your sister is a Lannister too.My lady wife is heir to Winterfell."
5899,Bronn,Lollys,"I could carve you out a big piece of it.If and when and might be,And its bloody cold up there."
5900,Bronn,Lollys,I  could be poking her two nights hence.Not a prospect I would relish.Is that so?
5901,Bronn,Tyrion,"Admit it, Imp.Given a choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the  Mountain, youd have your breeches down and cock up before a man could blink."
5902,Bronn,Tyrion,"Id heard  that Ser Gregor was wounded on the Red Fork, and again at Duskendale.The wounds are bound to  slow him."
5903,Bronn,Tyrion,He was never fast.
5904,Bronn,Tyrion,"He has a monstrous long reach, and doesnt seem to feel  blows the way a normal man would.Does he frighten you so much? "
5905,Bronn,Tyrion,"if he didnt frighten me, Id be a bloody fool."
5906,Bronn,Tyrion,Might be I could take him.
5907,Lollys,Tyrion,"Im not your bloody brother.No,Youre not."
5908,Lollys,Tyrion,"Begone, then."
5909,Bronn,Lollys,May you find more joy in your marriage bed than I ever found in mine.
5910,Bronn,Lollys,"What will you do, Imp?Kill Gregor myself.Wont that make for a jolly song?,I hope I hear them sing it."
5911,Bronn,Tyrion,Im sorry.Why?
5912,Bronn,Tyrion,Thats what I liked about him.
5913,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Ser Addam,I had thought my father might send the Kingsguard to escort me to trial.I  am still a member of the royal family, am I not?You are, my lord, but I fear that most of the Kingsguard stand witness against you.Lord Tywin felt it  would not be proper for them to serve as your guards.Gods forbid we do anything improper.Please, lead on."
5914,Oberyn,Sansa,"Tyrion, did you kill King Joffrey?"
5915,Oberyn,Sansa,"No.Well, thats a relief,Did Sansa Stark do it, then?"
5916,Tyrion,Tywin,The gods killed Joffrey.He choked on his pigeon pie.
5917,Tyrion,Tywin,"You would blame the bakers?Them, or the pigeons.just leave me out of it."
5918,Tyrion,Tywin,"There are witnesses against you,We shall hear them first."
5919,Tyrion,Tywin,You are to speak only with our leave.
5920,Balon,Tyrion,"Lord  Hand,I had the honor to fight  beside your son on the bridge of ships."
5921,Joffrey,Tyrion,"He did strike His Grace, thats so."
5922,Balon,Joffrey,"The mob near killed us all.In the days of the Targaryens, a man who struck one of the blood royal would lose the hand he struck  him with,Did the dwarf regrow his little hand, or did you White  Swords forget your duty?He was of the blood royal himself,And the Kings Hand beside.No,He was acting Hand, in my stead."
5923,Balon,Tyrion,He knocked the king to the ground and began kicking him.He shouted that it was unjust that His Grace  had escaped unharmed from the mobs.
5924,Joffrey,Sansa,"The dwarf  asked His Grace if he knew what had happened to Aerys Targaryen.When Ser Boros spoke up in  defense of the king, the Imp threatened to have him killed."
5925,Tyrion,Tywin,"Tell the judges what Joffrey was doing, why dont you?"
5926,Tyrion,Tywin,"You told your savages to kill me if I opened my mouth, thats what Ill  tell them.Tyrion,You are to speak only when we call upon you.Take this for a warning."
5927,Osfryd,Osney,"He told Her Grace that he meant to do her harm,To hurt her."
5928,Alayaya,Osney,"He said he would wait for a day when she was happy, and make her joy turn to ashes in her  mouth."
5929,Joffrey,Tyrion,"It was the day they gave  me the white cloak, my lords,That brave boy said to me, Good Ser Osmund, guard  me well, for my uncle loves me not.He means to be king in my place."
5930,Tyrion,Tywin,Liar!
5931,Tyrion,Tywin,Must we have you chained hand and foot like a common brigand?
5932,Cersei,Oberyn,No.
5933,Cersei,Oberyn,"His lies angered me.His truths, you mean,Father, I beg you to put him in fetters, for your own protection.You see how he is.I see hes a dwarf,The day I fear a dwarfs wrath is the day I drown myself in a  cask of red.We need no fetters."
5934,Oberyn,Tywin,The hour grows late.We shall  resume on the morrow.
5935,Tyrion,Varys,"You believe the eunuch will speak in your defense?I wont know until I have talked with him.Send him here, Uncle, if you would be so good.As you wish."
5936,Ballabar,Pycelle,"It was poison that killed him, my lords,"
5937,Ballabar,Pycelle,"Greycap,"
5938,Pycelle,Tyrion,"The Imp Tyrion Lannister stole them from my chambers,  when he had me falsely imprisoned.Pycelle,could any of these poisons choke off a mans  breath?No."
5939,Pycelle,Tyrion,"When I was a boy at the Citadel, my teachers named it  simply the strangler.But this rare poison was not found, was it?No, my lord."
5940,Pycelle,Tyrion,You used it all to kill the noblest child the gods ever put on this  good earth.
5941,Tyrion,Tywin,"Joffrey was cruel and stupid, but I did not kill him.Have my  head off if you like, I had no hand in my nephews death.Silence!"
5942,Pycelle,Tywin,"I have told you thrice.The next time, you shall be gagged and chained."
5943,Kevan,Tyrion,Do  you have witnesses for us?
5944,Kevan,Tyrion,"Not as such, no.Unless youve found my wife."
5945,Kevan,Tyrion,"It would seem the trial is going very badly for you.Oh, do you think so?I hadnt noticed."
5946,Kevan,Tyrion,Varys has not come.Nor will he.On the morrow he testifies against you.
5947,Kevan,Tyrion,I see.
5948,Kevan,Tyrion,I am curious.
5949,Kevan,Tyrion,"What  convinced you?Why steal Pycelles poisons, if not to use them?"
5950,Kevan,Tyrion,And Lady Merryweather saw  - 
5951,Kevan,Tyrion,"How do I prove anything, penned up  here?Perhaps the time has come for you to confess."
5952,Kevan,Tyrion,"Say that  again, Uncle?I could swear you urged me to confess.If you were to admit your guilt before the throne and repent of your crime, your father would withhold  the sword.You would be permitted to take the black."
5953,Kevan,Tyrion,Those were the same terms Cersei offered Eddard Stark.We all know how  that ended.Your father had no part in that.
5954,Kevan,Tyrion,"Castle Black teems with murderers, thieves and rapists,but  I dont recall meeting many regicides while I was there."
5955,Kevan,Tyrion,"Naught was said of forgiveness,A confession would put this matter to rest.It  is for that reason your father sends me with this offer.Thank him kindly for me, Uncle,but tell him I am not presently in a confessing mood.Were I you, Id change my mood.Your sister wants your head, and Lord Tyrell at least is inclined to  give it to her.So one of my judges has already condemned me, without hearing a word in my defense?"
5956,Kevan,Tyrion,"Will I still be allowed to speak and present witnesses?You have no witnesses,Tyrion, if you are guilty of this enormity, the Wall is a  kinder fate than you deserve."
5957,Kevan,Tywin,"Were you so foolish as to venture out into the streets, they would tear you limb  from limb.I can see how much that prospect upsets you.You are my brothers son.You might remind him of that.Do you think he would allow you to take the black if you were not his own blood, and Joannas?"
5958,Kevan,Tyrion,You would  be wise to trust him.
5959,Kevan,Tyrion,"You love him.He is my brother.I ...I will think on what youve said.Think carefully, then.And quickly."
5960,Addam,Tyrion,"Lord Varys,master of whisperers."
5961,Craster,Qhorin,My little birds told me.
5962,Tywin,Varys,Have we heard it all?
5963,Cersei,Varys,"Almost,I beg your leave to bring one final witness before you, on the morrow.As you wish,"
5964,Oberyn,Tyrion,Are judges permitted to visit the accused?Princes are permitted to go where they will.Or so I told your guards.
5965,Oberyn,Tyrion,My father will be displeased with you.The happiness of Tywin Lannister has never been high on my list of concerns.Is it Domish wine youre  drinking?From the Arbor.
5966,Oberyn,Tyrion,Red water.Did you poison him?No.Did you?
5967,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Do all dwarfs have tongues like yours?Someone is going to cut it out one of these  days.You are not the first to tell me that.Perhaps I should cut it out myself, it seems to make no end of  trouble.So Ive seen.I think I may drink some of Lord Redwynes grape juice after all.As you like."
5968,Alayaya,Tyrion,"it will serve, for the moment.I will  send you up some strong Domish wine on the morrow."
5969,Alayaya,Tyrion,I have turned up that  goldenhaired whore I was hoping for.So you found Chatayas?At Chatayas I bedded the black-skinned girl.
5970,Oberyn,Tyrion,But the whore I referred to is your sister.Has she seduced you yet?
5971,Oberyn,Tyrion,"No, but she will if I meet her price."
5972,Oberyn,Tyrion,"All your sister requires from me is one head, somewhat overlarge and missing a  nose.And?"
5973,Craster,Qhorin,
5974,Myrcella,Tyrion,"The kneeling men stood up, and we were free again.I know the tale,What of it?Just this.if I should ever find a sash beside my own bed, and pull on it, I would sooner have the  scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty."
5975,Myrcella,Tyrion,"We have that much in common, then.To be sure, I have much to thank your sister for.if not for her accusation at the feast, it might well be  you judging me instead of me judging you."
5976,Myrcella,Tyrion,"Who knows  more of poison than the Red Viper of Dome, after all?"
5977,Myrcella,Tyrion,"And with Joffrey in his grave, by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to his  sister Myrcella, who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew, thanks to you.Domish law does not apply."
5978,Myrcella,Tyrion,"My father will crown Tommen, count on  that.He may indeed crown Tommen, here in Kings Landing."
5979,Myrcella,Tyrion,Will your sister?
5980,Cersei,Tyrion,"Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all, on the condition that  she support her daughter over her son.Do you think she would?"
5981,Myrcella,Tyrion,"I do not know how my  sister would choose, between Tornmen and Myrcella,It makes no matter.My father will  never give her that choice.Your father,may not live forever."
5982,Elia,Oberyn,"It is not wise to speak such treasons in  the Red Keep, my prince.The little birds are listening.Let them."
5983,Oberyn,Tyrion,And the Doom came and proved it true.
5984,Elia,Tyrion,"It is being said that you have no witnesses for us.I was hoping one look at this sweet face of mine would be enough to persuade you all of my    innocence.You are mistaken, my lord."
5985,Elia,Tyrion,"His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too, as he has reminded  us half a hundred times.And you?"
5986,Elia,Tyrion,Men are seldom as they appear.
5987,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Oh, wait, the bear was at Harrenhal, now I  remember.Is that the game we are playing?"
5988,Amory,Oberyn,"There was a bear at Harrenhal, and it did kill Ser Amory Lorch.How sad for him,And for you.Do all noseless men lie so badly, I wonder?I am not lying."
5989,Amory,Oberyn,"He had some men-at-arms with him, but I do not know their names."
5990,Amory,Oberyn,"It  was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegons head against a wall and raped your sister Elia  with his blood and brains still on his hands.What is this, now?Truth, from a Lannister?"
5991,Amory,Oberyn,"Your father gave the commands,  yes?No."
5992,Oberyn,Tyrion,Such a dutiful son.
5993,Oberyn,Tyrion,It was  Lord Tywin who presented my sisters children to King Robert all wrapped up in crimson Lannister  cloaks.Perhaps you ought to have this discussion with my father.
5994,Jaime,Tyrion,"I was at the Rock, and still so  young that I thought the thing between my legs was only good for pissing.Yes, but you are here now, and in some difficulty, I would say."
5995,Jaime,Tyrion,No more than your father will.
5996,Jaime,Tyrion,But I might.You?
5997,Jaime,Tyrion,You are one judge in three.How could you save me?Not as your judge.As your champion.
5998,Aegon,Barristan,the Bold
5999,Aerys,Robert,Kingslayer.
6000,Arthur,Jaime,"Its  that white sword of yours I want,Then you shall have it, ser,"
6001,Jaime,Osmund,"Ser Jaime,had you looked like this tother night, Id have known you at once.Would you indeed?"
6002,Brienne,Osmund,"Stand by your seat, ser."
6003,Boros,Osmund,"Sers,who guards the king?My brothers Ser Osney and Ser Osfryd,And my brother Ser Garlan,Will they keep him safe?They will, my lord.Be seated, then."
6004,Arthur,Jaime,"How is it that the Kingsguard has  fallen so low,It was my doing, I opened the door, and did nothing  when the vermin began to crawl inside.The king is dead, My sisters son, a boy of thirteen, murdered at his own wedding feast  in his own hall."
6005,Balon,Jaime,And yet hes dead.
6006,Balon,Jaime,Did my brother do this thing?
6007,Balon,Boros,Did Tyrion poison my nephew?
6008,Boros,Meryn,He filled Joffreys cup with wine.That must have been when he  slipped the poison in.You are certain it was the wine that was poisoned?What else?
6009,Boros,Meryn,"The Imp emptied the dregs on the floor.Why, but to spill the wine  that might have proved him guilty?He knew the wine was poisoned,"
6010,Balon,Meryn,The Imp was not alone on the dais.
6011,Jaime,Meryn,No one was watching the wine cup.Who else was on the dais?
6012,Jaime,Meryn,"The kings family, the brides family, Grand Maester Pycelle, the High Septon ."
6013,Jaime,Meryn,".    Theres your poisoner,Too holy by half, that old  man.Never liked the look o him, myself."
6014,Jaime,Meryn,"No,Sansa Stark was the poisoner."
6015,Margaery,Tyrion,"And why did she run afterward, unless she was guilty?"
6016,Jaime,Joffrey,"Whoever did it,"
6017,Boros,Jaime,And not from poison.
6018,Boros,Osmund,"Ser Boros, you look like a man who enjoys his food.Henceforth youll taste everything Tommen eats or  drinks."
6019,Boros,Cersei,"I am no food taster!I am a knight of the Kingsguard!Sad to say, you are."
6020,Boros,Cersei,My sister has told me how readily you yielded my nephew to Tyrions sellswords.
6021,Boros,Jaime,"Try not to let any  sellswords make off with them.You speak to me thus?You?You should have died before you let Tommen be taken.As you died protecting Aerys, ser? "
6022,Boros,Jaime,I  wont ...
6023,Boros,Jaime,What else is a cripple good  for?
6024,Boros,Jaime,I agree.
6025,Boros,Jaime,will be improved.
6026,Boros,Jaime,"Or, if you prefer, you may return to your duties.Bah!"
6027,Boros,Jaime,Ser Osmund.
6028,Jaime,Osmund,"So how is it that I have never heard of you, Ser Osmund?That I couldnt say, my lord."
6029,Jaime,Osmund,"Im a soldier, though, not no tourney  knight.Where had you served, before my sister found you?Here and there, my lord.I have been to Oldtown in the south and Winterfell in the north."
6030,Jaime,Osmund,Nor There.
6031,Jaime,Osmund,I will ask once more.Where have you served?In the Stepstones.
6032,Osmund,Robert,"We fought for Lys, and some for Tyrosh."
6033,Osmund,Robert,"How did you come by your knighthood?On a battlefield.Who knighted you?Ser Robert ... Stone.Hes dead now, my lord.To be sure."
6034,Jaime,Osmund,"Very well, ser,You may go."
6035,Jaime,Meryn,Ser Meryn.
6036,Jaime,Meryn,I  have heard it said that Joffrey made use of you to chastise Sansa Stark.
6037,Jaime,Meryn,"Here, show me where it is in our vows that we swear to beat women and children.I did as His Grace commanded me.We are sworn to obey.Henceforth you will temper that obedience."
6038,Meryn,Tommen,None other.
6039,Meryn,Tommen,Are you telling us not to obey the king?The king is eight.
6040,Jaime,Tommen,"If he tells you  to kill his horse, come to me.Aye.As you command, my lord.Dismissed."
6041,Balon,Jaime,"Ser Balon, I have watched you tilt many a  time, and fought with and against you in melees."
6042,Balon,Jaime,"The Kingsguard is honored by your presence.The honors mine, my lord."
6043,Balon,Jaime,"There is only one question I would put to you.You served us loyally, its true ... but Varys tells me that  your brother rode with Renly and then Stannis, whilst your lord father chose not to call his banners at all  and remained behind the walls of Stonehelm all through the fighting.My father is an old man, my lord."
6044,Balon,Jaime,"His fighting days are done.And your brother?Donnel was wounded in the battle and yielded to Ser Elwood Harte.He was ransomed afterward and  pledged his fealty to King Joffrey, as did many other captives.So he did,Even so ... Renly, Stannis, Joffrey, Tommen how did he come to omit Balon  Greyjoy and Robb Stark?He might have been the first knight in the realm to swear fealty to all six kings."
6045,Balon,Jaime,"Donnel erred, but he is Tommens man now.You have my word.Its not Ser Donnel the Constant who concerns me.Its you."
6046,Balon,Jaime,"What will you do  if brave Ser Donnel gives his sword to yet another usurper, and one day comes storming into the throne  room?"
6047,Balon,Jaime,"What will you do?I ... my lord, that will never happen.It happened to me,"
6048,Balon,Jaime,You have no answer?My lord.
6049,Balon,Jaime,"On my sword, on my honor, on my fathers name, I swear ...I  shall not do as you did."
6050,Balon,Jaime,Good.Return to your duties ... and tell Ser Donnel to add a weathervane to his shield.
6051,Jaime,Tyrion,"Seventeen and a knight of the Kingsguard,You must be proud."
6052,Jaime,Tyrion,"Did you know that? Yes, my lord.And did you know that I was fifteen?That as well, my lord."
6053,Jaime,Tyrion,"I was better than you, Ser Loras.I was bigger, I was stronger, and I was  quicker.And now youre older,My lord."
6054,Jaime,Tyrion,"Older and wiser, ser.You should learn from me.As you learned from Ser Boros and Ser Meryn?"
6055,Jaime,Tyrion,"I learned from the White Bull and Barristan the Bold,I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, who could have slain all five of  you with his left hand while he was taking with a piss with the right.I learned from Prince Lewyn of  Dome and Ser Oswell Whent and Ser Jonothor Darry, good men every one.Dead men, every one."
6056,Jaime,Loras,Its said you fought magnificently in the  battle ... almost as well as Lord Renlys ghost beside you.
6057,Jaime,Loras,Who was wearing Renlys armor?
6058,Jaime,Loras,"My brother,Renly was taller than me, and broader in the chest.His armor was too  loose on me, but it suited Garlan well.Was the masquerade your notion, or his?Lord Petyr suggested it.He said it would frighten Stanniss ignorant men-at-arms.And so it did."
6059,Jaime,Renly,"Well, you gave the singers something to make  rhymes about, I suppose thats not to be despised.What did you do with Renly?I buried him with mine own hands, in a place he showed me once when I was a squire at Storms End.No one shall ever find him there to disturb his rest."
6060,Jaime,Renly,"I will defend King  Tommen with all my strength, I swear it."
6061,Jaime,Renly,He was the best of them.
6062,Loras,Renly,"As you say.One more thing, and you may return to your duties.Yes, my lord?I still have Brienne of Tarth in a tower cell."
6063,Loras,Renly,A black cell would be better.You are certain thats what she deserves?She deserves death.
6064,Loras,Renly,She won the melee  with a trick.I seem to recall another knight who was fond of tricks.
6065,Loras,Renly,What sort of trickery did Brienne use?
6066,Boros,Loras,She leapt ... it makes no matter.
6067,Boros,Loras,"And she killed him, Or let him die.A large difference there."
6068,Jaime,Loras,"Unless they  were part of it.There were five of you at the wedding feast,How could Joffrey die?Unless you  were part of it?"
6069,Loras,Renly,There was nothing we could have done.The wench says the same.
6070,Jaime,Renly,But a shadow? 
6071,Jaime,Loras,"Draw your  sword, Ser Loras."
6072,Jaime,Loras,I should like to see that.
6073,Jaime,Loras,"She fled,She and Catelyn Stark, they left him in his blood  and ran.Why would they, if it was not their work? "
6074,Jaime,Loras,Renly gave me the van.
6075,Brienne,Jaime,Yes?
6076,Jaime,Renly,The gorget was cut through.
6077,Jaime,Renly,And why armor him and then cut his  throat?
6078,Jaime,Renly,"If not her, though ... how could it be a shadow?Ask her."
6079,Jaime,Renly,Go to her cell.
6080,Loras,Renly,"All I ask is that you judge her fairly, on your honor as a knight."
6081,Loras,Renly,"I shall.On my honor.We are done, then."
6082,Brienne,Loras,"Renly thought she was absurd.A  woman dressed in mans mail, pretending to be a knight.If hed ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace, he would not have complained.I asked him why he kept her close, if he thought her so grotesque."
6083,Craster,Qhorin,
6084,Jaime,Loras,"I would have done the same, ser,"
6085,Petyr,Tyrion,"He did nothing,He did not kill Joffrey, true, but the dwarfs hands are far from clean.He had a wife before you, did you  know that?He told me.And did he tell you that when he grew bored with her, he made a gift of her to his fathers guardsmen?"
6086,Petyr,Sansa,"Shed no tears for the Imp, my lady."
6087,Petyr,Sansa,Good morrow.
6088,Petyr,Sansa,It always sharpens my appetite.
6089,Petyr,Sansa,"Are you quite  well?You look so pale.Its only my tummy.The seasickness.A little wine will be good for that.Well get you a cup, as soon as were ashore."
6090,Harren,Petyr,"Cheerful, is it not?"
6091,Harren,Petyr,Well put ashore in a boat.Here?
6092,Harren,Petyr,"Couldnt I stay on the ship until we make sail  for White Harbor? From here the King turns east for Braavos.Without us.But ... my lord, you said... you said we were sailing home.And there it stands, miserable as it is."
6093,Harren,Sansa,It lacks a certain something.
6094,Harren,Sansa,You look  distraught.
6095,Catelyn,Sansa,"Youre a woman grown, and you need to make your  own home.But not here,It looks so."
6096,Catelyn,Sansa,.
6097,Catelyn,Sansa,I expect your aunt is already riding to meet us.
6098,Catelyn,Sansa,The Lady Lysa  and I are to be wed.Wed?
6099,Catelyn,Sansa,You and my aunt?The Lord of Harrenhal and the Lady of the Eyrie.
6100,Petyr,Sansa,"So silent, my lady?"
6101,Petyr,Sansa,"I was certain you would wish to give me your blessing.It is a rare thing  for a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets to wed the daughter of Hoster Tully and the widow of Jon  Arryn.I ...I pray you will have long years together, and many children, and be very happy in one another."
6102,Petyr,Sansa,"My household,I dont know the child."
6103,Petyr,Sansa,She pops one out every few years.
6104,Lothor,Petyr,"Who fathered this one, Kella? "
6105,Lothor,Petyr,"I cant rightly say, mlord.Im not one for telling them no.And all the local lads are grateful, I am quite sure.It is good to have you home, my lord,"
6106,Petyr,Sansa,"How long will you be in residence?As short a time as possible, Bryen, have no fear.Is the place habitable just now, would you say?If we knew you was coming we would have laid down fresh rushes, mlord,Theres a  dung fire burning.Nothing says home like the smell of burning dung."
6107,Petyr,Sansa,"Grisel was my wet nurse,  but she keeps my castle now.Umfreds my steward, and Bryen - didnt I name you captain of the guard    the last time  was here?You did, my lord."
6108,Petyr,Sansa,"Me and the dogs  stand all the watches.And very well, Im sure.No one has made off with any of my rocks or sheep pellets, I see that plainly."
6109,Petyr,Sansa,"Kella minds my vast herds.How many sheep do I have at  present, Kella?"
6110,Petyr,Sansa,"Three and twenty, mlord.There was nine and twenty, but Bryens dogs  killed one and we butchered some others and salted down the meat.Ah, cold salt mutton."
6111,Petyr,Sansa,"When I break my fast on gulls eggs and seaweed soup, Ill be  certain of it.If you like, mlord,"
6112,Petyr,Sansa,"Come, lets see if my hall is as dreary as I recall."
6113,Petyr,Sansa,"My grandfathers shield,His own father  was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray, so my grandfather  took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted.Its very fierce,Rather too fierce, for an amiable fellow like me,I much prefer my mockingbird."
6114,Petyr,Sansa,"Here, my lady, that should  help your tummy, I would hope."
6115,Petyr,Sansa,"Grisel,"
6116,Petyr,Sansa,"Oswells brought some  oranges and pomegranates from the King.Yes, mlord.Might I have a hot bath as well?"
6117,Petyr,Sansa,"Ill have Kella draw some water, mlady."
6118,Craster,Qhorin,Lysa will not come alone.
6119,Catelyn,Sansa,So we shall tell Lysas people that you are my natural daughter.Natural?
6120,Catelyn,Sansa,"You mean, a bastard?Well, you can scarcely be my trueborn daughter."
6121,Catelyn,Sansa,What  should you be called?I ...  
6122,Catelyn,Sansa,Do you like it?Alayne is pretty.
6123,Catelyn,Sansa,But couldnt I be the trueborn daughter of some  knight in your service?
6124,Catelyn,Sansa,".I have no gallant knights in my service, Alayne."
6125,Catelyn,Sansa,"It is rude to pry into the origins of a mans natural children, however."
6126,Catelyn,Sansa,"So, who are you?Alayne ... Stone, would it be?But who is my mother?Kella?Please no,I was teasing."
6127,Petyr,Sansa,That was the first I knew of your existence.
6128,Petyr,Sansa,"Do you think you  can remember all that?I hope.It will be like playing a game, wont it?Are you fond of games, Alayne?"
6129,Petyr,Sansa,Games?
6130,Craster,Qhorin,
6131,Petyr,Sansa,"You should try and eat, my lady.Thank you, my lord."
6132,Petyr,Sansa,"You must miss your father terribly, I know.Lord Eddard was a brave man, honest and loyal ... but quite a hopeless player."
6133,Petyr,Sansa,"In Kings Landing, there are two sorts of people.The players and the pieces.And I was a piece?"
6134,Petyr,Sansa,"Yes, but dont let that trouble you."
6135,Petyr,Sansa,Even some who think they are players.
6136,Dontos,Petyr,"Cersei, for one."
6137,Dontos,Petyr,"And when you know what  a man wants you know who he is, and how to move him.As you moved Ser Dontos to poison Joffrey?"
6138,Dontos,Petyr,Ser Dontos the Red was a skin of wine with legs.
6139,Dontos,Petyr,and make certain you wore your silver hair net.
6140,Dontos,Petyr,"But... if not Dontos, who?"
6141,Dontos,Petyr,"pieces?You could turn Kings Landing upside down and not find a single man with a mockingbird sewn over his  heart, but that does not mean I am friendless."
6142,Petyr,Sansa,"Oswell, come up here and let the  Lady Sansa have a look at you."
6143,Petyr,Sansa,What am  I supposed to see?Do you know him?
6144,Petyr,Sansa,No.Look closer.
6145,Oswell,Sansa,"I dont.I never saw Oswell before I  got into his boat, Im certain."
6146,Oswell,Sansa,"No, but mlady might of met my three sons.three sons,Kettleblack!"
6147,Petyr,Sansa,"Youre a  Kettleblack!Aye, mlady, as it please you.Shes beside herself with joy."
6148,Oswell,Petyr,"Tell me, Alayne - which is more dangerous, the dagger  brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one pressed to your back by someone you never even see?The hidden dagger.Theres a clever girl."
6149,Osmund,Oswell,"When the Imp  sent off her guards, the queen had Ser Lancel hire sellswords for her.Lancel found her the Kettleblacks,  which delighted your little lord husband, since the lads were in his pay through his man Bronn."
6150,Osmund,Petyr,"But it was me who told Oswell to get his sons to Kings Landing when I learned that Bronn  was looking for swords.Three hidden daggers, Alayne, now perfectly placed.So one of the Kettleblacks put the poison in Joffrey s cup?"
6151,Osmund,Petyr,Did I say that?
6152,Petyr,Sansa,The  lads are far too treacherous to be part of any such scheme ... and Osmund has become especially  unreliable since he joined the Kingsguard.
6153,Petyr,Sansa,Even a man like  him.
6154,Petyr,Sansa,"I love  the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers,Clean hands, Sansa.Whatever  you do, make certain your hands are clean."
6155,Petyr,Sansa,"But if it wasnt the Kettleblacks and it wasnt Ser  Dontos ... you werent even in the city, and it couldnt have been Tyrion ."
6156,Petyr,Sansa,"No more guesses, sweetling?"
6157,Petyr,Sansa,I dont .
6158,Petyr,Sansa,I will wager you that at some point during the evening someone told you that your hair net  was crooked and straightened it for you.
6159,Sansa,Willas,"You cannot mean ... she wanted to take me to Highgarden, to marry  me to her grandson..."
6160,Joffrey,Lollys,I also planted the notion of Ser Loras taking the white.
6161,Aemon,Lollys,Mace Tyrell actually thought it was his own idea to make Ser Lorass inclusion in the Kingsguard part of  the marriage contract.
6162,Loras,Olenna,Be that as it may.
6163,Margaery,Tommen,"The great western alliance will be preserved ...  for a time, at least."
6164,Chett,Petyr,"Mine own smallfolk,"
6165,Chett,Petyr,"Hes dead now, but when I was a boy my father took me to see him."
6166,Chett,Petyr,"He groped me a bit and said I would be a great man, and for that my father gave him a skin of wine."
6167,Chett,Petyr,I would have told him the same thing for half a cup.
6168,Lysa,Petyr,"Lysa,Come,  Alayne, let us greet her."
6169,Lysa,Petyr,"The kings small council commanded me to woo and win you, my lady.Do you think you might have me for your lord and husband?"
6170,Petyr,Sansa,"Oh, mayhaps I could be  persuaded."
6171,Petyr,Sansa,"Have you brought gifts to melt my heart?The kings peace.Oh, poo to the peace, what else have you brought me?My daughter."
6172,Lysa,Sansa,"My lady, allow me to present you  Alayne Stone."
6173,Petyr,Sansa,A  bastard?
6174,Petyr,Sansa,"Petyr, have you been wicked?Who was her mother?The wench is dead.Id hoped to take Alayne to the Eyrie.What am I to do with her there?I have a few notions,But just now I am more interested in what I might do with you,  my lady."
6175,Lysa,Yohn,"Sweet Petyr, Ive missed you so, you dont know, you cant know."
6176,Lysa,Petyr,"Ive dreamed of you so long.And I of you, my lady."
6177,Lysa,Petyr,"How soon can  we be wed?Now,Ive brought my own septon, and a singer, and mead for the wedding  feast.Here?"
6178,Lysa,Petyr,"Id sooner wed you at the Eyrie, with your whole court in attendance.Poo to my court.I have waited so long, I could not bear to wait another moment."
6179,Lysa,Petyr,"I want to share your bed tonight, my sweet.I want us to make another child, a brother for  Robert or a sweet little daughter.I dream of that as well, sweetling.  "
6180,Lysa,Petyr,"I want you now, this very night."
6181,Lysa,Petyr,"I am going to scream so loud theyll hear  me in the Eyrie!Perhaps I could bed you now, and wed you later?"
6182,Lysa,Petyr,"Oh, Petyr Baelish, you are so wicked.No, I say no, I am the Lady of  the Eyrie, and I command you to wed me this very moment!"
6183,Lysa,Petyr,"As my lady commands, then.I am helpless before you, as ever."
6184,Lysa,Sansa,The Vow UnspokenSeasons of My LoveTwo Hearts That Beat as One.
6185,Lysa,Petyr,"Petyr,Oh, Petyr, Petyr, sweet  Petyr, oh oh oh."
6186,Lysa,Petyr,"Thats where you belong.Miladys Supper,Make me a baby, Petyr,make me another sweet little baby."
6187,Marillion,Sansa,"You sad old hound,Alayne."
6188,Marillion,Sansa,Sweet Alayne.
6189,Marillion,Sansa,Let me warm you.
6190,Marillion,Sansa,Marillion?
6191,Marillion,Sansa,"You are ... kind to think of me, but ... pray forgive me.I am very tired.And very beautiful."
6192,Marillion,Sansa,"They were poor things, unworthy of  such beauty."
6193,Marillion,Sansa,Let me sing to you with my body instead.
6194,Marillion,Sansa,Youre drunk.I never get drunk.
6195,Chett,Sansa,I am on fire.
6196,Chett,Sansa,And  you as well.Unhand me.You forget yourself.Mercy.
6197,Chett,Sansa,"Are you wet for me?Im a maiden,Truly?"
6198,Marillion,Sansa,Ill have you singing louder than the Lady Lysa.
6199,Marillion,Sansa,"If you dont leave me, my au - my father will hang you.Lord  Petyr.Petyr?"
6200,Marillion,Sansa,"Lady Lysa loves me well, and I am Lord Roberts favorite.If your father  offends me, I will destroy him with a verse."
6201,Marillion,Sansa,Lets get you  out of these wet clothes.
6202,Craster,Qhorin,"  Sansa heard the soft sound of steel on leather. a rough voice said, "
6203,Marillion,Sansa,"Find your own wench - You cut me!Ill do worse, if you dont go."
6204,Lothor,Sansa,Lord Petyr said watch out for you.
6205,Sansa,Tyrion,"Ill have a song from you,I wish that you were Lady,"
6206,Petyr,Sansa,"Your aunt wishes to speak with you,Ive told her who you are."
6207,Petyr,Sansa,"I ...I thank you, my lord."
6208,Petyr,Sansa,Ive had about as much home as I can stomach.Well leave for the  Eyrie this afternoon.
6209,Lysa,Sansa,"I see it now,You look so much like Catelyn.Its kind of you to say so.It was not meant as flattery."
6210,Catelyn,Lysa,"We shall darken your hair before we bring you back to the Eyrie, I think."
6211,Catelyn,Lysa,"If it please you, Aunt Lysa.You must not call me that."
6212,Catelyn,Lysa,I  do not mean to have my son endangered.
6213,Catelyn,Lysa,I have kept the Vale  out of this war.
6214,Jon,Lysa,"Even so, it would not do to draw Lord Tywins wroth down upon us."
6215,Jon,Lysa,"You were wed to Tyrion Lannister, Petyr says.That vile dwarf.They made me marry him.I never wanted it. her aunt said."
6216,Lysa,Sansa,"So you  see, I have suffered too."
6217,Lysa,Sansa,"You do know that your poor mother is dead?Tyrion told me,He said the Freys murdered her at The Twins, with Robb."
6218,Lysa,Sansa,"We are women alone now, you and I."
6219,Lysa,Sansa,We are bound by blood.
6220,Lysa,Sansa,"You may come kiss my cheek, Alayne."
6221,Lysa,Sansa,"Now tell me,Are you with  child?The truth now, I will know if you lie.No,You are a woman flowered, are you not?Yes."
6222,Lysa,Sansa,Tyrion didnt ... he  never...I am still a maid.Was the dwarf incapable?No.
6223,Lysa,Vardis,"He ... he had whores, my lady.He told me so.Whores."
6224,Lysa,Vardis,Of course he did.
6225,Lysa,Petyr,I shall make him Lord Protector of the Vale.
6226,Lysa,Robert,"He may not look as tall or strong as some, but he is worth more than all of them.Trust in him and do as  he says.I shall, Aunt ... my lady."
6227,Lysa,Robert,I knew that boy Joffrey.
6228,Lysa,Sansa,"Youll know that, when you have a child.A child?"
6229,Lysa,Sansa,Not for many years.
6230,Lysa,Sansa,"just as you will want to marry.I ...I am married, my lady.Yes, but soon a widow."
6231,Robert,Sansa,"It would not be fitting for my son to take    that dwarfs leavings, but as he never touched you ... How would you like to marry your cousin, the Lord  Robert? "
6232,Robert,Sansa,"I ... can scarcely wait to meet him, my lady.But he is still a child, is he not?He is eight."
6233,Lysa,Robert,"Do you read well, Alayne? Septa Mordane was good enough to say so. Lady Lysa confided."
6234,Chett,Jon,My son will have a  grateful and obedient wife.
6235,Jon,Owen,"Lord Snow,the dawn."
6236,Jon,Owen,"I had a dream that the king had come,Maester Aemon sent a raven, and King  Robert came with all his strength.I dreamed I saw his golden banners."
6237,Jon,Owen,"That would be a welcome sight to see, Owen."
6238,Alyn,Jon,"Here come our breakfast  arrows,"
6239,Grenn,Jon,"It makes it seem as if theres more of us,More of us with arrows in our bellies,"
6240,Grenn,Jon,"Its done, isnt it?"
6241,Grenn,Jon,Near enough.
6242,Grenn,Jon,"It will come today, most like.Did you fill the barrels?Every one.They froze hard during the night, Pyp checked."
6243,Grenn,Jon,I heard their axes all night.Couldnt sleep for all the chopping.Then go sleep now.I dont need - 
6244,Grenn,Jon,"Go on, Im not going to let you sleep through the fight."
6245,Grenn,Jon,Youre the only one who can move those bloody barrels.
6246,Jon,Satin,ITS COMING!it
6247,Jon,Satin,"It doesnt really look much like a turtle,Turtles  dont have fur.Most of them dont have wheels either,Sound the warhorn,"
6248,Jon,Spare,"Its big,"
6249,Jon,Spare,Think of all the soup it will make.
6250,Kegs,Spare,"Owen, Horse, to the catapults."
6251,Jon,Spare,Lets see if we can  burn it.
6252,Jon,Owen,"Scorpions,Catapults."
6253,Jon,Owen,"Jon, its still coming,"
6254,Craster,Qhorin,Four for Watt of Long Lake!
6255,Chett,Jon,Fie!
6256,Chett,Jon,"Im not in  the tourney! The hides wont burn,"
6257,Chett,Jon,"Grenn, Owen, Kegs, its time."
6258,Grenn,Jon,Why do we need to freeze it?
6259,Grenn,Jon,"Why dont we just roll the barrels off the way  they are?If they crash against the Wall on the way down theyll burst, and loose gravel will spray  everywhere."
6260,Grenn,Jon,"The bugger weighs a ton,Tip it over and roll it,Careful, if it rolls over your foot youll end up like Spare Boot."
6261,Jon,Mully,Theres a turtle at  our door!
6262,Grenn,Jon,"You shouldnt lean out like that,We should have built hoardings."
6263,Grenn,Owen,Do it.
6264,Craster,Qhorin,The turtle was stuffed  full of rabbits!
6265,Aemon,Grenn,"I am going down to the Kings Tower,Call me if Mance gets up to anything.Pyp, you have the Wall.Me?"
6266,Aemon,Grenn,Him?
6267,Jon,Mance,"Jon Snow,pull on your boots and come with us."
6268,Jon,Mance,Come where?Who are  you?
6269,Craster,Qhorin,"Heres the tumcloak now, my lord. Jon said coldly."
6270,Alliser,Jon,"Yes, we shall see,You will not deny that you are Jon  Snow, I hope?Starks bastard?Lord Snow, he likes to call himself."
6271,Alliser,Jon,"Youre the one who named me Lord Snow,"
6272,Cotter,Jon,How many men have you brought?
6273,Cotter,Jon,"Its me wholl ask the questions,Youve been charged with oathbreaking,  cowardice, and desertion, Jon Snow.Do you deny that you abandoned your brothers to die on the Fist  of the First Men and joined the wildling Mance Rayder, this self-styled King-beyondthe-Wall? Abandoned ...?"
6274,Aemon,Jon,"My lord, Donal Noye and I discussed these issues when Jon Snow  first returned to us, and were satisfied by Jons explanations.Well, I am not satisfied, Maester,I will hear these explanations for myself.Yes I  will!"
6275,Jon,Qhorin,I abandoned no one.
6276,Alliser,Mance,  
6277,Alliser,Janos,"Were you commanded to count their snarks as well, Lord  Snow?No, but I counted their giants as best I could.Ser,You will address Ser Alliser as ser, and myself as mlord."
6278,Bowen,Jon,I will not suffer to hear an anointed knight like the  good Ser Alliser mocked by a traitors bastard.
6279,Jon,Ygritte,Do you deny that you took a wildling woman into your bed?No.
6280,Alliser,Ygritte,"No, my lord.I suppose it was also the Halfhand who commanded you to fuck this unwashed whore?"
6281,Alliser,Ygritte,Ser.
6282,Alliser,Janos,"I will not deny that I went beyond what I had to do, that I ... cared for her.You admit to being an oathbreaker, then,"
6283,Jon,Ygritte,I  broke my vows with a woman.
6284,Jon,Ygritte,"Yes.Yes, mlord!"
6285,Jon,Ygritte,"Yes, my lord,I rode with the wildlings and ate with them, as the Halfhand commanded me,  and I shared my furs with Ygritte."
6286,Jon,Ygritte,"I escaped the Magnar as  soon as I could, and never took up arms against my brothers or the realm."
6287,Jon,Ygritte,"Ser Glendon,bring in the other prisoner."
6288,Jon,Rattleshirt,Is this the  one you spoke of?
6289,Jon,Rattleshirt,Aye.
6290,Jon,Rattleshirt,"Aye,"
6291,Janos,Jon,"The Halfhand swore hed see the craven dead first, but the wolf ripped Qhorin half t pieces and this  one opened his throat."
6292,Janos,Jon,Well?
6293,Janos,Jon,Do you deny it?Or will you claim Qhorin commanded  you to kill him?He told me...He told me to do whatever they asked of me.
6294,Alliser,Rattleshirt,"Does this boy think I fell off a turnip wagon  onto my head?Your lies wont save you now, Lord Snow,Well have the truth from you,  bastard.Ive told you the truth."
6295,Qhorin,Rattleshirt,"Rattleshirt was going to kill him anyway, he knew that too.So now you claim the great Qhorin Halfhand feared this creature?"
6296,Jon,Rattleshirt,"All men fear the Lord o Bones,"
6297,Alliser,Jon,"I never said that,"
6298,Alliser,Jon,I heard you!
6299,Alliser,Janos,"Did you think my  skull was stuffed with cabbage?I dont know what your skull is stuffed with.My lord.Lord Snow is nothing if not arrogant,He murdered Qhorin just as his fellow  turncloaks did Lord Mormont."
6300,Janos,Mance,"You know these Starks, my lord.I do,I know them too well."
6301,Alliser,Jon,I burned my hand defending Lord Mormont  from a wight.
6302,Alliser,Cellador,He would never have betrayed his vows.No more than you?
6303,Alliser,Cellador,"Lord Slynt,this boy refused to swear his vows properly in  the sept, but went beyond the Wall to say his words before a heart tree."
6304,Aemon,Mance,"My lords, when  Donal Noye was slain, it was this young man Jon Snow who took the Wall and held it, against all the fury  of the north."
6305,Jon,Qhorin, 
6306,Jon,Qhorin,"Well, promise may turn false."
6307,Jon,Qhorin,And I know the ways of wolves as well.
6308,Jon,Qhorin,Your father died a traitor.My father was murdered.
6309,Alliser,Jon,Murder?
6310,Alliser,Jon,King Robert was not even cold when Lord Eddard moved  against his son.
6311,Alliser,Jon,"Your  father died by the sword, but he was highborn, a Kings Hand."
6312,Alliser,Jon,"Ser Alliser,  take this tumcloak to an ice cell.My lord is wise."
6313,Alliser,Jon,"You see for yourselves, brothers.The boy is a  wildling."
6314,Addam,Podrick,"Yes, I did it, I confess."
6315,Addam,Podrick,My lord?
6316,Addam,Podrick,"Theyre here, my lord."
6317,Addam,Podrick,"They wait  without.Pod, tell me true ... do you think I did it?"
6318,Addam,Tyrion,No need to answer.
6319,Addam,Tyrion,"Whatever happens, I thank you for your leal service."
6320,Sansa,Shae,"They plotted it together,The Imp and Lady Sansa plotted it after the  Young Wolf died."
6321,Oberyn,Tommen,"But  after a year or so, before Tornmen got too old, he would have killed him too, so as to take the crown for  his own head.How could you know all this?"
6322,Oberyn,Tommen,"Why would the Imp divulge such plans to  his wifes maid?I overheard some, mlord,"
6323,Shagga,Timett,He said that  poor boy Joffrey would never know his bride the way he was knowing me.
6324,Shagga,Timett,"I  never meant to be a whore, mlords."
6325,Oberyn,Shae,. 
6326,Oberyn,Shae,What sorts of things?Unspeakable things.
6327,Boros,Shae,"With my mouth and ... other parts, mlord."
6328,Boros,Meryn,"My giant, I  had to call him, my giant of Lannister."
6329,Loras,Shae,"Its true,My giant of Lannister."
6330,Tyrion,Tywin,MY LORDS!
6331,Shae,Tywin,"Get this lying whore out of my sight,and I will give you your confession."
6332,Mace,Tywin,"Guilty,so  guilty."
6333,Oberyn,Tyrion,"You admit  you poisoned the king?Nothing of the sort,Of Joffreys death I am innocent.I am guilty of a more monstrous  crime."
6334,Tyrion,Tywin,I was born.
6335,Tyrion,Tywin,"And no matter how many times my good father forgave me, I have persisted in my infamy.This is folly, Tyrion,Speak to the matter at hand.You are not on trial for being  a dwarf.That is where you err, my lord.I have been on trial for being a dwarf my entire life.Have you nothing to say in your defense?Nothing but this: I did not do it.Yet now I wish I had."
6336,Tyrion,Tywin,I wish I had enough poison for you all.
6337,Gregor,Joffrey,I demand trial by battle.Have you taken leave of your wits?
6338,Gregor,Joffrey,"No, Ive found them.I demand trial by battle!"
6339,Gregor,Joffrey,"He has that right, my lords,Let the gods judge."
6340,Joffrey,Tywin,"He returned to the city the night  before last, to put his sword at my service."
6341,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Do you have a champion to defend your innocence?He does, my lord."
6342,Oberyn,Tyrion,The dwarf has quite convinced me.
6343,Kevan,Tywin,"Let the issue be decided on the  morrow,I wash my hands of it."
6344,Symon,Tyrion,"For hands of gold are always cold,  but a womans hands are warm,"
6345,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Good morrow to you, my lord,Will you take a  cup of wine? Should you be drinking before battle?I always drink before battle.That could get you killed.Worse, it could get me killed."
6346,Oberyn,Tyrion,"The gods defend the innocent.You are innocent, I trust?Only of killing Joffrey,I do hope you know what you are about to face. - large?"
6347,Oberyn,Tyrion,"His armor is so heavy that no lesser man could bear the weight, let alone move in it."
6348,Oberyn,Tyrion,I have killed large men before.
6349,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Once they go down, theyre dead.Daemon, my spear!"
6350,Daemon,Tyrion,You mean to face the Mountain with a spear?
6351,Daemon,Tyrion,We are fond of spears in Dome.
6352,Oberyn,Tyrion,"Have a look, Lord  Imp, but see you do not touch."
6353,Gregor,Tyrion,"I hope you  are good with that,You will have no cause for complaint."
6354,Gregor,Sansa,"I will find a place to tickle him, I  promise you."
6355,Gregor,Sansa,It is said that a Lannister always pays his debts.
6356,Sansa,Tyrion,"My brother Doran would be most  pleased to meet the rightful heir to Casterly Rock ... especially if he brought his lovely wife, the Lady of  Winterfell."
6357,Oberyn,Tyrion,"A trip to Dome might be very pleasant, now that I reflect on it.Plan on a lengthy visit."
6358,Oberyn,Tyrion,You and Doran have many matters of mutual  interest to discuss.
6359,Oberyn,Varys,No doubt an uncles counsel would be of benefit to Queen Myrcella in the trying times  ahead.
6360,Myrcella,Tyrion,"I believe I will have that cup  of wine,"
6361,Cersei,Oberyn,"Do you recall the tale I told you of our first meeting, Imp?"
6362,Cersei,Oberyn,It was not for your  tail alone that my sister and I came to Casterly Rock.
6363,Baelor,Doran,Elia found it all exciting.
6364,Baelor,Tyrion,"I was a monstrous young fellow, someone should have sliced  out my vile tongue."
6365,Arron,Oberyn,"Lannisport was the end of our voyage,Were you aware that our mothers knew each  other of old? They had been at court together as girls, I seem to recall.Companions to Princess Rhaella?Just so."
6366,Arron,Elia,The main course was to be served at Casterly Rock.Cersei and Jaime.Such a clever dwarf.
6367,Cersei,Oberyn,"Perhaps both.Perhaps,but my father - "
6368,Cersei,Oberyn,"At Oldtown we learned of your mothers death, and the monstrous  child she had borne."
6369,Tyrion,Tywin,"What I did not tell you was that my mother waited as long as was decent, and then broached your  father about our purpose."
6370,Tyrion,Tywin,"And when she asked for Jaime,  to espouse Elia, he offered her you instead.Which offer she took for an outrage.It was.Even you can see that, surely?Oh, surely."
6371,Tyrion,Tywin,"Well, Prince Rhaegar married Elia of Dome,  not Cersei Lannister of Casterly Rock.So it would seem your mother won that tilt.She thought so,"
6372,Oberyn,Tyrion,"My helm, Dagos."
6373,Oberyn,Tyrion,Elia and her  children have waited long for justice.
6374,Oberyn,Tyrion,But this day they shall have it.
6375,Ellaria,Oberyn,You are  going to fight that?
6376,Ellaria,Tyrion,"I am going to kill that,"
6377,Gregor,Tyrion,Have they told you who I am?
6378,Gregor,Oberyn,Some dead man.
6379,Gregor,Oberyn,"I am Oberyn Martell, a prince of Dome,Princess Elia was my sister.Who?"
6380,Gregor,Oberyn,"Elia Martell, Princess of Dome,You raped her."
6381,Gregor,Oberyn,You killed her children.
6382,Gregor,Oberyn,You raped her.
6383,Gregor,Oberyn,You killed her children.Did you come to talk or to fight?I came to hear you confess.
6384,Gregor,Oberyn,"You raped her,You murdered her,You killed her children,Oberyn is toying with him,"
6385,Ellaria,Tyrion,Gregor is too bloody big to be any mans toy.
6386,Gregor,Oberyn,You raped her.
6387,Gregor,Oberyn,You murdered her.
6388,Gregor,Oberyn,You killed her children.
6389,Gregor,Oberyn,You raped her.
6390,Gregor,Oberyn,You killed her children.
6391,Gregor,Oberyn,You raped her.
6392,Gregor,Oberyn,You killed her children.
6393,Gregor,Oberyn,You raped her.
6394,Gregor,Oberyn,You killed her children.Be quiet.
6395,Gregor,Oberyn,"Shut your bloody mouth.You raped her,Enough!"
6396,Gregor,Oberyn,"You murdered her,SHUT UP"
6397,Gregor,Oberyn,Shut UP!
6398,Gregor,Tyrion,"Elia,You raped her."
6399,Gregor,Tyrion,Now say her name.
6400,Gregor,Tyrion,"You talk too much,You make my head hurt.I will hear you say it.She was Elia of Dome."
6401,Elia,Gregor,Elia.
6402,Elia,Tyrion,of Dome!
6403,Elia,Tyrion,Say it!
6404,Gregor,Oberyn,ELIA OF DORNE!
6405,Cersei,Oberyn,EEEEELLLLLLIIIIIAAAAA!
6406,Gregor,Oberyn,"If you die  before you say her name, ser, I will hunt you through all seven hells,"
6407,Ellaria,Tyrion,"I am feeling more innocent by the instant,"
6408,Ellaria,Oberyn,Say the name!
6409,Gregor,Tyrion,"Elia of Dorne,"
6410,Gregor,Oberyn,I killed her screaming whelp.
6411,Gregor,Oberyn,Then I raped her.
6412,Ellaria,Oberyn,Then I smashed her fucking  head in.Like this.
6413,Daenerys,Tyrion,"Ive been consigned to the black cells,"
6414,Daenerys,Missandei,"I must remember to do  something about the flies,Are there many flies on Naath, Missandei?On Naath there are butterflies,More wine?No.I must hold court soon."
6415,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am going to take you home one day,  Missandei,"
6416,Daenerys,Jorah,"I  swear it.This one is content to stay with you, Your Grace."
6417,Daenerys,Jhiqui,You are good to this - to  me.And you to me.
6418,Jhiqui,Missandei,Come help me dress.
6419,Chett,Daenerys,Mother.
6420,Chett,Daenerys,"I want  your leaders,Give them up, and the rest of you shall be spared.How many?"
6421,Chett,Daenerys,"How many must you have to spare us?One hundred and sixty-three,"
6422,Chett,Daenerys,"I will not sit in the harpys lap,"
6423,Aegon,Daenerys,Was the night as quiet as it seemed?
6424,Aegon,Daenerys,"It seems it was, Your Grace,"
6425,Daario,Daenerys,There are too many  flies in this city.
6426,Daario,Daenerys,There were flies in my ale this morning.I swallowed one of them.Flies are the dead mans revenge.
6427,Daario,Daenerys,"Corpses  breed maggots, and maggots breed flies.We will rid ourselves of the corpses, then."
6428,Daario,Daenerys,"Grey Worm, will you  see to it?The queen commands, these ones obey.Best bring sacks as well as shovels, Worm,Well past ripe, those ones."
6429,Daario,Daenerys,. He knows.
6430,Daario,Daenerys,"Your Grace,Ghiscari inter their honored dead in crypts below their manses."
6431,Daario,Daenerys,Let it be done.
6432,Daario,Daenerys,How many seek  audience this morning?Two have presented themselves to bask in your radiance.
6433,Daario,Daenerys,"They arrived in the night on the Indigo Star, a  trading galley out of Qarth."
6434,Daario,Daenerys,Who are they?The Stars master and one who claims to speak for Astapor.I will see the envoy first.
6435,Daenerys,Missandei,Your Worship!
6436,Daenerys,Missandei,"My name is Ghael.I bring greetings to the Mother of Dragons from  King Cleon of Astapor, Cleon the Great."
6437,Daenerys,Missandei,"I left a council to rule Astapor.A healer, a scholar, and a priest.Your Worship, those sly rogues betrayed your trust."
6438,Daenerys,Missandei,"Great Cleon exposed their plots and hacked their  heads off with a cleaver, and the grateful folk of Astapor have crowned him for his valor.Noble Ghael,is this the same Cleon once owned by  Grazdan mo Ullhor?"
6439,Daenerys,Missandei,"The same,A  great man."
6440,Daenerys,Missandei,"He was a butcher in Grazdans kitchen,It was said he could slaughter a pig faster than any man in Astapor."
6441,Cleon,Ghael,I will  pray that King Cleon rules well and wisely.What would he have of me?
6442,Cleon,Ghael,"Perhaps we should speak more privily, Your Grace?I have no secrets from my captains and commanders.As you wish."
6443,Cleon,Daenerys,"He proposes a pact  between Astapor and Meereen, against the Yunkaii.I swore no harm would come to Yunkai if they released their slaves,These Yunkish dogs cannot be trusted, Your Worship."
6444,Daenerys,Ghael,"To prove his faith, Great Cleon offers to seal your  alliance with a marriage.A marriage?To me?"
6445,Daenerys,Ghael,Great Cleon will give you many strong sons.
6446,Daenerys,Missandei,Did his first wife give him  sons?
6447,Daenerys,Missandei,Great Cleon has three daughters by his first wife.
6448,Daenerys,Ghael,"But he means to put all of them aside if the Mother of Dragons will consent to wed  him.How noble of him,I will consider all youve said, my lord."
6449,Daenerys,Jorah,"I shall see this trader captain,"
6450,Daenerys,Jorah,The city bleeds.
6451,Daenerys,Jorah,"King    Cleavers thugs have seized every highborn boy in Astapor to make new Unsullied for the trade, though it  will be years before they are trained."
6452,Daario,Daenerys,"What do you want of me, Captain?Slaves,My holds are full to bursting with ivory, ambergris,  zorse hides, and other fine goods.We have no slaves for sale,My queen?"
6453,Daario,Daenerys,"The riverside is full of Meereenese, begging leave to be allowed  to sell themselves to this Qartheen.They are thicker than the flies."
6454,Daario,Daenerys,"They want to be slaves?The ones who come are well spoken and gently born, sweet queen."
6455,Daenerys,Missandei,"Here they have lost all, and live in fear and squalor.I see."
6456,Daenerys,Missandei,Any man who wishes to sell himself into slavery may do so.Or woman.
6457,Daenerys,Missandei,"But they  may not sell their children, nor a man his wife.In Astapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed hands,Well do the same,"
6458,Daario,Daenerys,A tenth part.
6459,Daario,Daenerys,"Meereen has no need of saffron, cloves, or zorse hides.It shall be done as you command, glorious queen,My Stormcrows will collect your  tenth."
6460,Daario,Daenerys,"Records must be kept,Seek among the freedmen for men who can read, write, and do  sums."
6461,Belwas,Daenerys,"Tell Belwas to bring my knights,My good knights."
6462,Belwas,Jorah,Khaleesi...
6463,Belwas,Jorah,Be quiet.I will tell you when to speak.
6464,Belwas,Jorah,"When I sent you down into the sewers, part of me hoped Id seen the last of you."
6465,Jorah,Viserys,My brother would have  hanged you both.
6466,Jorah,Viserys,"I  will admit you helped win me this city...We won you this city.We sewer rats.Be quiet,"
6467,Barristan,Belwas,"You helped win this city,And you have served me well in the past."
6468,Barristan,Robert,"Ser Jorah saved me  from the poisoner in Vaes Dothrak, and again from Drogos bloodriders after my sun-and-stars had  died."
6469,Barristan,Robert,"And yet you lied, deceived me,  betrayed me."
6470,Barristan,Robert,"You protected my father for many years, fought beside  my brother on the Trident, but you abandoned Viserys in his exile and bent your knee to the Usurper  instead."
6471,Barristan,Robert,And tell it true.Some truths are hard to hear.
6472,Daenerys,Viserys,"even as a child, your brother Viserys oft  seemed to be his fathers son, in ways that Rhaegar never did.His fathers son?"
6473,Daenerys,Viserys,What does that mean?
6474,Daenerys,Viserys,Your father is called the Mad King in Westeros.Has no one ever told  you?Viserys did.
6475,Daenerys,Viserys,"The Usurper called him that, the Usurper and his dogs."
6476,Daenerys,Viserys,"It was a lie.Why ask for truth,if you close your ears to it?"
6477,Daenerys,Viserys,I told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that Id joined you.
6478,Daenerys,Viserys,  
6479,Daenerys,Viserys,my fathers daughter?
6480,Daenerys,Jorah,.
6481,Craster,Qhorin, he finished.
6482,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am no maester to quote history at you, Your Grace."
6483,Barristan,Jorah,"Every time a  new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how  it will land."
6484,Barristan,Jorah,"So I am a coin in  the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?No,You are the trueborn heir of Westeros."
6485,Barristan,Daenerys,"If not, I am content to serve  Strong Belwas as his squire.What if I decide youre only worthy to be my fool?"
6486,Barristan,Daenerys,"Or perhaps my cook?I would be honored, Your Grace,I  can bake apples and boil beef as well as any man, and Ive roasted many a duck over a campfire.I hope  you like them greasy, with charred skin and bloody bones."
6487,Barristan,Daenerys,"Id have to be mad to eat such fare.Ben Plumm, come give Ser Barristan your  longsword."
6488,Barristan,Daenerys,I flung my sword at Joffreys feet and have not touched one since.Only from the hand of my queen will I accept a sword again.As you wish.
6489,Barristan,Daenerys,"Now kneel,"
6490,Barristan,Jorah,"And now you, ser.Tell me true."
6491,Arstan,Xaro,"I have tried to tell you  true, half a hundred times."
6492,Arstan,Xaro,  
6493,Daenerys,Xaro,"Trust no one but Jorah Mormont, you said ... and all the time you  were the Spiders creature!I am no mans creature."
6494,Daenerys,Jorah,  You spied on me and sold me to my enemies!For a time.
6495,Daenerys,Jorah,"I stopped.When?When did you stop?I made one report from Qarth, but -  "
6496,Daenerys,Jorah,"What did you write from Qarth?That  you were my man now, that you wanted no more of their schemes?"
6497,Daenerys,Jorah,"When Khal Drogo died, you asked me to go with you to Yi Ti and the jade Sea.Was that your wish or  Roberts?That was to protect you,To keep you away from them."
6498,Barristan,Jorah,". Snakes?And what are you, ser?"
6499,Barristan,Jorah,"You told them I was  carrying Drogos child...Khaleesi...Do not think to deny it, ser,I was there when the eunuch told the council,  and Robert decreed that Her Grace and her child must die."
6500,Barristan,Jorah,"There was even  talk that you might do the deed, for a pardon.A lie."
6501,Jorah,Varys,"I would never ... Daenerys, it was me who stopped you from  drinking the wine.Yes.And how was it you knew the wine was poisoned?I ..."
6502,Jorah,Varys,"He wanted you watched, yes, but not harmed."
6503,Jorah,Varys,If I had not told them someone  else would have.You know that.I know you betrayed me.
6504,Jorah,Varys,"I know a  poisoner tried to kill my son, because of you.  no."
6505,Jorah,Varys,I never meant ... forgive me.You have to forgive me.Have to?
6506,Daenerys,Jorah,"I cant forgive you,I cant.You forgave the old man...He lied to me about his name."
6507,Daenerys,Jorah,Killed for you.
6508,Daenerys,Jorah,I went down into the sewers like a rat.For you.
6509,Daenerys,Jorah,"Daenerys,I have loved you."
6510,Daenerys,Jorah,"The gods do nothing without a purpose, they say."
6511,Belwas,Daenerys,No doubt the butcher king  needs knights.No.
6512,Belwas,Jorah,"Daenerys, please, hear me...Do not ever presume to touch me again, or to speak my name."
6513,Belwas,Jorah,Believe that.
6514,Belwas,Jorah,"Remove this liar from my sight, "
6515,Drogo,Willem,"The queen has a good heart,but that one is more  dangerous than all the Oznaks and Meros rolled up in one."
6516,Daenerys,Jorah,"You need not even say the word, my radiance.Only give  the tiniest nod, and your Daario shall fetch you back his ugly head.Leave him be."
6517,Daenerys,Jorah,Let him go home.
6518,Daenerys,Irri,"We are done for now,"
6519,Daenerys,Irri,"You are trembling, Khaleesi,Im cold,Bring me the book I was reading last night."
6520,Barristan,Viserys,Your Grace?
6521,Barristan,Viserys,"What more would you have of me, ser?I spared you, I  took you into my service, now give me some peace.Forgive me, Your Grace."
6522,Craster,Qhorin, The old man hesitated.
6523,Barristan,Viserys,I thought perhaps you might have questions for me.
6524,Daenerys,Viserys,Was my father truly mad?
6525,Daenerys,Viserys,Viserys said this talk of madness was a  ploy of the Usurpers...
6526,Craster,Qhorin,  Daenerys stopped him.
6527,Barristan,Daenerys,"Perhaps not.Not now.Not now,One day."
6528,Aegon,Barristan,"There is some    good to be said of my father, surely?There is, Your Grace."
6529,Aegon,Daenerys,Him most of all.I wish I could have known him.
6530,Aegon,Daenerys,"I wish he could have known you,When you are ready, I will tell you all."
6531,Daenerys,Missandei,Your Grace?
6532,Daenerys,Missandei,"I  woke, and saw that you were gone."
6533,Daenerys,Missandei,"What are you looking at?My city,I was looking for a house with a red door, but by night all the doors are black.A red door?"
6534,Daenerys,Missandei,What house is this?No house.It does not matter.
6535,Daenerys,Missandei,"Never lie to me, Missandei.Never betray me.I never would,Look, dawn comes."
6536,Daario,Missandei,"Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros, but afterward he gave  them peace, prosperity, and justice."
6537,Daario,Missandei,"I have been  more khal than queen, smashing and plundering, then moving on.There is nothing to stay for,Your Grace, the slavers brought their doom on themselves,You have brought freedom as well,Freedom to starve?"
6538,Daenerys,Missandei,"Freedom to die?Am I a dragon, or a harpy?"
6539,Barristan,Daenerys,"A dragon,Meereen is not Westeros, Your Grace.But how can I rule seven kingdoms if I cannot rule a single city?"
6540,Barristan,Daenerys,My children need time to heal and learn.
6541,Daenerys,Rakharo,I will not let the harpy of Yunkai chain up those Ive freed all over again.
6542,Daenerys,Rakharo,"I will not march.What will you do then, Khaleesi?"
6543,Daenerys,Rakharo,"Stay,Rule.And be a queen."
6544,Jaime,Kevan,"Only a few more, Your Grace,This is a bill of attainder against  Lord Edmure Tully, stripping him of Riverrun and all its lands and incomes, for rebelling against his lawful  king.This is a similar attainder, against his uncle Ser Brynden Tully, the Brynden."
6545,Addam,Kevan,"This grants said lands, incomes, and castle to Ser Emmon Frey and his lady wife, Lady Genna."
6546,Kevan,Tommen,This is a decree  of legitimacy for a natural son of Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort.And this names Lord Bolton your  Warden of the North.
6547,Ilyn,Tommen,This grants Ser Rolph Spicer title to the  castle Castamere and raises him to the rank of lord.
6548,Jaime,Kevan,"This is your royal pardon for Lord Gawen Westerling, his lady wife, and his daughter Jeyne, welcoming  them back into the kings peace,This is a pardon for Lord Jonos Bracken of Stone  Hedge."
6549,Jaime,Kevan,This for Lord Mooton of  Maidenpool.
6550,Jaime,Kevan,"You seem to have these matters well in hand, Uncle.I shall leave His  Grace to you.As you wish."
6551,Jaime,Kevan,"Jaime, you should go to your father.  "
6552,Jaime,Tommen,"Tell him that, if you can pry him away    from the Tyrells long enough."
6553,Jaime,Tommen,The gift was heartfelt.  
6554,Kevan,Tommen,"Sire,do I have your leave to go?As you like, Ser Uncle."
6555,Kevan,Tommen,"Can I seal them now, Great-Uncle?"
6556,Jaime,Meryn,"Remain here until His Grace is done,then escort him back to Maegors."
6557,Jaime,Walton,"As you say, my lord."
6558,Jaime,Walton,Steelshanks!
6559,Jaime,Walton,"Are you off, then?As soon as mlady is mounted,My lord of Bolton expects us.Here she is  now."
6560,Arya,Jaime,"Ser Jaime,You are kind to  see me off."
6561,Arya,Jaime,"You know me, then?"
6562,Arya,Jaime,"You may not recall, my lord, as I was littler then ... but I had the honor to meet you at  Winterfell when King Robert came to visit my father Lord Eddard.Im Arya Stark."
6563,Arya,Jaime,"I  understand youre to be married.I am to wed Lord Boltons son, Ramsay."
6564,Arya,Jaime,I am so happy.
6565,Arya,Jaime,"I wish you joy, my lady."
6566,Arya,Jaime,"You have the coin you were promised?Aye, and weve shared it out.You have my thanks."
6567,Arya,Jaime,"A Lannister always pays  his debts.Always,"
6568,Arya,Jaime,"Good speed,"
6569,Gregor,Pycelle,"The flesh mortifies and the wounds ooze pus,Even maggots will not  touch such foulness."
6570,Oberyn,Tywin,Let us detain these other  Domishmen until they are more forthcoming.
6571,Oberyn,Tywin,There will be trouble enough with Sunspear over Prince Oberyns death.I  do not mean to make matters worse by holding his companions captive.Then I fear Ser Gregor may die.Undoubtedly.
6572,Pycelle,Tywin,Heal him.
6573,Pycelle,Tywin,"MY lord -   Lord Tywin said again, vexed."
6574,Pycelle,Stannis,"The Lyseni  are gone from the bay, and the great part of Lord Stanniss strength with them.Well and good,Let Stannis rot in Lys, I say.We are well rid of the man and his  ambitions.Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard?"
6575,Jaime,Tywin,"The Domishmen are free to go, and you  will heal Ser Gregor."
6576,Jaime,Tommen,Cersei.
6577,Jaime,Tommen,Why are you here?Where else could I go?
6578,Jaime,Tommen,"Fathers made it clear  that I am no longer wanted on the council.Jaime, wont you talk to him?"
6579,Jaime,Tommen,I talk to Lord Tywin every day.Must you be so stubborn?  
6580,Jaime,Tommen,is to force me from the Kingsguard and send me back to Casterly Rock.That need not be so terrible.
6581,Jaime,Tommen,"Tornmen is my son, not his!Tommen is the king.He is a boy!"
6582,Myrcella,Tommen,The girl is twice his age and twice a widow!
6583,Myrcella,Tommen,The Tyrells are insisting.
6584,Joffrey,Margaery,  
6585,Joffrey,Margaery,. He is my seed.
6586,Joffrey,Robert,You warned me a  thousand times never to show any undue interest in them.To keep them safe!
6587,Jaime,Robert,"Even Robert might have grown suspicious.Well, hes beyond suspicion now."
6588,Cersei,Jaime,I only wished hed died at my  hands.
6589,Cersei,Jaime,"If Id let kingslaying become a habit, as he liked to say, I could  have taken you as my wife for all the world to see."
6590,Cersei,Jaime,. Did I tell you to throw him out the window?
6591,Catelyn,Jaime,"But no, you had to have me, you could not wait until we returned to the city.Id waited long enough.I hated watching Robert stumble to your bed every night, always wondering if  maybe this night hed decide to claim his rights as husband."
6592,Catelyn,Jaime,"At Riverrun, Catelyn Stark seemed convinced Id sent some footpad  to slit her sons throat.That Id given him a dagger.That,Tyrion asked me about that.There was a dagger."
6593,Catelyn,Cersei,"?Oh, dont be absurd."
6594,Cersei,Robert,"Yes, I hoped the boy would die."
6595,Jaime,Robert,"He was blind himself at the time, from drink."
6596,Cersei,Robert,"Were you alone when Robert said this?You dont think he said it to Eddard Stark, I hope?"
6597,Cersei,Robert,Us and the children.
6598,Cersei,Jaime,"Perhaps Myrcella  sent this man with the dagger, do you think so?"
6599,Cersei,Jaime,Not Myrcella.Joffrey.
6600,Cersei,Jaime,"Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark, but the younger boy was nothing to him.He was  only a child himself . A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was his father."
6601,Cersei,Joffrey,Tyrion almost died because of this bloody dagger.   Cersei said.
6602,Cersei,Jaime,"Tyrion murdered him in front of me, and there was nothing I could  do."
6603,Jaime,Tommen,Joffrey is  dead and Myrcellas in Dome.
6604,Jaime,Tommen,"Jaime,  please.Lord Tywin has not asked for my approval.  Im not leaving the Kingsguard."
6605,Jaime,Tommen,"Jaime, youre my shining knight."
6606,Addam,Jaime,"He is stealing my son, sending me away ... and unless you stop him, Father is going to force me to  wed again!"
6607,Addam,Jaime,Who? Does it matter?
6608,Addam,Tommen,"You are the only man I want in my bed, ever again.Then tell him that!"
6609,Myrcella,Tommen,You are talking madness again.
6610,Jaime,Myrcella,We are brother and sister.The Targaryens .
6611,Jaime,Myrcella,"We are not Targaryens!Quiet,So loud, youll wake my Sworn Brothers."
6612,Jaime,Myrcella,"People might learn that you had come to see me. she sobbed, "
6613,Jaime,Myrcella,Let me prove it to you.
6614,Cersei,Jaime,"No,not here."
6615,Cersei,Jaime,"Cersei, this is not the place.You took me in the sept.This is no different."
6616,Cersei,Jaime,"No.Not here, I said."
6617,Cersei,Joffrey,"Was it your hand they hacked off in Harrenhal, or your manhood?"
6618,Joffrey,Tommen,I was a fool to come.
6619,Joffrey,Tommen,"Tell me, if the imp had killed all three of your  children, would that have made you wroth?Tyrion is not going to harm Tornmen or Myrcella.I am still not certain he killed Joffrey."
6620,Joffrey,Tommen,"How can you say that?  He swears he did not do it.Oh, he swears, is that it?And dwarfs dont lie, is that what you think?Not to me.No more than you would.You great golden fool. She bound up her hair again,  and scooped up the hairnet from the bedpost where shed hung it."
6621,Ilyn,Jaime,Perhaps youd like it for a keepsake.
6622,Ilyn,Jaime,"He can watch over you as you sleep alone in that cold white bed.Until his eyes rot  out, that is.You had best go, Cersei.Youre making me angry.Oh, an angry cripple.How terrifying."
6623,Ilyn,Jaime,A pity Lord Tywin Lannister never had a son.
6624,Ilyn,Jaime,"it looks rather sad and small, hanging from your breeches like that."
6625,Boros,Jaime,"When youre done with your drink, tell Ser Loras Im ready to see her."
6626,Boros,Jaime,You are ready to see who?Just tell Loras.Aye.
6627,Boros,Jaime,"Aye, Lord Commander."
6628,Jaime,Stannis,"Lord  Commander,you wished to see the Maid of Tarth?I did."
6629,Jaime,Stannis,"You have talked with her, I take it?As you commanded, my lord.And?"
6630,Jaime,Stannis,"I ... it may be it happened as she says, ser."
6631,Jaime,Stannis,"I cannot be certain.Varys tells me that the castellan of Storms End perished strangely as well,Ser Cortnay Penrose,A good man.A stubborn man."
6632,Brienne,Jaime,The next he leapt  from a tower.
6633,Brienne,Jaime,"Ser Loras, we will talk more of this later.You may leave Brienne with me."
6634,Brienne,Jaime,"Blue is a good color on you, my lady,It goes well with your  eyes."
6635,Brienne,Jaime,"Septa Donyse padded out the bodice, to give it that shape.She said you sent her to me."
6636,Brienne,Jaime,You look .
6637,Brienne,Jaime,. Different?
6638,Brienne,Jaime,"More meat on the ribs and fewer lice in my hair, thats all."
6639,Brienne,Jaime,Close the door and come here.
6640,Catelyn,Jaime,The white cloak.
6641,Catelyn,Jaime,.
6642,Catelyn,Jaime,"is new, but Im sure Ill soil it soon enough.That wasnt ...I was about to say that it becomes you."
6643,Catelyn,Jaime,"Jaime, did you mean what you told Ser Loras?About ... about King Renly,  and the shadow?"
6644,Catelyn,Jaime,"I would have killed Renly myself if wed met in battle, what do I care who cut his  throat?You said I had honor."
6645,Catelyn,Jaime,". Im the bloody Kingslayer, remember?When I say you have honor, thats like a whore vouchsafing  your maidenhood."
6646,Catelyn,Jaime,"Steelshanks is on his way back north, to  deliver Arya Stark to Roose Bolton.You gave her to him?"
6647,Catelyn,Jaime,You swore an oath to Lady Catelyn .
6648,Catelyn,Jaime,". With a sword at my throat, but never mind."
6649,Brienne,Catelyn,And the girl my father sent with Steelshanks was not Arya Stark.Not Arya Stark?You heard me.
6650,Brienne,Catelyn,"He dressed her up in white and grey, gave her  a silver wolf to pin her cloak, and sent her off to wed Boltons bastard."
6651,Arya,Brienne,"I wanted to tell you that before you went galloping off to rescue her and got yourself killed for no  good purpose.Youre not half bad with a sword, but youre not good enough to take on two hundred  men by yourself."
6652,Arya,Brienne,When Lord Bolton learns that your father paid him with false coin...
6653,Arya,Brienne,"Everyone the girl was close to is dead except for her  sister, who has disappeared.Why would you tell me all this, if its true?You are betraying your fathers secrets."
6654,Arya,Catelyn,l pay my debts like every good little lion.
6655,Arya,Catelyn,Cersei is convinced that Sansa helped him murder Joffrey.
6656,Brienne,Catelyn,I will not believe that gentle girl a poisoner.
6657,Brienne,Catelyn,"There was a trial, Ser Loras said.Two trials, actually."
6658,Brienne,Jaime,"Did you watch from your  window?My cell faces the sea.I heard the shouting, though.Prince Oberyn of Dome is dead, Ser Gregor Clegane lies dying, and Tyrion stands condemned before  the eyes of gods and men."
6659,Brienne,Jaime,You do not believe he did it.
6660,Jaime,Tyrion,"See, wench?"
6661,Brienne,Jaime,"This time it will mean his head.No,It was not my ladys daughter.It could not have been her.Theres the stubborn stupid wench that I remember."
6662,Brienne,Jaime,My name is .
6663,Brienne,Jaime,. Brienne of Tarth.
6664,Brienne,Jaime,I have a gift for you.
6665,Brienne,Sansa,Is this Valyrian steel?I have never seen such colors.Nor I.
6666,Brienne,Sansa,Take it.
6667,Brienne,Sansa,A  sword so fine must bear a name.
6668,Brienne,Sansa,The blade comes with a price.
6669,Brienne,Sansa,"I told you, I will never serve."
6670,Brienne,Sansa,. ... such foul creatures as us.
6671,Brienne,Cersei,. 
6672,Brienne,Cersei,"If you believe that I would harm my ladys daughter for a sword,  you - fust listen,I want you to find Sansa first, and get her  somewhere safe."
6673,Catelyn,Jaime,I ... 
6674,Ilyn,Jaime,"When Eddard Stark died, his greatsword was given to the Kings  justice,But my father felt that such a fine blade was wasted on a mere headsman."
6675,Ilyn,Sansa,"So youll be defending Eddard Starks daughter with Eddard Starks own steel, if  that makes any difference to you.Ser, I ..."
6676,Ilyn,Sansa,"Take the bloody sword and go, before I change my mind."
6677,Joffrey,Sansa,I dont want to look at you anymore.Jaime ...   he reminded her.
6678,Cersei,Joffrey,Joffrey was your.
6679,Cersei,Joffrey,My king.Leave it at that.You say Sansa killed him.Why protect her?
6680,Cersei,Jaime,I have made kings and unmade them.Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor.
6681,Cersei,Jaime,"Besides, kingslayers should band together.Are you ever going to go?"
6682,Cersei,Jaime,I will.
6683,Cersei,Jaime,And for yours.
6684,Alliser,Jon,"You will die in here, Lord Snow,That old maester says I cannot hang you,He has written Cotter Pyke, and even had  the bloody gall to show me the letter.He says you are no tumcloak.Aemons lived too long, my lord,His wits have gone dark as his eyes.Aye,A blind man with a chain about his neck, who does he think he is?"
6685,Janos,Jon,"Still,"
6686,Janos,Jon,"One last chance to do  your duty, yes!"
6687,Janos,Jon,Mance Rayder wants to parley with us.
6688,Alliser,Jon,"He asks that we send an envoy to him.Were sending you, Lord Snow."
6689,Alliser,Jon,Me.
6690,Alliser,Jon,"Why me?You rode with these wildlings,Mance Rayder knows you.He will be more inclined to  trust you."
6691,Jon,Mance,Youve got it backward.
6692,Jon,Mance,"If I show up in his camp wearing a black cloak again and speaking for the Nights Watch, hell know  that I betrayed him.He asked for an envoy, we are sending one,If you are too craven to face this tumcloak  king, we can return you to your ice cell."
6693,Alliser,Mance,"Yes.No need for that, my lord,Lord Snow will do as we ask."
6694,Alliser,Jon,He wants to prove himself a loyal man of the Nights Watch.
6695,Janos,Jon,"Ill go,Mlord, Youll address me - "
6696,Alliser,Mance,Terms?
6697,Alliser,Jon,"Janos Slynt does not make terms with lawless savages, Lord Snow.No, he does not.Were not sending you to talk with Mance Rayder,Were sending you to kill him."
6698,Janos,Qhorin,"Our honor means  no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe,"
6699,Jon,Mance,"Snow,Snow, snow"
6700,Mance,Tormund,Har!
6701,Mance,Tormund,"Jon Snow the crow.I feared wed seen the last o  you.I never knew you feared anything, Tormund."
6702,Mance,Tormund,"Well said, lad."
6703,Mance,Tormund,"If youve  come to change sides again, best climb back on that Wall o yours.Theyve sent me to treat with the King-beyond-the-Wall.Treat?"
6704,Mance,Tormund,Now theres a word.
6705,Mance,Tormund,"Cant  say hed want to talk with you, though.Im the one theyve sent.I see that."
6706,Mance,Tormund,"You want to ride?I can walk.,,  "
6707,Donal,Tormund,You and your  brothers.
6708,Donal,Tormund,Mag himself went in that gate o yours  and never did come out.He died on the sword of a brave man named Donal Noye.Aye?
6709,Donal,Tormund,One of your shiny knights in their steel smallclothes?A blacksmith.He only had one arm.A one-armed smith slew Mag the Mighty?
6710,Donal,Tormund,"Mance will make a  song of it, see if he dont."
6711,Jon,Tormund,"This will warm  us some.To Donal Noye, and Mag the Mighty."
6712,Jon,Tormund,"To Donal Noye, and Mag the Mighty."
6713,Jon,Tormund,"The Magnar of Therm  swore tus that hed have the gate wide open, so all wed need to do was stroll through singing.He was  going to bring the whole Wall down.He brought down part,On his head.Har!"
6714,Jon,Tormund,"Well, I never had much use for Styr.When a mans got no beard nor hair nor  ears, you cant get a good grip on him when you fight."
6715,Jon,Tormund,"What happened to that leg?An arrow.One of Ygrittes, I think.Thats a woman for you.One day shes kissing you, the next shes filling you with arrows.Shes dead.Aye?"
6716,Jon,Tormund,A waste.
6717,Craster,Qhorin, He lifted the skin of mead.
6718,Jon,Tormund,"To Ygritte, kissed by fire,"
6719,Jon,Tormund,Was it you killed her?My brother.
6720,Jon,Tormund,You bloody crows.
6721,Toregg,Tormund,That Longspear stole me daughter.
6722,Jon,Tormund,"The young ones gave the lad a fight, though.And Munda?"
6723,Jon,Tormund,"Shes my own blood,She broke his lip for him and bit one ear half off, and I  hear hes got so many scratches on his back he cant wear a cloak."
6724,Jon,Ygritte,Har!
6725,Tormund,Ygritte,"You know nothing, Jon Snow,"
6726,Tormund,Ygritte,"All men die,and women too, and every beast  that flies or swims or runs."
6727,Harma,Varamyr,"You must be very brave or very stupid, Jon Snow,to come back to us wearing a black cloak.What else would a man of the Nights Watch wear?Kill him,Send his body back up in that cage o theirs and tell them to send us someone  else."
6728,Harma,Varamyr,A turncloaks worse than a dog.I warned you he was false.
6729,Jon,Tormund,"I never did like the smell o him.Pull in your claws, beastling."
6730,Harma,Tormund,"The lads here to hear.You lay a paw on him, might be Ill take me that shadowskin cloak I been wanting.Tormund Crowlover,You are a great sack owind, old man."
6731,Harma,Tormund,"Once a horse is broken to the saddle, any man can mount him,Once a beasts  been joined to a man, any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him."
6732,Mance,Tormund,"And I can soar above the Wall, and see with eagle eyes.So we know,We know how few you were, when you stopped the turtle."
6733,Mance,Tormund,And now you know we know.
6734,Dalla,Tormund,"Come inside.The rest of you, wait here.What, even me?"
6735,Dalla,Tormund,Particularly you.Always.
6736,Dalla,Jon,"I was  sorry when Jarl fell,"
6737,Dalla,Jon,He always climbed too fast.
6738,Jon,Mance,"Dallas time is near,She and Val will stay.They know what I mean to say."
6739,Jon,Mance,"Yes,The Horn of Winter, that Joramun once blew to wake giants from the earth."
6740,Dalla,Jon,Ygritte said you never found the hom.Did you think only crows could lie?
6741,Dalla,Jon,A  man needs to earn my trust.
6742,Dalla,Jon,"If youve had the Hom of Joramun all along, why havent you used it?"
6743,Dalla,Jon,"If this hom is all the songs say, why not just  sound it and be done?"
6744,Dalla,Jon,We  free folk know things you kneelers have forgotten.
6745,Jon,Mance,There is no safe way to grasp it.
6746,Bowen,Mance,"No man goes hunting with only one arrow in his  quiver,I had hoped that Styr and Jarl would take your brothers unawares, and open the gate  for us."
6747,Jon,Mance,"I could send men and mammoths to dig out the gates at the castles youve abandoned, all of  them at once.Why dont you, then?"
6748,Jon,Mance,"Blood,Id win in the end, yes, but youd bleed me, and my people have bled  enough.Your losses havent been that heavy.Not at your hands."
6749,Jon,Mance,You saw the Fist of  the First Men.
6750,Jon,Mance,You know what we are facing.The Others .
6751,Jon,Mance,They grow stronger as the days grow shorter and the nights colder.
6752,Jon,Mance,"The giants have not been able to stand against them, nor the Thenns, the ice river  clans, the Homfoots.Nor you?Nor me."
6753,Jon,Mance,"Raymun Redbeard,  Bael the Bard, Gendel and Gorne, the Homed Lord, they all came south to conquer, but Ive come with  my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall."
6754,Jon,Mance,"If I sound the Hom of  Winter, the Wall will fall."
6755,Jon,Mance,"   Dalla said, "
6756,Jon,Mance,Its a wise woman Ive found.A true queen.
6757,Jon,Mance,"Go  back and tell them to open their gate and let us pass.If they do, I will give them the hom, and the Wall  will stand until the end of days."
6758,Jon,Mance,Are  you a true king?
6759,Jon,Mance,"Ive never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne, if thats what youre asking,My birth is as low as a mans can get, no septons ever smeared my head with oils, I  dont own any castles, and my queen wears furs and amber, not silk and sapphires."
6760,Mag,Tormund,"The other three I slew, when they made it  plain theyd sooner fight than follow.You can kill your enemies,but can you rule your friends?"
6761,Mag,Mance,When we want laws well  make our own.
6762,Jon,Mance,We will not kneel to you.What if we refuse the offer?
6763,Alliser,Janos,"If you refuse,Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Winter three days  hence, at dawn."
6764,Mance,Tormund,"Outriders horn,Somethings coming."
6765,Harma,Jon,"Coming,  from the east."
6766,Harma,Jon,"East?The wights should be behind us.East,Somethings coming.The Others?"
6767,Jon,Mance,The Others never come when the sun is up.
6768,Jon,Mance,Where the  bloody hell do they think theyre going?
6769,Mance,Tormund,Ill want my armor too.
6770,Mance,Tormund,"Harma, mount up your raiders.Tormund, find your sons and give me a triple line of spears.Aye,I see them.Theyre coming along the streams and  game trails...Who?Men."
6771,Jon,Mance,Men in steel and men in black.Crows.
6772,Janos,Jon,Did my old brothers think theyd catch me  with my breeches down if they attacked while we were talking?If they planned an attack they never told me about it.
6773,Jon,Mance,"If youre lying to me again, you wont be leaving here alive,"
6774,Jon,Mance,"You knew nothing of this, did you?"
6775,Harma,Mance,"Believe what you will,but I knew nothing of any attack."
6776,Cotter,Mance,"Might be youre telling it true,Those look like Eastwatch men."
6777,Cotter,Mance,  
6778,Jon,Mance,"Mance, theres  more, theyre all around us, iron men, iron, a host of iron men."
6779,Jon,Mance,"Varamyr, stay and see that no harm comes to Dalla."
6780,Jon,Mance,"And keep a few extra eyes on this crow.If he runs, rip  out his throat. Aye, Ill do that."
6781,Mance,Varamyr,"Theyre coming from the north too,You  best go."
6782,Mance,Varamyr,"Arrowhead,to me, form wedge."
6783,Jon,Varamyr,"Banners,"
6784,Jon,Varamyr,. 
6785,Jon,Varamyr,The king ... no...
6786,Jon,Varamyr,"What is it, whats happened?"
6787,Jon,Varamyr,Whats wrong with him?
6788,Jon,Varamyr,Wheres Mance?There.
6789,Harma,Jon,Gone to fight.
6790,Harma,Jon,Gone?
6791,Harma,Jon,Its started.The battle?
6792,Harma,Jon,The birth!
6793,Harma,Robb,"You best get back inside the tent,"
6794,Chett,Mance,"Gods,gods, why are they doing this?Go inside the tent and stay with Dalla.Its not safe out here."
6795,Chett,Mance,"I need to find the midwife,Youre the midwife.Ill stay here until Mance comes back."
6796,Craster,Qhorin,
6797,Jon,Stannis,STANNIS!
6798,Mordane,Sandor,"We dont want to go in,there might be ghosts.You know how long its been since I had a cup of wine?"
6799,Mordane,Sandor,"Besides, we need to learn who holds the ruby ford.Stay with the horses if you want, its no hair off my  arse.What if they know you?"
6800,Arya,Sandor,They might want to take you captive.Let them try.
6801,Arya,Polliver,"Looking for your brother, Sandor?"
6802,Arya,Polliver,"Looking for a cup of wine.Innkeep, a flagon of red."
6803,Arya,Polliver,"I dont want no trouble, ser,Then dont call me ser."
6804,Arya,Polliver,"Are you deaf, fool?I ordered wine.Two cups!"
6805,Arya,Tickler,is this the lost puppy Ser Gregor spoke of?
6806,Arya,Tickler,The one who piddled in the rushes and ran off?
6807,Arya,Polliver,Ser said his puppy brother tucked his tail between his legs  when the battle got too warm at Kings Landing.He said he ran off whimpering.
6808,Arya,Polliver,"The lads drunk,"
6809,Sandor,Tickler,"He cant hold his wine, is all.Then he shouldnt drink.The puppy doesnt scare ."
6810,Sandor,Tickler,. 
6811,Arya,Polliver,"Now you can pour.Best pick up those coppers too,  its the only coin youre like to see today.Well pay when were done drinking,When youre done drinking youll tickle the innkeep to see where he keeps his gold.The way you  always do."
6812,Arya,Polliver,"If youre looking for Ser, you come too late,He was at Harrenhal, but now hes not.The  queen sent for him."
6813,Arya,Joffrey,"King Joffreys dead,  you know,Poisoned at his own wedding feast."
6814,Robb,Sandor,So much for my brave brothers of the Kingsguard.
6815,Robb,Sandor,"Who killed  him?The Imp, its thought.Him and his little wife.What wife?I forgot, youve been hiding under a rock."
6816,Arya,Sansa,But she left the dwarf behind and Cersei means to have his head.
6817,Arya,Sandor,She ought  to dip him in wildfire and cook him.or tickle him till the moon turns black.
6818,Polliver,Sandor,So Gregor took Harrenhal?
6819,Polliver,Sandor,"Didnt require much taking,The sellswords fled as soon as they knew we were coming,  all but a few.One of the cooks opened a postern gate for us, to get back at Hoat for cutting off his foot."
6820,Arya,Polliver,"We kept him to cook for us, a couple wenches to warm our beds, and put all the rest to  the sword.All the rest?"
6821,Arya,Sandor,"Well, Ser kept Hoat to pass the time.The Brynden is still in Riverrun?Not for long,Hes under siege."
6822,Arya,Sandor,The Brackens are ours  now.
6823,Arya,Polliver,"The little bird flew away, did she?"
6824,Polliver,Tickler,"She shit on the Imps head  and flew off.Theyll find her,If it takes half the gold in Casterly Rock.A pretty girl, I hear,Honey sweet."
6825,Polliver,Tickler,"And courteous,A proper little lady.Not like her bloody sister.They found her too,The sister.Shes for Boltons bastard, I hear."
6826,Polliver,Sandor,Whats so bloody funny?
6827,Arya,Sandor,"If Id wanted you to know, Id have told you.Are there ships  at Saltpans?Saltpans?"
6828,Arya,Tickler,I havent heard shit about Saltpans.
6829,Arya,Tickler,Would you put to sea without bidding farewell to your brother?
6830,Arya,Tickler,"Ser would sooner you returned to Harrenhal with us, Sandor."
6831,Arya,Tickler,. Bugger that.
6832,Arya,Tickler,Bugger you.
6833,Arya,Polliver,I was hoping youd do something stupid.
6834,Arya,Tickler,Are you the puppys puppy?
6835,Polliver,Tickler,"Throw down  the sword, and well take you back to Harrenhal,So Gregor can finish me himself?Maybe hell give you to me.If you want me, come get me."
6836,Polliver,Sandor,You think we wont?
6837,Polliver,Sandor,"Youre drunk.Might be,but youre dead."
6838,Arya,Sandor,Is there gold hidden in the village?
6839,Arya,Sandor,Is there  silver?Gems?
6840,Arya,Sandor,Is there food?Where is Lord Beric?
6841,Arya,Sandor,Where did he go?
6842,Arya,Sandor,is there gold in  the village?
6843,Arya,Sandor,"Enough,"
6844,Arya,Sandor,"Theres one more,"
6845,Arya,Sandor,"Mercy,"
6846,Arya,Sandor,Mother have mercy.Do I look like your bloody mother?
6847,Arya,Sandor,"You killed this one too,Pricked him in his bowels, thats the end of him.Hell be a long time dying, though."
6848,Arya,Sandor,"I came for the girls,."
6849,Arya,Sandor,"a maester, take me to a maester, my fathers got gold ...  it was only for the girls ... mercy, ser."
6850,Arya,Sandor,Dont call me ser.
6851,Arya,Polliver,"This one is yours, she-wolf.You do it."
6852,Polliver,Sandor,You remember where the heart is?
6853,Polliver,Sandor,Mercy.
6854,Polliver,Sandor,Good.
6855,Arya,Sandor,"If these three were whoring here, Gregor must hold the  ford as well as Harrenhal.More of his pets could ride up any moment, and weve killed enough of the  bloody buggers for one day.Where will we go?"
6856,Arya,Sandor,Saltpans.
6857,Arya,Sandor,"Get some wine, she-wolf."
6858,Arya,Sandor,"If theres ships at Saltpans, we can reach the Vale by sea."
6859,Arya,Sandor,Maybe Lady Lysa  will marry you to her little Robert.Theres a match Id like to see.
6860,Arya,Sandor,"Here  will do,Water the horses and gather some deadwood for a fire."
6861,Arya,Sandor,"Wont the smoke be seen?Anyone wants to find us, all they need to do is follow my blood."
6862,Arya,Sandor,But bring me that  wineskin first.
6863,Arya,Sandor,"If I had more wine, Id  drink till I was dead to the world.Maybe I ought to send you back to that bloody inn for another skin or  three. No,"
6864,Arya,Sandor,"A jest, wolf girl."
6865,Arya,Sandor,I hate the taste of mud.
6866,Arya,Sandor,"Get the  cup from my bedroll and dip it half full,Be careful."
6867,Arya,Sandor,Think you can do that?
6868,Arya,Sandor,Then what are you waiting for?
6869,Arya,Sandor,Turn your head.
6870,Arya,Polliver,"Ser Gregor the Mountain,Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen  Cersei."
6871,Mycah,Sandor,"Sandor,Valar morghulis."
6872,Arya,Sandor,"I need to rest,"
6873,Arya,Sandor,"Bloody hell,Bloody hell.Id skin you alive for a cup of wine, girl."
6874,Arya,Polliver,You remember where the heart is?
6875,Arya,Polliver,I ...   he growled.
6876,Arya,Polliver,"Go on, do it.I killed your butchers boy."
6877,Arya,Sandor,"And the little bird, your pretty sister, I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her."
6878,Arya,Sandor,I should have fucked her bloody  and ripped her heart out before leaving her for that dwarf.
6879,Arya,Sandor,"Do you  mean to make me beg, bitch?"
6880,Arya,Sandor,  
6881,Arya,Sandor,You dont deserve the gift of mercy.
6882,Arya,Sandor,A real wolf would finish a wounded animal.
6883,Arya,Sandor,"You shouldnt have hit me with an axe,You  should have saved my mother."
6884,Arya,Chett,"Shes a  well-bred horse, thats plain enough, and I dont doubt she belonged to a knight, sweetling,But the knight wasnt no dead brother o yours."
6885,Arya,Chett,"This mare is well-bred, but youre not."
6886,Arya,Chett,"Found her or stole her, never mind which, thats how it was.Only way a scruffy little thing like you  comes to ride a palfrey."
6887,Arya,Chett,Does that mean you wont buy her?
6888,Arya,Chett,"It means youll take what I give you, sweetling."
6889,Arya,Chett,"Or even hanged, for stealing some good knights horse."
6890,Arya,Chett,"I want to see the  captain,"
6891,Arya,Chett,"I am captain here,What is your wish?Be quick, child, we have a tide to catch.I want to go north, to the Wall.Here, I can pay."
6892,Arya,Chett,The Nights Watch has a    castle on the sea.Eastwatch.
6893,Arya,Chett,Is this all you have?
6894,Arya,Chett,"I wouldnt need a cabin or  anything,I could sleep down in the hold, or...Take her on as cabin girl,She can sleep  with me.Mind your tongue,I could work,I could scrub the decks."
6895,Arya,Chett,". No,you couldnt."
6896,Arya,Chett,"It would make no difference if you could,  child."
6897,Arya,Chett,"From here we bend our oars  for home, and I suggest you do the same."
6898,Arya,Chett,"What ship is this, my lord? "
6899,Arya,Chett,"This is the galleas Titans Daughter, of the Free City  of Braavos.Wait,I have something else."
6900,Arya,Chett,"One more silver will make no difference, child,Its not silver."
6901,Arya,Chett,Its iron.Here.
6902,Arya,Gilly,This ... how ...?
6903,Arya,Gilly,"Valar morghulis,Valar dohaeris,Of course you shall have a cabin."
6904,Gilly,Mance,He sucks harder than mine.
6905,Gilly,Mance,"Hes hungry,Hes  lived on goats milk up to now, and potions from that blind maester."
6906,Gilly,Samwell,the little princebom-in-battle.
6907,Denys,Samwell,"My brothers,No one uses this road but the  Nights Watch."
6908,Harma,Mance,"Stannis landed his knights at  Eastwatch, and Cotter Pyke led him along  the rangers roads, to take the wildlings unawares,He smashed them."
6909,Harma,Samwell,"The rest scattered like leaves  before a storm, we heard."
6910,Gilly,Stannis,"The big one, the gold with the black stag,  thats the royal standard of House Baratheon,The  fox-and-flowers is House Florent.The turtle is Estermont, the swordfish is Bar Emmon, and the crossed  trumpets are for Wensington.Theyre all bright as flowers."
6911,Gilly,Stannis,"I like those yellow ones, with the fire.Look, and some of  the fighters have the same thing on their blouses.A fiery heart.I dont know whose sigil that is."
6912,Gilly,Stannis,"Queens men,Run  and bar the doors, lads, its Samwellthe Slayer come back from the grave,"
6913,Grenn,Samwell,He brought no woman but the red one.The red one?
6914,Grenn,Samwell,"Melisandre of Asshai,The kings sorceress."
6915,Jon,Samwell,It glows like it had  a piece of sun inside it.
6916,Jon,Samwell,I still cant  believe youre here.
6917,Jon,Samwell,"You made it  back after all,And brought Gilly out as well."
6918,Gilly,Jon,"Its strange,Craster had no love for Mance, nor Mance for Craster, but now  Crasters daughter is feeding Mances son.I have the milk,Mine takes only a little.Hes not so greedy as this  one."
6919,Gilly,Jon,"Ive heard the queens men saying that the red woman  means to give Mance to the fire, as soon as he is strong enough."
6920,Jon,Samwell,Mance is a  deserter from the Nights Watch.
6921,Jon,Samwell,"if the Watch had taken him, he would  have been hanged by now, but hes the kings captive, and no one knows the kings mind but the red  woman.I want to see him,I want to show him his son.He deserves that much, before you kill him."
6922,Jon,Samwell,"No one is permitted to see him but Maester Aemon, my lady.If it were in my power, Mance could hold his son."
6923,Jon,Samwell,"Im sorry, Val."
6924,Jon,Samwell,Samwelland I have duties to return to.
6925,Mance,Samwell,Thats all I can promise.
6926,Jon,Samwell,"Youre more than fond of Gilly, arent  you?"
6927,Jon,Samwell,Gillys good.Shes good and kind.
6928,Gilly,Ygritte,"She ... she made me  braver, Jon."
6929,Samwell,Ygritte,"braver.You know you cannot keep her,"
6930,Gilly,Samwell,The same as all of us.I know.
6931,Jon,Samwell,"I dont    know if that made her sad or glad, but I told her.Jon, could there be  honor in a lie, if it were told for a ... a good purpose?It would depend on the lie and the purpose, I suppose.I wouldnt advise it. said Samwell "
6932,Craster,Qhorin, He  was blushing again.
6933,Craster,Jon,. Growing up a bastard in his grandfathers castle?
6934,Craster,Jon,"That depends in great part on your  father, and what sort of boy this is."
6935,Craster,Jon,. He wont.
6936,Craster,Jon,"You saw him, he was hard as an old tree stump, and Gilly is stronger  than she looks.If the boy shows any skill with sword or lance, he should have a place with your fathers household  guard at the least,Its not unknown for bastards to be trained as squires and raised to  knighthood."
6937,Gilly,Jon,"From what youve told me of  Lord Randyll, I doubt he would take kindly to being deceived."
6938,Melisandre,Samwell,Are you going  to the practice yard again?
6939,Jon,Samwell,Is it wise to train so hard before your  legs done healing?
6940,Jon,Samwell,"What else is there for me to do?Marsh has removed me from duty, for fear that Im still  a turncloak.Its only a few who believe that,Ser Alliser and his friends."
6941,Samwell,Stannis,"You brought him the Horn of Winter and captured  Mance Rayders son.All I did was protect Val and the babe against looters when the wildlings fled, and keep them there until  the rangers found us."
6942,Alliser,Stannis,"I failed to kill Mance Rayder  because I was in league with him, he says.Thats only Ser Alliser,Everyone knows the sort of man he is."
6943,Janos,Robb,"What everyone knows is that Ser Alliser is a knight from a noble line, and trueborn, while Im the  bastard who killed Qhorin Halfhand and bedded with a spearwife."
6944,Janos,Robb,"How can I be a warg without a wolf, I ask you?"
6945,Janos,Robb,I dont even dream of Ghost  anymore.
6946,Robb,Samwell,"But theres a wall between us, and I know that no place  has been set for me."
6947,Coldhands,Jojen,"The world believes the boy is dead,Let his bones lie undisturbed."
6948,Jon,Samwell,Swear it for the life you owe me.Lord Janos will never be chosen Lord Commander.
6949,Jon,Samwell,That wont happen.Samwell youre a sweet fool.
6950,Jon,Samwell,"Its been happening for days.I may know nothing, but I know that."
6951,Aemon,Stannis,"Snow,Snow,  snow, snow"
6952,Grenn,Hobb,"You were leading most of the way, but Watt of Long Lake got  three in the last day and passed you.I never win anything,The gods always smiled on Watt, though."
6953,Grenn,Hobb,"How  lucky was that, missing all those rocks?Was it a long fall?"
6954,Grenn,Hobb,"Did landing in the pool of water save his life?No,He was dead already, from that axe in his head.Still, it was pretty lucky,  missing the rocks."
6955,Bowen,Janos,"And look down there, thats Ser Alliser whispering with Othell Yarwyck."
6956,Bowen,Janos,I just want to say to whoever is voting for  me that I would certainly make an awful Lord Commander.But so would all these others.
6957,Bowen,Janos,"Brothers and friends, I  am asking that my name be withdrawn from this choosing."
6958,Cotter,Samwell,Let us all give him our support.
6959,Aemon,Clydas,"Two hundred and three for Ser Denys Mallister,One hundred and sixty-nine for Cotter Pyke.One hundred and thirty-seven for Lord Janos Slynt,  seventy-two for Othell Yarwyck, five for Three-Finger Hobb, and two for Dolorous Edd.I had one hundred and sixty-eight for Pyke,We are two votes short by my count, and  one by Sams.Sams count is correct,Jon Snow did not cast a token."
6960,Aemon,Samwell,No  one is close.
6961,Clydas,Janos,Who are these five who keep voting for Three-Finger Hobb?
6962,Clydas,Samwell,Brothers who want him out of the kitchens?
6963,Clydas,Samwell,"Ser Denys is down ten votes since yesterday,And Cotter Pyke is down almost  twenty.Thats not good.Not good for their hopes of becoming Lord Commander, certainly,Yet it may  be good for the Nights Watch, in the end."
6964,Aemon,Samwell,The brothers will come to a  decision in their own time.
6965,Grenn,Samwell,"Cotter Pyke and  Ser Denys Mallister have been losing ground, but between them they still have almost two-thirds,Either one would be fine as Lord Commander.Someone needs to convince one of  them to withdraw and support the other.Someone?"
6966,Grenn,Samwell,"What someone?Grenn is so dumb he thinks someone might be him,Maybe when someone is done with  Pyke and Mallister, he should convince King Stannis to marry Queen Cersei too.King Stannis is married,What am I going to do with him, SamwellCotter Pyke and Ser Denys dont like each other much,They fight about  everything.Yes, but only because they have different ideas about whats best for the Watch,If we  explained -We?"
6967,Grenn,Samwell,How did someone change to we?
6968,Grenn,Samwell,"And Grenn  is, well, Grenn. "
6969,Grenn,Samwell,"You, now ... youre a lords son, and the  maesters steward.   said Grenn. Samwelltold him for the hundredth time. Pyp mused.   said Samwell sounding as gloomy as Dolorous Edd, "
6970,Jon,Satin,"Get your shield up,Its too heavy,Its as heavy as it needs to be to stop a sword,Now get it up."
6971,Jon,Satin,"Good,That was good."
6972,Craster,Qhorin,    Instead Satin took a step backward and raised his visor.
6973,Jon,Melisandre,"my lady.The king would speak with you, Jon Snow."
6974,Jon,Melisandre,"Might I be allowed to change?I am in no fit state to stand  before a king.We shall await you atop the Wall,"
6975,Jon,Melisandre,What does  His Grace want of me?
6976,Jon,Melisandre,"All you have to give, Jon Snow.He is a king."
6977,Jon,Melisandre,"You are not cold, my lady?"
6978,Jon,Melisandre,Never.
6979,Jon,Stannis,"The  Lords fire lives within me, Jon Snow.Feel."
6980,Jon,Stannis,"That is how life should feel,Only death is cold."
6981,Melisandre,Stannis,"I have brought you  the Bastard of Winterfell, Your Grace,"
6982,Jon,Qhorin,"Rise.I have heard much and more of you, Lord Snow.I am no lord, sire."
6983,Jon,Qhorin,I know what you have heard.
6984,Qhorin,Stannis,"That I rode with Mance Rayder,  and took a wildling wife.Aye."
6985,Qhorin,Stannis,"You are a warg too, they say, a skinchanger who walks at night as a wolf."
6986,Qhorin,Stannis,"How much of it is true?I had a direwolf, Ghost."
6987,Stannis,Ygritte,"I broke my  vows with her, but I swear to you on my fathers name that I never turned my cloak.I believe you,"
6988,Eddard,Stannis,Why?
6989,Eddard,Stannis,I know Janos Slynt.
6990,Jon,Stannis,You have his look.
6991,Jon,Stannis,"I know more than  you might think, Jon Snow.I know it was you who found the dragonglass dagger that Randyll Tarlys son  used to slay the Other.Ghost found it."
6992,Jon,Stannis,"There were other blades as well ... spearheads, arrowheads, all dragonglass.I know you held the gate here,If not, I would have come too late.Donal Noye held the gate.He died below in the tunnel, fighting the king of the giants."
6993,Jon,Stannis,"Noye made my first sword for me, and Roberts warharnmer as well.Had the god  seen fit to spare him, he would have made a better Lord Commander for your order than any of these  fools who are squabbling over it now.Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister are no fools, sire,Theyre good men, and capable."
6994,Jon,Othell,Lord Mormont trusted each of them.Your Lord Mormont trusted too easily.
6995,Jon,Othell,"I have not forgotten that it was you who brought us this magic horn, and captured Mance  Rayders wife and son.Dalla died."
6996,Jon,Melisandre,Val is her sister.
6997,Jon,Melisandre,"You had put the wildlings; to flight, and the skinchanger Mance had left to guard  his queen went mad when the eagle burned."
6998,Jon,Melisandre,Some say that was your doing.
6999,Jon,Melisandre,"The Lord of Light has fiery talons, Jon  Snow."
7000,Jon,Mance,"Your Grace, you spoke of Val."
7001,Jon,Mance,it would be a ... a kindness.The man is a deserter from your order.
7002,Jon,Mance,Why should I do him  a kindness?
7003,Cersei,Jon,"If not for him, for Val.For her sisters sake, the childs mother.You are fond of this Val?I scarcely know her.They tell me she is comely.Very,"
7004,Cersei,Jon,Your father and Jon Arryn as well.
7005,Cersei,Jon,"You rode with these wildlings.Is there  any honor in them, do you think?Yes,but their own sort of honor, sire.In Mance Rayder?Yes.I think so.In the Lord of Bones?"
7006,Jon,Stannis,"Rattleshirt, we called him."
7007,Jon,Stannis,"If theres honor in him, he hides  it down beneath his suit of bones.And this other man, this Tormund of the many names who eluded us after the battle?Answer me truly.Tormund Giantsbane seemed to me the sort of man who would make a good friend and a bad enemy,  Your Grace."
7008,Jon,Stannis,Your father was a man of honor.
7009,Jon,Stannis,What of you?
7010,Jon,Stannis,I am a man of the  Nights Watch.Words.
7011,Jon,Stannis,"Why do you think I abandoned Dragonstone and sailed to the Wall, Lord  Snow?I am no lord, sire."
7012,Craster,Qhorin,"  Surprisingly, Stannis smiled at that."
7013,Davos,Stannis,"I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the  kingdom to win the throne."
7014,Melisandre,Stannis,"There is where Ill find the foe that I was bom to  fight.His name may not be spoken,He is the God of Night and Terror, Jon  Snow, and these shapes in the snow are his creatures.They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormonts life,it  may be that this is your war as well, Lord Snow.If you will give me your help.My sword is pledged to the Nights Watch, Your Grace,"
7015,Jon,Stannis,I need more than a sword from you.
7016,Jon,Stannis,My lord?I need the north.
7017,Jon,Stannis,I ... my brother Robb was King in the North .
7018,Jon,Stannis,Your brother was the rightful Lord of Winterfell.
7019,Jon,Stannis,"You  are not Robb, no more than I am Robert."
7020,Jon,Stannis,"I loved my  brother,And I mine."
7021,Balon,Stannis,And you are Eddard Starks bastard.
7022,Balon,Stannis,"Tywin  Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North, to reward him for betraying your brother."
7023,Jon,Stannis,A  loyal Lord of Winterfell.
7024,Jon,Stannis,"Winterfell is no more.Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.Granite does not bum easily,The castle can be rebuilt, in time."
7025,Jon,Stannis,I need a son of Eddard Stark to win them to my banner.
7026,Melisandre,Stannis,"Your Grace,you forget."
7027,Alliser,Jon,"A king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke, Lord  Snow."
7028,Jon,Melisandre,"Yes,"
7029,Jon,Melisandre,I knelt before a  heart tree and swore to hold no lands and father no children.Jon.
7030,Jon,Melisandre,Rhllor is the only true god.
7031,Jon,Melisandre,"Bum these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light."
7032,Jon,Stannis,"It may be that I am  mistaken in you, Jon Snow."
7033,Jon,Tormund,"And the more  we bleed each other, the weaker we shall all be when the real enemy falls upon us."
7034,Jon,Tormund,"As you say, Your Grace."
7035,Jon,Tormund,"Whilst your brothers have been struggling to decide who shall lead them, I have been speaking with this  Mance Rayder."
7036,Jon,Tormund,"A stubborn man, that one, and prideful."
7037,Jon,Ygritte,It is time we made alliance against our common foe.
7038,Jon,Ygritte,"Would you agree?  My father dreamed of resettling the Gift,He and my uncle Benjen used to talk of it."
7039,Jon,Ygritte,"I agree.Good,for the surest way to seal a new alliance is with a marriage."
7040,Jon,Stannis,"Your Grace,"
7041,Jon,Stannis,. Whoever?
7042,Jon,Stannis,Does this mean you will not wed the girl?
7043,Jon,Stannis,"Are you refusing me, Jon Snow?No,"
7044,Jon,Stannis,"I mean ... this has all come very suddenly, Your Grace.Might I beg you for some time to  consider?As you wish."
7045,Jon,Stannis,"I am not a patient man, as your black brothers are about to  discover."
7046,Jon,Stannis,Say nothing of what weve discussed here  today.
7047,Jon,Stannis,"But when you return, you need only bend your knee, lay your sword at my feet, and  pledge yourself to my service, and you shall rise again as Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell."
7048,Jaime,Tyrion,Bugger you all
7049,Jaime,Tyrion,"Come on, are you frightened of a    dwarf?Do it, you son of a poxy whore."
7050,Jaime,Tyrion,Is that any way to speak about our lady mother?
7051,Jaime,Tyrion,"This is even more ghastly than my cell at Riverrun, though not quite so dank."
7052,Jaime,Tyrion,"You?Well, most of me."
7053,Jaime,Tyrion,I left a hand at Harrenhal.Bringing the  Brave Companions across the narrow sea was not one of Fathers better notions.
7054,Jaime,Tyrion,"Oh, gods,Jaime, I am so sorry, but ... gods  be good, look at the two of us.Handless and Noseless the Lannister boys.There were days when my hand smelled so bad I wished I was noseless."
7055,Jaime,Tyrion,An impressive scar.
7056,Jaime,Tyrion,They made me fight a battle without my big brother to protect me.I heard tell you almost burned the city down.A filthy lie.I only burned the river.
7057,Jaime,Tyrion,"Are you  here to kill me?Now thats ungrateful.Perhaps I should leave you here to rot if youre going to be so discourteous.Rotting is not the fate Cersei has in mind for me.Well no, if truth be told.Youre to be beheaded on the morrow, out on the old tourney grounds."
7058,Jaime,Tyrion,"Will there be food?Youll have to help me with my last words, my wits have been  running about like a rat in a root cellar.You wont need last words.Im rescuing you."
7059,Jaime,Tyrion,"Who said I required rescue?You know, Id almost forgotten what an annoying little man you are.Now that youve reminded me, I  do believe Ill let Cersei cut your head off after all.Oh no you wont."
7060,Jaime,Tyrion,Is it day or night up above?Ive lost all sense of time.Three hours past midnight.The city sleeps.
7061,Jaime,Tyrion,Is he dead?Asleep.
7062,Cersei,Jaime,You might do well to take another name.Another name?
7063,Cersei,Jaime,"And when the Faceless Men come to  kill me, Ill say, No, you have the wrong man, Im a different dwarf with a hideous facial scar."
7064,Jaime,Tyrion,"Thank you, Brother,For my life.It was ... a debt I owed you."
7065,Jaime,Tyrion,A debt?
7066,Jaime,Tyrion,"I do not understand.Good.Some doors are best left closed.Oh, dear,Is there something grim and ugly behind it?"
7067,Jaime,Tyrion,"Tell me.Tyrion...Tell me,"
7068,Tyrion,Tysha,"Tysha,Tysha?"
7069,Tyrion,Tysha,What of her?She was no whore.
7070,Tyrion,Tysha,"A crofters daughter, chance met on the road."
7071,Sansa,Tysha,"My wife,She wed me.For your gold, Father said."
7072,Sansa,Tyrion,. Thank you?
7073,Jaime,Tyrion,He gave her to his guards.
7074,Jaime,Tyrion,watch.
7075,Craster,Qhorin,I never knew he would do that. Tyrion snarled.
7076,Jaime,Tyrion,"I ...I  suppose I earned that.Oh, youve earned more than that, Jaime."
7077,Jaime,Tyrion,A Lannister always pays his  debts.
7078,Jaime,Tyrion,I have the gaolers keys.Then use them.
7079,Jaime,Tyrion,Are  you coming?Not with you.
7080,Jaime,Tyrion,Give me the keys and go.I will find Varys on my own.
7081,Jaime,Tyrion,"Jaime, can you flght  left-handed?Rather less well than you,Good."
7082,Jaime,Tyrion,The cripple and the dwarf.
7083,Jaime,Tyrion,I gave you the truth.
7084,Jaime,Tyrion,Did you  kill him?
7085,Joffrey,Tyrion,Are you sure you want to know?
7086,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Joffrey would have been a worse king than Aerys ever was.He stole his fathers dagger and gave it to a  footpad to slit the throat of Brandon Stark, did you know that?I ...I thought he might have.Well, a son takes after his father."
7087,Cersei,Joffrey,"For  the crime of being short and ugly, of which I am so conspicuously guilty.You have not answered my question.You poor stupid blind crippled fool."
7088,Moon,Osmund,"Yes, I killed your vile son."
7089,Tyrion,Varys,"You were so long, I feared that something had gone amiss,Oh, no,What could possibly have gone amiss?"
7090,Tyrion,Varys,I sent for you during my trial.I could not come.
7091,Tyrion,Varys,I dared not help you.Youre helping me now.Am I?Ah.
7092,Tyrion,Varys,"Your brother can be most persuasive.Varys, you are as cold and slimy as a slug, has anyone ever told you?"
7093,Tyrion,Varys,Perhaps I ought to return the favor.
7094,Tyrion,Varys,"The faithful dog is kicked, and no matter how the spider weaves, he is never loved."
7095,Dontos,Tyrion,You may never find your way back to daylight.
7096,Dontos,Tyrion,These tunnels are full of traps for the unwary.
7097,Dontos,Tyrion,"Unwary?Im the wariest man who ever lived, you helped see to that."
7098,Dontos,Tyrion,"So tell me, wizard, where is my innocent maiden wife?I have found no trace of Lady Sansa in Kings Landing sad to say."
7099,Tyrion,Varys,My little birds are silent.
7100,Tyrion,Varys,"My lord, we must away.Your  path is down."
7101,Tyrion,Varys,What part of the dungeons are these?
7102,Tyrion,Varys,"Maegor the Cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for his castle,On the upper level,  there are large cells where common criminals may be confined together."
7103,Tyrion,Varys,Maegor had the  cells on the fourth level built for torment.
7104,Tyrion,Varys,This is the fourth level.
7105,Tyrion,Varys,There are things you would not wish to see.
7106,Tyrion,Varys,"Careful, there are three steps ahead,The    tunnel slopes downward here, my lord."
7107,Shae,Varys,We are below the Tower of the Hand.Yes.
7108,Tyrion,Varys,This will take us out to the river.
7109,Tyrion,Varys,This will take me up to my  bedchamber.Your lord fathers bedchamber now.
7110,Tyrion,Varys,"How far must I climb?My lord, you are too weak for such follies, and there is besides no time.We must go.I have business above.How far?Two hundred and thirty rungs, but whatever you intend    "
7111,Tyrion,Varys,No more than sixty feet.
7112,Tyrion,Varys,The  bedchamber is the third.
7113,Tyrion,Varys,"This is folly, my lord."
7114,Tyrion,Varys,"Would you cast it away, and mine with it?Varys, the only thing I value less than my life just now is yours.Wait for me here."
7115,Small,Tyrion,"Most like  its got a crook in it,"
7116,Small,Tyrion,"Hell weep like a woman and beg for mercy, youll see,"
7117,Small,Tyrion,"Ah, shit in your boots,you know theyd never fit these feet Wmine."
7118,Big,Tyrion,Mlord?
7119,Big,Tyrion,"Were you expecting someone taller, sweetling?"
7120,Big,Tyrion,"I never meant those things I said, the queen made me."
7121,Big,Tyrion,Your father  frightens me so.
7122,Big,Tyrion,"My lady Shae,All the time I sat in the black cell waiting to die, I kept remembering  how beautiful you were.  You should go, or ... did you come to take me away?Did you ever like it?"
7123,Tyrion,Tywin,"Did you ever like my touch?More than anything,my giant of Lannister."
7124,Tyrion,Tywin,"For  hands of gold are always cold, but a womans hands are warm,"
7125,Tyrion,Tywin,My lord.Tyrion.
7126,Tyrion,Tywin,"Who released you from your cell?Id love to tell you, but I swore a holy oath.The eunuch,Ill have his head for this."
7127,Tyrion,Tywin,"Put it down.Will you punish me if I refuse, Father?This escape is folly."
7128,Tyrion,Tywin,Put down the crossbow and we will go  back to my chambers and talk of it.We can talk here just as well.
7129,Tyrion,Tywin,"One simple question, you owe me that much.I owe you nothing.Youve given me less than that, all my life, but youll give me this.What did you do with Tysha?Tysha?"
7130,Tyrion,Tywin,"The girl I married.Oh, yes.Your first whore."
7131,Tyrion,Tywin,"The next time you say that word, Ill kill you.You do not have the courage.Shall we find out?Its a short word, and it seems to come so easily to your lips."
7132,Tyrion,Tywin,"Tysha.What did you do with her, after my little lesson?I dont recall.Try harder.Did you have her killed?"
7133,Tyrion,Tywin,"There was no reason for that, shed learned her place ... and had been well  paid for her days work, I seem to recall."
7134,Tyrion,Tywin,I never thought to  inquire.On her way where?Wherever whores go.
7135,Tyrion,Tywin,"You shot me,You always were quick to grasp a situation, my lord,That must be why youre the Hand  of the King.You ... you are no ... no son of mine.Now thats where youre wrong, Father."
7136,Tyrion,Tywin,I have a ship to catch.
7137,Aemon,Samwell,"Rise,"
7138,Aemon,Janos,"Your Grace, let me say  how pleased we are to be summoned here."
7139,Alliser,Stannis,   Stannis snapped.
7140,Alliser,Stannis,Lady Melisandre tells me that you have not yet chosen  a Lord Commander.
7141,Alliser,Stannis,"How much longer must this folly last?Sire,no one has achieved two-thirds of the vote yet."
7142,Janos,Stannis,"By rights your Lord Commander should  have a voice in those decisions.He should, yes,But it must be said."
7143,Cotter,Denys,To help them choose wisely.
7144,Cotter,Denys,Do you want the king to wipe our arses for us too?
7145,Cotter,Denys,"The choice of a Lord Commander belongs to the Sworn Brothers, and to them  alone,If they choose wisely they wont be choosing me,Your Grace, the Nights Watch has been  choosing its own leader since Brandon the Builder raised the Wall."
7146,Janos,Stannis,"It is not my wish to tamper with your rights and traditions.As to royal  guidance, Janos, if you mean that I ought to tell your brothers to choose you, have the courage to say  so."
7147,Bowen,Janos,"Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?Any of you, I would think.Even the cook."
7148,Bowen,Janos,"Janos was hardly  the first gold cloak ever to take a bribe, I grant you, but he may have been the first commander to fatten  his purse by selling places and promotions."
7149,Bowen,Stannis,"Isnt that so, Janos? "
7150,Jon,Stannis,"Lies, all lies!"
7151,Jon,Stannis,  
7152,Jon,Stannis,"Do not trifle with me, my lord."
7153,Aemon,Petyr,"Petyr had a nose for gold, and  Im certain he arranged matters so the crown profited as much from your corruption as you did yourself.Your Grace, by law a mans past crimes and transgressions are wiped clean when he says his words and  becomes a Sworn Brother of the Nights Watch.I am aware of that."
7154,Denys,Janos,"We have a war to fight.Your Grace,If you are speaking of the wildlings ."
7155,Cotter,Denys,". I am not.And you know that, ser.And you must know that whilst we are thankful for the aid you rendered us against Mance Rayder, we  can offer you no help in your contest for the throne."
7156,Cotter,Stannis,   the king said brusquely. said Cotter Pyke.
7157,Cotter,Stannis,I shall require a few other things from you as well.
7158,Cotter,Stannis,And I want the Gift.
7159,Craster,Qhorin,I have three times the men you do. Bowen Marsh insisted.
7160,Bowen,Cotter,Make better use of it than you have.
7161,Bowen,Othell,"Garrison them as you always have, but I must take the others for my garrisons  if we are to hold the Wall.You do not have the men,Some of the abandoned castles are scarce more than ruins,Ruins can be rebuilt.Rebuilt?"
7162,Bowen,Othell,But who will do the work?That is my concern.
7163,Bowen,Melisandre,"I mean to have them all garrisoned again within the year, and nightfires  burning before their gates.Nightfires?"
7164,Bowen,Melisandre,Were to light nightfires now?You are.
7165,Bowen,Melisandre,Swords alone cannot hold this darkness back.
7166,Bowen,Samwell,"Ours is a war for life itself, and should we fail the world dies with us."
7167,Craster,Qhorin,"It  is the war for the dawn you speak of, my lady. Melisandre declared, "
7168,Samwell,Stannis,"The red comet  blazed across the sky to herald his coming, and he bears Lightbringer, the red sword of heroes."
7169,Craster,Qhorin,
7170,Samwell,Stannis,Best get used to  that.
7171,Samwell,Stannis,Thats all.
7172,Samwell,Stannis,The rest of you  may go.
7173,Melisandre,Stannis,"You are the one that killed the creature in the snow,Samwellthe Slayer."
7174,Melisandre,Samwell,"No, my lady."
7175,Mace,Stannis,"Im Samwell Tarly, yes.Your father is an able soldier,He defeated my brother once, at Ashford."
7176,Randyll,Stannis,He slew Lord Cafferen with that great Valyrian sword of his and sent his  head to Aerys.
7177,Aemon,Stannis,"You are not the sort of son I would expect such a  man to have.I ...I am not the sort of son he wanted, sire.if you had not taken the black, you would make a useful hostage,He has taken the black, sire,I am well aware of that,I am aware of more than you know, Aemon Targaryen."
7178,Aemon,Stannis,"I am only Aemon, sire.We give up our House names when we forge our  maesters chains."
7179,Aemon,Stannis,"You slew this creature with an  obsidian dagger, I am told,Y-yes, Your Grace."
7180,Aemon,Samwell,"Frozen fire, in the tongue of old Valyria.Small  wonder it is anathema to these cold children of the other.On Dragonstone, where I had my seat, there is much of this obsidian to be seen in the old tunnels  beneath the mountain,"
7181,Melisandre,Samwell,"I will not hold Dragonstone for very much longer, I fear, but perhaps the Lord  of Light shall grant us enough frozen fre to arm ourselves against these creatures, before the castle falls."
7182,Melisandre,Samwell,S-sire.The dagger ... the dragonglass only shattered when I tried to stab a  wight.
7183,Melisandre,Samwell,"Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh."
7184,Melisandre,Stannis,"The ones you call the Others are something more.Demons made of snow and ice and cold,The ancient enemy.The only enemy  that matters."
7185,Samwell,Stannis,"I am told that you and this wildling girl passed beneath the  Wall, through some magic gate.The B-black Gate,Below the Nightfort.The Nightfort is the largest and oldest of the castles on the Wall,That is where I intend  to make my seat, whilst I fight this war.You will show me this gate.I,I w-will, if..."
7186,Aemon,Stannis,"You will,I shall tell you when."
7187,Aemon,Stannis,"Your Grace,before we go, I wonder if you would do us the great  honor of showing us this wondrous blade we have all heard so very much of.You want to see Lightbringer?A blind man?Samwellshall be my eyes."
7188,Aemon,Stannis,"Everyone else has seen the thing, why not a blind man?"
7189,Aemon,Samwell,"Tell me, Samwell."
7190,Aemon,Samwell,"It glows,As if it were on fire."
7191,Samwell,Stannis,"I wish you could see  it, Maester.I see it now, Samwell A sword full of sunlight.So lovely to behold."
7192,Samwell,Stannis,Your  Grace.
7193,Samwell,Stannis,This was most kind of you. 
7194,Aemon,Samwell,"Very well, youve seen it."
7195,Aemon,Samwell,"Your brothers will chose a Lord Commander tonight, or I shall make them wish  they had."
7196,Craster,Qhorin,"I felt no heat.Did you, SamwellHeat?"
7197,Aemon,Samwell,"The air around it was shimmering, the way it does above a  hot brazier.Yet you felt no heat, did you?"
7198,Aemon,Samwell,"Was the leather scorched, Samwell Did the wood  seem burnt or blackened? No,Not that I could see."
7199,Aemon,Samwell,"it is hard to be so old,And harder still to be  so blind."
7200,Aemon,Janos,I miss books most of all.
7201,Aemon,Janos,"I shall have no  more need of you till the choosing.The choosing ... Maester, isnt there something you could do?"
7202,Janos,Samwell,". I recall,"
7203,Aemon,Samwell,"It would not be proper for me to be seen to favor one  contender over another.Im not a maester,Could I do something?"
7204,Aemon,Samwell,"Why, I dont know, Samwell.Could you?"
7205,Cotter,Samwell,Samwellthe Slayer!
7206,Cotter,Samwell,"Are you sure you stabbed an Other, and not some childs  snow knight?"
7207,Aemon,Samwell,"it was the dragonglass that killed it, my lord,Aye, no doubt."
7208,Aemon,Samwell,Did the maester send you to me?The maester?
7209,Aemon,Samwell,"I ...I just left him, my lord."
7210,Aemon,Samwell,"You want me to kneel down and kiss the hem of  Mallisters pretty cloak, is that it?"
7211,Aemon,Samwell,"We choose him, and were like to be  back here in a year, choosing someone else.Hes old,but hes well ex-experienced.At sitting in his tower and fussing over maps, maybe."
7212,Bowen,Samwell,You think Mallister has the belly to    stand up to Stannis Baratheon and that red bitch?
7213,Bowen,Samwell,"I dont.You wont support him, then?"
7214,Bowen,Samwell,"Are you Samwellthe Slayer or Deaf Dick?No, I wont support him."
7215,Bowen,Samwell,"Understand this, boy."
7216,Bowen,Samwell,"And you can run back to the  old man and tell him I said so, if he asks."
7217,Bowen,Samwell,Get out of my sight.W-what if there was someone else?
7218,Samwell,Stannis,A toad grows wings and thinks hes a bloody dragon.
7219,Samwell,Stannis,"Who does that leave,  Hobb?"
7220,Denys,Samwell,You look like  a man who likes his bloody mutton.
7221,Aemon,Samwell,"My lord of Tarly,I am pleased to see that youve recovered from your ordeal."
7222,Aemon,Samwell,Does he have counsel to offer me?
7223,Aemon,Samwell,A maester  chained and sworn ... it would not be proper for him to be seen as having influenced the choice of Lord  Commander.
7224,Aemon,Samwell,. 
7225,Aemon,Samwell,Which is why he has not come to me himself.
7226,Aemon,Denys,Say what you came to say.
7227,Cotter,Samwell,I agree that it would be a dark day in our history if a  king were to name our Lord Commander.
7228,Cotter,Samwell,"I have more support than he does, and I am  better suited to the office.You are,but Cotter Pyke might serve."
7229,Aemon,Denys,Many of my brothers have proved themselves in battle.
7230,Cotter,Denys,He must be a man worthy of respect.
7231,Cotter,Denys,"We are the  sons of great lords, you and I."
7232,Denys,Samwell,"No, loath as I am to disappoint  Maester Aemon, I could not in honor stand aside for Pyke of Eastwatch."
7233,Denys,Samwell,Might you for someone else?If it was someone more suitable?
7234,Denys,Samwell,I have never desired the honor for its own sake.
7235,Donal,Samwell,"Small wonder he is venal and corrupt.Theres another man,Lord Commander Mormont trusted him."
7236,Denys,Qhorin,"His father was a lord, and his brother a king."
7237,Denys,Samwell,"Mayhaps,He is very young,  but ... mayhaps."
7238,Samwell,Stannis,I  would be the wiser choice.
7239,Craster,Qhorin,"If we do not choose  a Lord Commander tonight, King Stannis means to name Cotter Pyke."
7240,Denys,Samwell,I must think on this.
7241,Denys,Samwell,And give my thanks to Maester  Aemon as well.
7242,Samwell,Small,"You again?Make it quick, you are starting to annoy me.I only need a moment more,You wont withdraw for Ser Denys, you said, but you  might for someone else.Who is it this time, Slayer?You?No."
7243,Cotter,Donal,"The only thing is, hes bastard-born."
7244,Cotter,Donal,Bloody hell.
7245,Cotter,Stannis,How bad could the boy be?
7246,Denys,Stannis,"Id be better, though.Im whats needed,  any fool can see that.Any fool,"
7247,Denys,Stannis,"I heard him tell Maester Aemon that, after the  rest of you were sent away."
7248,Jon,Robb,"Im Prince  Aemon the Dragonknight,Well, Im Florian the Fool.Im the Young Dragon,Im Ser Ryam Redwyne."
7249,Jon,Robb,Im Lord of Winterfell!
7250,Craster,Qhorin,"You cant be Lord of Winterfell, youre bastard-born."
7251,Emmett,Jon,"Jon, enough,hes down, you disarmed him."
7252,Emmett,Jon,"Im sorry,Emmett, are you  hurt?"
7253,Emmett,Jon,"Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend,  Lord Snow?"
7254,Emmett,Jon,"Warrior defend me,now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt."
7255,Alliser,Tywin,"I dont know,Maybe if I knew the man better ... Lord Stannis didnt  have much good to say of him, Ill tell you that.When has Stannis Baratheon ever had much good to say of anyone?"
7256,Alliser,Tywin,"If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander, we become his bannermen in all but    name."
7257,Bowen,Tywin,"Hes already beaten Stannis once, on the Blackwater.Lord Tywin favors Slynt,I can show you his letter,  Othell.Our faithful friend and servant he called him."
7258,Bowen,Jon,"My lords,What are you doing here, bastard?"
7259,Bowen,Jon,Bathing.But dont let me spoil your plotting.
7260,Chett,Jon,Ghost?
7261,Chett,Jon,Ghost!
7262,Jon,Melisandre,"Gods, wolf, where have you been?"
7263,Jon,Melisandre,"I thought youd died on me, like Robb and Ygritte and all the  rest.Ive had no sense of you, not since I climbed the Wall, not even in dreams."
7264,Jon,Melisandre,"Come,  Ghost,With me."
7265,Jon,Melisandre,I could feel it.
7266,Janos,Jon,"Move aside and let them pass.Youre late for your supper.Then get out of my way, ser,"
7267,Alliser,Janos,The tumcloak graces us with his presence at last.
7268,Alliser,Janos,"The beast,Look!"
7269,Aemon,Jon,This beastling is not fit to live!
7270,Aemon,Jon,"My lord,will you tell me whats  happened here?"
7271,Aemon,Jon,"Your name has been put forth as Lord  Commander, Jon."
7272,Aemon,Jon,By who?
7273,Janos,Mance,"By me.Aye, its a terrible cruel thing to do to a friend, but better you than me."
7274,Janos,Mance,"This, this is an outrage."
7275,Cotter,Mance,"I will  not have it, I will not suffer it!"
7276,Cotter,Denys,"You wont suffer it?Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your  bloody arse, but youre wearing a black cloak now.Any brother may offer any name for our consideration, so long as the man has said his vows,Tollett is well within his rights, my lord."
7277,Alliser,Othell,Brothers!
7278,Alliser,Othell,"We will choose, and choose again,  all night if need be, until we have our lord ... but before we cast our tokens, I believe our First Builder has  something to say to us."
7279,Craster,Qhorin,
7280,Alliser,Janos,. 
7281,Alliser,Janos,Lord Slynt is the best possible   Yarwyck complained.
7282,Alliser,Cotter,". Hes never seen Harrenhal,Well, thats so,Anyway, now that Im standing here, I dont recall why I thought Slynt  would be such a good choice."
7283,Janos,Stannis,"Hes been longer on the Wall, hes Ben Starks  nephew, and he served the Old Bear as squire."
7284,Janos,Jon,"Pick who you want, just so its not  me."
7285,Aemon,Alliser,Kettle!
7286,Aemon,Samwell,"Kettle, kettle, KETTLE!"
7287,Craster,Qhorin,I know that bird!
7288,Jon,Samwell,"Snow,"
7289,Janos,Jon,"Snow,Snow, snow, snow"
7290,Alliser,Janos,"Ser Piggy thinks were all fools, brothers,Hes taught the bird this little trick."
7291,Alliser,Jon,Mormonts bird had more words than that.
7292,Alliser,Jon,Corn?
7293,Craster,Qhorin,
7294,Alliser,Jon,Kettle?
7295,Dywen,Emmett,"Gods be good, our Lord Commanders still in swaddling  clothes.I hope this dont mean I cant beat the bloody piss out of you next time we  train, my lord."
7296,Bowen,Denys,"Lord Snow,if you muck this up, Im going to rip your liver out and eat it raw with  onions."
7297,Bowen,Denys,"It was a hard thing young Samwell asked of me,When Lord Qorgyle was chosen, I told myself, No matter, he has been longer on the  Wall than you have, your time will come."
7298,Cotter,Denys,"But you are half a boy, Lord Snow, and now I must return  to the Shadow Tower knowing that my time will never come."
7299,Cotter,Denys,Do not make me  die regretful.
7300,Cotter,Hobb,"I shall expect full as  much of you.Aye,And you can start by telling those kings men that its done, and we want our  bloody supper.Supper,Supper, supper."
7301,Grenn,Samwell,"Samwelldid  it,Samwelldid it!"
7302,Janos,Samwell,"I had nothing to do with the bird,When it flew out of the kettle I almost wet myself."
7303,Jon,Samwell,"Youre all a bunch of mad fools, do you know  that?Us?"
7304,Jon,Samwell,You call us fools?
7305,Jon,Samwell,I think youre going to need a lot of wine.
7306,Petyr,Sansa,"Pack the snow around a stick, Sansa."
7307,Petyr,Sansa,A  stick?
7308,Petyr,Sansa,"That will give it strength enough to stand, Id think,May I come into your castle, my lady?"
7309,Petyr,Sansa,Dont break it.
7310,Petyr,Sansa,.
7311,Petyr,Sansa,gentle?
7312,Petyr,Sansa,"Winterfell has withstood flercer enemies than me.It is Winterfell, is it not?Yes,"
7313,Petyr,Sansa,"I used to dream of it, in those years after Cat went north with  Eddard Stark.In my dreams it was ever a dark place, and cold.No."
7314,Petyr,Sansa,"Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls  to warm them, and inside the glass gardens it was always like the hottest day of summer."
7315,Lysa,Petyr,I cant think how to do the glass roof over the gardens.
7316,Lysa,Petyr,"The  glass was locked in frames, no?"
7317,Lysa,Petyr,Ill show you.
7318,Petyr,Sansa,"We will need to imagine the glass, to be sure,This is just right,"
7319,Petyr,Sansa,And so is that.
7320,Petyr,Sansa,"And so is what?Your smile, my lady.Shall I make another for you?If you would.,,  "
7321,Petyr,Sansa,"Its been snowing on your castle, my lady,What do the gargoyles look  like when theyre covered with snow?"
7322,Petyr,Sansa,"Theyre just white lumps.Well, then.Gargoyles are hard, but white lumps should be easy."
7323,Petyr,Sansa,"That was unchivalrously  done, my lady.As was bringing me here, when you swore to take me home."
7324,Petyr,Sansa,"Yes, I played you false in that ... and in one other thing as well."
7325,Petyr,Sansa,What other thing?I told you that nothing could please me more than to help you with your castle.
7326,Petyr,Sansa,Something else would please me more.
7327,Petyr,Sansa,This.
7328,Petyr,Sansa,What are you doing?
7329,Petyr,Sansa,Kissing a snow maid.Youre supposed to kiss her.
7330,Lysa,Sansa,Your lady  wife.I do.Lysa has no cause for complaint.
7331,Lysa,Sansa,"I wish you could see yourself, my lady."
7332,Marillion,Sansa,"Take off those gloves, give me your hands.I wont."
7333,Lothor,Petyr,You shouldnt kiss me.
7334,Eddard,Petyr,". Might have been,But youre not, are you?"
7335,Eddard,Petyr,"But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was, when she was  your age.Petyr, please."
7336,Eddard,Sansa,Please.A castle!
7337,Robert,Sansa,Lord Robert.
7338,Robert,Sansa,"Should you be out in the snow without your gloves?Did you make the snow castle, Lord Petyr?Alayne did most of it, my lord.Its meant to be Winterfell.Winterfell?"
7339,Robert,Sansa,"Winterfell is the seat of House Stark,The great castle of the north.Its not so great."
7340,Robert,Sansa,"Look, here comes a giant to knock it down."
7341,Robert,Sansa,"Tromp tromp Im a giant, Im a giant,Ho  ho ho, open yourgates or Ill mash them and smash them."
7342,Robert,Sansa,"Robert, stop that."
7343,Robert,Sansa,"You killed him,"
7344,Colemon,Sansa,"Help him to my chambers,A leeching will help calm him.It was my fault."
7345,Petyr,Sansa,I ripped his doll in two.
7346,Petyr,Sansa,".  His lordship was destroying the castle,A giant,It wasnt me, it was a giant hurt the castle."
7347,Colemon,Sansa,"I dont want to be leeched!My lord, your blood needs thinning,It is the bad blood that makes you angry,  and the rage that brings on the shaking.Come now."
7348,Petyr,Sansa,"If the tales be true, thats not the first giant to end up with his head on Winterfells  walls.Those are only stories,"
7349,Marillion,Sansa,Lady Lysa requires  your presence in the High Hall.
7350,Lysa,Sansa,"Thank you,I know the way."
7351,Petyr,Sansa,My lady said to bring you.
7352,Lothor,Petyr,Are you a guardsman now?
7353,Lothor,Marillion,Do you require guarding?
7354,Lothor,Marillion,"I am composing a new song, you should know."
7355,Lothor,Marillion,About a  basebom girl so beautiful she bewitched every man who laid eyes upon her.
7356,Marillion,Sansa,"No  one is to enter so long as Alayne is with Lady Lysa,Aye."
7357,Lysa,Sansa,Why did you do that?My lady awaits you.
7358,Marillion,Sansa,My lady.You sent for me.
7359,Lysa,Sansa,"I saw what you did,"
7360,Lysa,Sansa,I trust Lord Robert is better?
7361,Lysa,Sansa,  
7362,Lysa,Sansa,I was not speaking of Roberts doll.I saw you  kissing him.
7363,Lysa,Sansa,He kissed me.
7364,Lysa,Sansa,And why would he do that?
7365,Robert,Sansa,That was the  way of it.
7366,Robert,Sansa,Thats not true.Where are you going?
7367,Robert,Sansa,"I cannot abide a liar, Alayne.I was building a snow castle,Lord Petyr was helping me, and then he kissed me.Thats  what you saw.Have you no honor?"
7368,Marillion,Sansa,Or do you take me for a fool?
7369,Catelyn,Petyr,He is mine.
7370,Catelyn,Petyr,They all tried to take him from me.
7371,Catelyn,Sansa,"She  liked to kiss my Petyr too, oh yes she did."
7372,Catelyn,Sansa,"My mother?Yes, your mother, your precious mother, my own sweet sister Catelyn."
7373,Lysa,Petyr,"She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks, and made his nights a torment.No."
7374,Lysa,Petyr,She didnt.She wouldnt.How would you know?Were you there?
7375,Catelyn,Lysa,"Did  you come with Lord Bracken and Lord Blackwood, the time they visited to lay their feud before my    father?"
7376,Brynden,Sansa,"But you remember none of it, do you?"
7377,Brynden,Sansa,Do you?
7378,Brynden,Sansa,"I was not born, my lady.You were not bom."
7379,Brynden,Sansa,"You kissed  him!He kissed me,I never wanted  "
7380,Lysa,Sansa,Not Catelyns and not  yours.
7381,Cersei,Lysa,"Hes yours, my lady,May I have your leave to go?You may not."
7382,Moon,Nestor,"If you were anyone else, I would banish you."
7383,Jon,Lysa,"We made a baby together,  a precious little baby."
7384,Jon,Robert,"When they    stole him from me, I made a promise to myself that I would never let it happen again."
7385,Petyr,Sansa,"Do you hear what I am telling you?Yes.I swear, I wont ever kiss him again, or ... or entice him."
7386,Lysa,Sansa,So you admit it now?
7387,Lysa,Sansa,You are as wanton as your mother.
7388,Lysa,Sansa,Come with me now.There is something I want to show you.Youre hurting me.
7389,Lysa,Sansa,"Please, Aunt Lysa, I havent done anything.I swear it."
7390,Lysa,Sansa,Marillion!
7391,Lysa,Sansa,"I need you, Marillion!I need you!"
7392,Lysa,Marillion,My lady?Play us a song.Play The False and the Fair.
7393,Lysa,Sansa,"The lord he came a-riding upon a rainy day, hey-nonny,  hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey..."
7394,Lysa,Marillion,The  Moon Door.
7395,Lysa,Marillion,"Why are you showing me the Moon Door?You squeak like a mouse now, but you were bold enough in the garden, werent you?You were bold  enough in the snow.The lady sat a-sewing upon a rainy day,Heynonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey.Open the door,Open it, I say.You will do it, or Ill send for my guards."
7396,Lysa,Sansa,"Your mother was brave, at least.Lift off the bars."
7397,Lysa,Sansa,"Look down,Look down."
7398,Marillion,Sansa,Dont!
7399,Marillion,Sansa,"Youre scaring me! Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey.Do you still want my leave to go?Do you?No."
7400,Marillion,Sansa,Not this way.
7401,Marillion,Sansa,"The lady lay a-kissing, upon a mound of  hay,"
7402,Marillion,Sansa,"Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey."
7403,Lysa,Sansa,My hair!
7404,Lysa,Sansa,Let go of my hair!
7405,Marillion,Petyr,Lysa!Whats the meaning of this?
7406,Marillion,Petyr,"Get back from there!Lysa, what are you doing?"
7407,Lysa,Petyr,Alayne.What is the trouble here?Her.
7408,Lysa,Sansa,"Shes the trouble.She kissed you.Tell her, Tell her we were just building a castle ."
7409,Lysa,Sansa,Be quiet!
7410,Lysa,Sansa,"I never gave you leave to speak.No one cares about your castle.Shes a child, Lysa."
7411,Lysa,Sansa,What did you think you were doing?I was going to marry her to Robert!
7412,Lysa,Sansa,"I was teaching her a lesson, that was all.I see."
7413,Lysa,Sansa,"I think she understands now.Isnt that so, Alayne? Yes,I understand.III dont want her here."
7414,Lysa,Sansa,"Why did you bring her to the Vale,  Petyr?"
7415,Lysa,Sansa,"She doesnt belong here.Well send her away, then.Back to Kings Landing, if you like."
7416,Lysa,Sansa,"Let her  up, now.Let her away from the door.NO!"
7417,Lysa,Sansa,You cant want her.
7418,Lysa,Sansa,"Ive proved it, havent I?"
7419,Petyr,Sansa,I gave you my maidens gift.
7420,Lysa,Petyr,". Thats past and done, Lysa.Lord Hosters dead, and his old maester as well."
7421,Lysa,Petyr,Have you been at the wine again?
7422,Jon,Lysa,Or Marillion?
7423,Jon,Lysa,Cat never gave you anything.
7424,Jon,Sansa,You promised me you would never forget  that.Nor have .
7425,Catelyn,Sansa,.I wont!
7426,Catelyn,Jon,"It was me, it was always  meeee!I know, love."
7427,Jon,Robert,"And I am here.All you need to do is take my hand, come on."
7428,Jon,Robert,"Theres no cause for all these tears.Tears, tears, tears,No need for tears ... but thats not what you said in Kings  Landing."
7429,Lysa,Petyr,"Were together  now, were together after so long, so very long, why would you want to kiss herrrrrr?Lysa,after all the storms weve suffered, you should trust me better."
7430,Lysa,Petyr,"Oh, truly?Truly.Now unhand the girl and come give me a kiss."
7431,Lysa,Petyr,"My sweet silly jealous wife,Ive only loved one woman, I promise you."
7432,Lysa,Petyr,Only one?
7433,Lysa,Petyr,Only one?Only Cat.
7434,Marillion,Petyr,You ... you...
7435,Petyr,Sansa,Youre not hurt?
7436,Petyr,Sansa,This singers killed my lady wife.
7437,Chett,Jacelyn,"Outlaws stole my life,"
7438,Chett,Jacelyn,"You,  Merrett? "
7439,Chett,Petyr,"Stupid,Outlaws dont have tails.Bloody hell, Merrett, get hold of yourself."
7440,Lothar,Stevron,"of waiting, no doubt,"
7441,Edwyn,Walder,"Fortunately,they hate each  other even more than they hate us."
7442,Walda,Walder,"He picked her because shes fat,You think Bolton gave a  mummers fart that she was your whelp?"
7443,Lothar,Walda,Wed have had the same alliance at half the price if your little porkling put  down her spoon from time to time.
7444,Lothar,Roslin,"We must each play our part, according to our gifts,You shall have one task and one task only, Merrett, but I believe you are well suited to it.I want  you to see to it that Greatjon Umber is so bloody drunk that he can hardly stand, let alone fight."
7445,Chett,Pate,"Get off there,Youre sitting on a king.Old Tristifer dont mind my bony arse."
7446,Chett,Pate,Been a long while since  he heard any new songs.
7447,Chett,Pate,"Do you  remember me, my lord?No."
7448,Chett,Pate,Why would I?I sang at your daughters wedding.
7449,Pate,Petyr,Didnt stop him from turning niggard when it was time to pay me.
7450,Pate,Petyr,Why is it your lord father never has me play at the Twins?
7451,Pate,Petyr,"He likes it loud, I have been hearing.You bring the gold?"
7452,Chett,Petyr,I asked a question.
7453,Chett,Petyr,Wheres our gold?in my saddlebag.A hundred golden dragons.
7454,Chett,Petyr,Youll get it when I see that  Petyr - 
7455,Chett,Petyr,Tastes right.
7456,Chett,Petyr,Feels right too.
7457,Chett,Petyr,Thats the whole  ransom.All you asked for.
7458,Chett,Petyr,Which one of  you is Beric Dondarrion? 
7459,Chett,Petyr,"Why, that would be me,Youre a bloody liar, Jack,Its my turn to be Lord  Beric.Does that mean I have to be Thoros?"
7460,Chett,Petyr,"My lord, sad to say, Lord Beric was  needed elsewhere."
7461,Chett,Petyr,"But well sort you out just  as he would, have no fear."
7462,Chett,Petyr,"You  have your gold,Give me my nephew, and Ill be gone."
7463,Chett,Petyr,"Hes in the godswood,Well take you to him.Notch, you hold his  horse."
7464,Chett,Petyr,"My water skin,A swallow of wine, to settle my - We dont drink with your sort,Its this way.Follow me."
7465,Chett,Petyr,"You killed him,Sharp as a blade, this one,"
7466,Chett,Petyr,"I brought the  gold.That was good of you,Well see that its put to good use."
7467,Chett,Petyr,"You ... you had no  right.We had a rope,Thats right enough."
7468,Chett,Petyr,"No,I only came to ransom Petyr.   said the singer, That was a lie of sorts, as it happens."
7469,Petyr,Yellow,What are you doing?
7470,Petyr,Yellow,Youd never dare hang a Frey.
7471,Petyr,Yellow,"That other one, the pimply boy, he said the same thing."
7472,Petyr,Yellow,"My father will pay you.Im worth a good ransom, more than  Petyr, twice as much."
7473,Petyr,Yellow,"Lord Walder might be half-blind and gouty, but hes not so stupid as to snap at the  same bait twice.Next time hell send a hundred swords instead of a hundred dragons, I fear.He will!"
7474,Petyr,Yellow,"Hell send a thousand swords, and  kill you all.He has to catch us first."
7475,Petyr,Yellow,"And he cant hang us twice, now can  he?"
7476,Petyr,Thoros,"Here now, dont soil yourself.All you  need to do is answer me a question, and Ill tell them to let you go."
7477,Petyr,Thoros,"What do you want to know?Ill tell you true, I  swear it."
7478,Petyr,Thoros,"Well, as it happens, were looking for a dog that ran away.A dog?"
7479,Petyr,Thoros,What kind of dog?He answers to the name Sandor Clegane.
7480,Joffrey,Thoros,"Did you see  him at the wedding, perchance?The Red Wedding?"
7481,Joffrey,Thoros,He wasnt in the castle.
7482,Joffrey,Thoros,". He would have had a child with him,A skinny girl, about ten.Or perhaps a boy the  same age.I dont think so,Not that I knew.No?"
7483,Joffrey,Yellow,"Well, up you go.No,No, dont, I gave you your answer, you said youd let me go.Seems to me that what I said was Id tell them to let you go."
7484,Joffrey,Yellow,"Lem,  let him go.Go bugger yourself,The Day They Hanged Black Robin.Please."
7485,Aegon,Yellow,Ive done you no harm.
7486,Aegon,Yellow,"I have children.That Young Wolf never will,"
7487,Aegon,Yellow,"He shamed us, the whole realm was laughing,  we had to cleanse the stain on our honor."
7488,Aegon,Yellow,Maybe so.What do a bunch o bloody peasants know about a lords honor?
7489,Aegon,Yellow,"We know some about murder, though.Not murder."
7490,Aegon,Yellow,"It was vengeance, we had a right to our vengeance."
7491,Jared,Tytos,". So you sewed his head on Robb Starks neck after both o them were dead,My father did that."
7492,Jared,Ryman,You wouldnt kill a man for drinking.
7493,Jared,Ryman,"They say Lord Beric always gives a man a  trial, that he wont kill a man unless somethings proved against him."
7494,Jared,Ryman,"Lothar rigged the tents to  collapse and put the crossbowmen in the gallery with the musicians, Bastard Walder led the attack on the  camps ... theyre the ones you want, not me, I only drank some wine ... you have no witness.As it happens, youre wrong there."
