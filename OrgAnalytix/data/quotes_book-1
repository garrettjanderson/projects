1,Gared,Waymar,"Dead is dead,We have no business with the dead.Are they dead?"
2,Gared,Waymar,"What proof have we?Will saw them,If he says they are dead, thats proof enough for me."
3,Gared,Waymar,"My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,Never believe anything you hear at a womans tit.There are things to be learned even from the dead."
4,Gared,Waymar,"We have a long ride before us,Eight days, maybe nine.And night is falling."

11,Eddison,Mag,"The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,I got close as I dared."
12,Eddison,Waymar,"No living man ever lay so still.Did you see any blood?Well, no,Did you see any weapons?Some swords, a few bows."
13,Gared,Waymar,"It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.Did you make note of the position of the bodies?"

18,Gared,Waymar,"Some,The wind, mlord."
19,Gared,Waymar,"What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?"
20,Gared,Waymar,"It was the cold,I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy."

33,Eddison,Waymar,"Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire."
34,Eddison,Waymar,"Will, lead us there.I would see these dead men for myself."
35,Gared,Waymar,"We can make a better pace than this, surely,Not with this horse,"
36,Gared,Waymar,Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead?
37,Gared,Waymar,Why are you stopping?
38,Gared,Waymar,"Best go the rest of the way on foot, mlord.Its just over that ridge."
39,Gared,Waymar,"Theres something wrong here,"
40,Gared,Waymar,Is there?Cant you feel it?
41,Gared,Waymar,Listen to the darkness.
42,Gared,Waymar,Wind.
43,Gared,Waymar,"Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?"
44,Gared,Waymar,"The trees press close here,That sword will tangle you up, mord.Better a knife.If I need instruction, I will ask for it,Gared, stay here.Guard the horses."
45,Gared,Waymar,"We need a fire.Ill see to it.How big a fool are you, old man?If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.Theres some enemies a fire will keep away,Bears and direwolves and ... and other things ."

49,Eddison,Gared,"Lead on,"
50,Moon,Waymar,Gods!

52,Moon,Waymar,Somethings wrong.
53,Eddison,Waymar,"Your dead men seem to have moved camp, Will."
54,Eddison,Waymar,"On your feet, Will,Theres no one here.I wont have you hiding under a bush."
55,Eddison,Waymar,I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging.We will find these men.
56,Eddison,Waymar,Up the tree.
57,Eddison,Waymar,Look for a fire.
58,Bran,Eddison,Who goes there?
59,Bran,Waymar,"Will, where are you?"
60,Bran,Waymar,Can you see anything?
61,Bran,Waymar,Answer me!Why is it so cold?
62,Eddison,Waymar,"Come no farther,"
63,Eddison,Waymar,Dance with me then.
64,Eddison,Waymar,For Robert!
65,Eddard,Theon,"Ice,"
66,Bran,Jon,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die."
67,Bran,Jon,"Keep the pony well in hand,And dont look away.Father will know if you do."
68,Bran,Jon,"Ass,"
69,Bran,Jon,"You did well,"
70,Bran,Robb,"The deserter died bravely,"
71,Jon,Robb,"He had courage, at the least.No,It was not courage."
72,Jon,Robb,"You could see it in his eyes, Stark."
73,Jon,Robb,"The Others take his eyes,He died well.Race you to the bridge?Done,"
74,Bran,Robb,"Are you well, Bran?"
75,Bran,Robb,"Yes, Father,"
76,Bran,Robb,"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.What do you think?"
77,Bran,Robb,"Can a man still be brave if hes afraid?That is the only time a man can be brave,Do you understand why I did it?He was a wildling,They carry off women and sell them to the Others."
78,Bran,Robb,Old Nan has been telling you stories again.
79,Bran,Eddison,"The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it."
80,Bran,Eddison,"King Robert has a headsman,He does,As did the Targaryen kings before him."
81,Jon,Jory,"One day, Bran, you will be Robbs bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you."
82,Jon,Jory,A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.
83,Jon,Jory,"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!"
84,Bran,Jory,"Trouble, my lord?Beyond a doubt,Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now."
85,Bran,Jory,Gods!
86,Jory,Robb,"Robb, get away from it!"
87,Bran,Robb,"She cant hurt you,Shes dead, Jory."
88,Robb,Theon,What in the seven hells is it?
89,Bran,Robb,"A wolf,A freak,Look at the size of it."
90,Jon,Theon,"Its no freak,Thats a direwolf.They grow larger than the other kind.Theres not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.I see one now,"
91,Bran,Robb,"Go on,You can touch him.Here you go."
92,Bran,Jon,There are five of them.
93,Hullen,Jory,"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,I like it not.It is a sign,"
94,Hullen,Jory,"This is only a dead animal, Jory,"
95,Jory,Robb,"Do we know what killed her?Theres something in the throat,There, just under the jaw.,, His father knelt and groped under the beasts head with his hand."
96,Hullen,Jory,"Im surprised she lived long enough to whelp,"
97,Hullen,Jory,"Maybe she didnt,Ive heard tales ."
98,Hullen,Jory,"maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.Born with the dead,Worse luck.No matter,They be dead soon enough too."
99,Bran,Theon,"The sooner the better,"
100,Bran,Theon,"Give the beast here, Bran."
101,Bran,Robb,No!
102,Bran,Robb,"Its mine.Put away your sword, Greyjoy,"
103,Harwin,Hullen,"We will keep these pups.You cannot do that, boy,It be a mercy to kill them,"
104,Bran,Hullen,"Hullen speaks truly, son.Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.No!"
105,Jon,Robb,"Ser Rodriks red bitch whelped again last week,It was a small litter, only two live pups.Shell have milk enough.Shell rip them apart when they try to nurse.Lord Stark,"
106,Bran,Jon,"There are five pups,Three male, two female.What of it, Jon?You have five trueborn children,Three sons, two daughters."
107,Bran,Jon,"Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord."
108,Jon,Robb,"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?"
109,Jon,Robb,"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,I am no Stark, Father."
110,Bran,Robb,"I will nurse him myself, Father,I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.Me too!"
111,Bran,Robb,"Easy to say, and harder to do."
112,Bran,Robb,Is that understood?
113,Bran,Robb,"You must train them as well,You must train them."
114,Bran,Robb,"Are you sure you want this?Yes, Father,Yes,The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.They wont die,We wont let them die.Keep them, then."
115,Desmond,Jory,Its time we were back to Winterfell.
116,Bran,Jon,"What is it, Jon?"
117,Bran,Jon,Cant you hear it?
118,Bran,Jon,"There,"
119,Bran,Jon,"He must have crawled away from the others,Or been driven away,"
120,Jon,Theon,"An albino,This one will die even faster than the others."
121,Jon,Theon,"I think not, Greyjoy,This one belongs to me."
122,Brandon,Eddard,"The heart tree,"
123,Catelyn,Eddard,"Eddard,"
124,Catelyn,Eddard,"Catelyn,"
125,Catelyn,Eddard,Where are the children?
126,Catelyn,Eddard,"In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups."
127,Catelyn,Eddard,"Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.Is he afraid?"
128,Catelyn,Eddard,"A little,He is only three."
129,Catelyn,Eddard,He must learn to face his fears.
130,Catelyn,Eddard,"And winter is coming.Yes,"
131,Catelyn,Eddard,"The man died well, Ill give him that,"
132,Catelyn,Eddard,"I was glad for Brans sake.You would have been proud of Bran.I am always proud of Bran,"
133,Catelyn,Eddard,"He was the fourth this year,The poor man was half-mad.Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him."
134,Catelyn,Eddard,Ben writes that the strength of the Nights Watch is down below a thousand.
135,Catelyn,Eddard,They are losing men on rangings as well.Is it the wildlings?
136,Catelyn,Eddard,Who else?
137,Catelyn,Eddard,And it will only grow worse.The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this Kingbeyond-the-Wall for good and all.Beyond the Wall?
138,Catelyn,Eddard,Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.There are darker things beyond the Wall.
139,Catelyn,Luwin,You listen to too many of Old Nans stories.
140,Catelyn,Luwin,"No living man has ever seen one.Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,"
141,Catelyn,Luwin,You did not come here to tell me crib tales.
142,Catelyn,Luwin,"What is it, my lady?"
143,Catelyn,Eddard,"There was grievous news today, my lord.I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself."
144,Catelyn,Eddard,"I am   so sorry, my love.Jon Arryn is dead."
145,Eddard,Hoster,Jon .
146,Eddard,Hoster,.
147,Eddard,Hoster,"Is this news certain?It was the kings seal, and the letter is in Roberts own hand."
148,Catelyn,Hoster,"Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.That is some small mercy, I suppose,"
149,Catelyn,Jon,"Your sister,And Jons boy.What word of them?The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead."
150,Catelyn,Jon,"She needs the comfort of family and friends around her.Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not?Jon named him Knight of the Gate, Id heard."
151,Catelyn,Eddard,"Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy."
152,Catelyn,Eddard,".Go to her,Take the children."
153,Catelyn,Eddard,"That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.Would that I could,The letter had other tidings.The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out."
154,Catelyn,Eddard,Robert is coming here?
155,Catelyn,Eddard,"I knew that would please you,We should send word to your brother on the Wall.Yes, of course,Ben will want to be here.I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird."
156,Catelyn,Eddard,"Damnation, how many years has it been?"
157,Catelyn,Eddard,"How many in his party, did the message say?I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders.Cersei and the children travel with them.Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,It is just as well.That will give us more time to prepare.The queens brothers are also in the party,"
158,Catelyn,Robert,"Well, if the price for Roberts company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it.It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.Where the king goes, the realm follows,It will be good to see the children."
159,Eddard,Jory,"He must be, what, five by now?Prince Tornmen is seven,The same age as Bran."
160,Eddard,Jory,"The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year."
161,Eddard,Jory,"There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt."
162,Eddard,Jory,Damn his royal hide.
163,Daenerys,Viserys,This is beauty.
164,Daenerys,Viserys,Caress the fabric.
165,Illyrio,Viserys,"Is it really mine?A gift from the Magister Illyrio,"
166,Illyrio,Viserys,The color will bring out the violet in your eyes.
167,Daenerys,Illyrio,Tonight you must look like a princess.
168,Daenerys,Illyrio,Why does he give us so much?
169,Daenerys,Illyrio,What does he want from us?
170,Daenerys,Viserys,"Illyrio is no fool,"
171,Daenerys,Mag,The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.
172,Daenerys,Viserys,waking the dragon.
173,Daenerys,Viserys,Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you.
174,Daenerys,Viserys,"Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount."
175,Daenerys,Viserys,You still slouch. He pushed back her shoulders with his hands.
176,Daenerys,Viserys,You will not fail me tonight.
177,Daenerys,Viserys,"You dont want to wake the dragon, do you?"
178,Daenerys,Viserys,Do you?
179,Daenerys,Viserys,"No,"
180,Daenerys,Viserys,Good.
181,Daenerys,Eddison,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight."
182,Daenerys,Drogo,"Our land,"
183,Daenerys,Viserys,"Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever."
184,Daenerys,Viserys,The dragon remembers.
185,Daenerys,Willem,"Little PrincessMy Lady,"
186,Daenerys,Viserys,the beggar king.
187,Daenerys,Viserys,"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,"
188,Daenerys,Viserys,"The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and Kings Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back."
189,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Come,"
190,Daenerys,Viserys,"Ours is the house of the dragon,The fire is in our blood."
191,Daenerys,Viserys,"Drogo is so rich that even his slaves   wear golden collars.A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver."
192,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Now you look all a princess,"
193,Illyrio,Mag,"Stand there,Turn around."
194,Illyrio,Mag,".Regal,"
195,Illyrio,Viserys,"May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,"
196,Illyrio,Viserys,"She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,Drogo will be enraptured.Shes too skinny,"
197,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?She has had her blood. Illyrio told him, not for the first time."
198,Daenerys,Illyrio,"and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo."
199,Daenerys,Illyrio,"I suppose,The savages have queer tastes."
200,Daenerys,Illyrio,".Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,"
201,Daenerys,Illyrio,Do you take me for a fool?
202,Daenerys,Illyrio,I take you for a king.
203,Daenerys,Illyrio,My apologies if I have given offense.
204,Daenerys,Viserys,"We wont need his whole khalasar, "
205,Daenerys,Viserys,"Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers."
206,Illyrio,Mag,They cry out for their king.
207,Illyrio,Mag,"They do, dont they?They are your people, and they love you well,In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water."
208,Daenerys,Illyrio,Or so my agents tell me.
209,Illyrio,Mag,"I shall kill the Usurper myself,as he killed my brother Rhaegar."
210,Drogo,Illyrio,"It is not that we fear these barbarians,The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests promise ."
211,Drogo,Illyrio,"yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?"
212,Mag,Viserys,"Insolent eunuch,"
213,Illyrio,Mag,Many important men will be at the feast tonight.
214,Illyrio,Viserys,"No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.Oh, yes,He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that."
215,Daenerys,Viserys,"I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live."
216,Daenerys,Moon,"Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,"
217,Daenerys,Moon,"His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos."
218,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Those three are Drogos bloodriders, there,By the pillar is Khal Moro, with his son Rhogoro.The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont."
219,Daenerys,Illyrio,A knight?No less.
220,Daenerys,Illyrio,Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.What is he doing here?
221,Daenerys,Illyrio,"The Usurper wanted his head,Some trifling affront."
222,Daenerys,Illyrio,"A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,"
223,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Over there, sweet princess,there is the khal himself."
224,Illyrio,Mag,"I must go and make my submissions,Wait here.I shall bring him to you."
225,Drogo,Illyrio,"Do you see his braid, sweet sister?"
226,Drogo,Viserys,You see how long it is?
227,Drogo,Viserys,"When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their shame."
228,Daenerys,Drogo,"He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen."
229,Daenerys,Drogo,"I dont want to be his queen,Please, please, Viserys, I dont want to, I want to go home.Home?"
230,Daenerys,Illyrio,"How are we to go home, sweet sister?They took our home from us!"
231,Daenerys,Illyrio,How are we to go home?
232,Daenerys,Drogo,"I dont know she said at last, her voice breaking."
233,Daenerys,Drogo,"I do,We go home with an army, sweet sister."
234,Daenerys,Drogo,"And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will."
235,Daenerys,Drogo,"Id let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army."
236,Daenerys,Mag,"Illyrio is bringing him over, and he will not see you crying."
237,Drogo,Viserys,"Smile,And stand up straight."
238,Daenerys,Viserys,"Gods know, you have little enough as is."
239,Eddard,Tyrion,"Eddard!Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours."
240,Eddard,Tyrion,You have not changed at all.
241,Catelyn,Lysa,Your Grace.
242,Jory,Petyr,"Take me down to your crypt, Eddard."
243,Eddard,Robert,"I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?"
244,Eddard,Robert,"Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck."
245,Eddard,Robert,"Where are all yourpeople?Likely they were too shy to come out,"
246,Eddard,Robert,Kings are a rare sight in the north.
247,Eddard,Robert,"More likely they were hiding under the snow.Snow, Eddard!"
248,Eddard,Robert,"Late summer snows are common enough,I hope they did not trouble you.They are usually mild.The Others take your mild snows,What will this place be like in winter?I shudder to think.The winters are hard,But the Starks will endure.We always have.You need to come south,You need a taste of summer before it flees."
249,Eddard,Robert,Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.
250,Eddard,Robert,"And the girls, Eddard!"
251,Eddard,Robert,"I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat."
252,Eddard,Robert,"Even in the streets, its too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but its all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked."
253,Eddard,Robert,"Your Grace,"
254,Eddard,Robert,"She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon."
255,Eddard,Robert,"Here,"
256,Lyanna,Robert,"She was more beautiful than that,"
257,Eddard,Lyanna,"Ah, damn it, Eddard, did you have to bury her in a place like this?"
258,Eddard,Lyanna,She deserved more than darkness .
259,Eddard,Lyanna,".She was a Stark of Winterfell,This is her place.She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.I was with her when she died,She wanted to come home, to rest beside Brandon and Father."
260,Eddard,Howland,"I bring her flowers when I can,Lyanna was ."
261,Eddard,Howland,fond of flowers.
262,Eddard,Robert,"I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.You did,Only once,"
263,Eddard,Robert,"In my dreams, I kill him every night,A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves."
264,Jaime,Tyrion,"We should return, Your Grace. Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily. Eddard replied quietly.When the king did not answer, he said, "
265,Jon,Robert,I have never seen a man sicken so quickly.
266,Eddard,Robert,It burned right through him.
267,Eddard,Robert,I loved that old man.We both did.
268,Eddard,Robert,Catelyn fears for her sister.How does Lysa bear her grief?
269,Eddard,Robert,"Not well, in truth,I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Eddard."
270,Eddard,Jon,Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?
271,Lysa,Tywin,"The wife has lost the husband,Perhaps-the mother feared to lose the son.The boy is very young.Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before."
272,Eddard,Robert,Cersei was furious.
273,Eddard,Robert,"The boy is my namesake, did you know that?"
274,Eddard,Robert,"How can I do that if his mother steals him away?I will take him as ward, if you wish,Lysa should consent to that.She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.A generous offer, my friend,"
275,Eddard,Tywin,"Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.I have more concern for my nephews welfare than I do for Lannister pride,That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister."
276,Eddard,Robert,"Ah, Eddard,you are still too serious."
277,Eddard,Robert,"I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now theres no need for it.Come, walk with me."
278,Benjen,Eddard,"You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long."
279,Benjen,Eddard,"For the joy of my company, surely,And there is the Wall."
280,Benjen,Robert,  Robert said.
281,Eddard,Robert,He will not be easy to replace.His son .
282,Eddard,Robert,.
283,Eddard,Robert,"His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,No more."
284,Eddard,Robert,"The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East.The title goes with the domain.Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,I have this year to think of, and next.A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Eddard.In peace, the title is only an honor."
285,Eddard,Robert,"Surely you owe, Jon that much for his service."
286,Eddard,Robert,Jons service was the duty he owed his liege lord.
287,Eddard,Robert,A mere boy cannot hold the east.
288,Eddard,Robert,"Enough of this.There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you."
289,Eddard,Robert,"I have need of you, Eddard.I am yours to command, Your Grace.Always."
290,Eddard,Robert,Those years we spent in the Eyrie .
291,Eddard,Robert,"I want you down in Kings Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody."
292,Eddard,Robert,"I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one."
293,Eddard,Robert,"I understand,"
294,Eddard,Robert,"I think you do.If so, you are the only one, my old friend."
295,Eddard,Robert,"Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King."
296,Eddard,Robert,"Your Grace,I am not worthy of the honor."
297,Eddard,Robert,"If I wanted to honor you, Id let you retire.I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave."
298,Eddard,Robert,"You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?"
299,Eddard,Robert,"What the king dreams,the Hand builds.I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it.The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit."
300,Eddard,Lyanna,"Damn it, Eddard,You might at least humor me with a smile.They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a mans laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.Come south with me, and Ill teach you how to laugh again,You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it."
301,Eddard,Robert,"My Joffrey and your Sansa shall join our houses, as   Lyanna and I might once have done."
302,Eddard,Robert,Sansa is only eleven.
303,Eddard,Robert,Old enough for betrothal.The marriage can wait a few years.
304,Eddard,Robert,"Now stand up and say yes, curse you.Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,"
305,Eddard,Robert,These honors are all so unexpected.
306,Eddard,Robert,".Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must."
307,Eddard,Robert,Just dont keep me waiting too long.I am not the most patient of men.
308,Jon,Tyrion,Kingslayer
309,Jon,Theon,Hungry again?
310,Benjen,Jon,Is this one of the direwolves Ive heard so much of?
311,Benjen,Jon,"Yes,His name is Ghost."
312,Benjen,Jon,"Summerwine,Nothing so sweet.How many cups have you had, Jon?"
313,Benjen,Jon,As I feared.
314,Benjen,Jon,I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.
315,Benjen,Jon,"A very quiet wolf,Hes not like the others,He never makes a sound."
316,Benjen,Jon,"The others are all dark, grey or black.There are still direwolves beyond the Wall.We hear them on our rangings."
317,Benjen,Jon,"Dont you usually eat at table with your brothers?Most times,But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.I see."
318,Benjen,Jon,My brother does not seem very festive tonight.
319,Benjen,Jon,"The queen is angry too,Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon.The queen didnt want him to go."
320,Benjen,Jon,"You dont miss much, do you, Jon?We could use a man like you on the Wall."
321,Benjen,Jon,"Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but Im the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.Notable achievements.Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will."
322,Benjen,Jon,"The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.I am almost a man grown,I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.Thats true enough,"
323,Benjen,Jon,"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,"
324,Benjen,Jon,"A conquest that lasted a summer,Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it.Someone should have told him that war isnt a game."
325,Jon,Robb,"Also,Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died."
326,Jon,Robb,"I want to serve in the Nights Watch, Uncle."
327,Jon,Sansa,"You dont know what youre asking, Jon."
328,Benjen,Jon,"Our mistress is honor.A bastard can have honor too,I am ready to swear your oath.You are a boy of fourteen,Not a man, not yet.Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.I dont care about that!"
329,Benjen,Jon,"You might, if you knew what it meant,If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son."
330,Benjen,Jon,Im not your son!
331,Benjen,Jon,Mores the pity.
332,Benjen,Jon,"Come back to me after youve fathered a few bastards of your own, and well see how you feel."
333,Benjen,Jon,"I will never father a bastard,Never!"
334,Benjen,Jon,"I must be excused,"
335,Jon,Tyrion,"Boy,"
336,Jon,Tyrion,"Is that animal a wolf?A direwolf,His name is Ghost."
337,Jon,Tyrion,"What are you doing up there?Why arent you at the feast?Too hot, too noisy, and Id drunk too much wine,I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother.Might I have a closer look at your wolf?"
338,Jon,Tyrion,"Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?Oh, bleed that,"
339,Jon,Tyrion,"I believe Ive frightened your wolf.My apologies.Hes not scared,"
340,Jon,Tyrion,"Ghost, come here."
341,Jon,Tyrion,Thats it.
342,Jon,Tyrion,"Shy, isnt he?"
343,Jon,Tyrion,"Sit, Ghost,Thats it.Keep still."
344,Jon,Tyrion,You can touch him now.
345,Jon,Tyrion,"Ive been training him.I see,Nice wolf.If I wasnt here, hed tear out your throat,"
346,Jon,Tyrion,"In that case, you had best stay close,"
347,Jon,Tyrion,"I am Tyrion Lannister.I know,"
348,Eddison,Jon,"Youre Eddard Starks bastard, arent you?"
349,Eddison,Jon,Did I offend you?
350,Eddison,Jon,Sorry.
351,Eddison,Jon,Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.
352,Eddison,Jon,"You are the bastard, though.Lord Eddard Stark is my father,"
353,Eddison,Jon,"Yes,I can see it.You have more of the north in you than your brothers.Half brothers,"
354,Jon,Tyrion,"Let me give you some counsel, bastard,Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not."
355,Jon,Tyrion,"Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you."
356,Jon,Tyrion,"What do you know about being a bastard?All dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes.You are your mothers trueborn son of Lannister.Am IDo tell my lord father.MY mother died birthing me, and hes never   been sure.I dont even know who my mother was,Some woman, no doubt.Most of them are."
357,Jon,Tyrion,"Remember this, boy.All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs."
358,Eddard,Rickon,"I will refuse him,"
359,Catelyn,Eddard,You cannot.You must not.My duties are here in the north.I have no wish to be Roberts Hand.He will not understand that.
360,Catelyn,Eddard,Cant you see the danger that would put us in?
361,Catelyn,Eddard,Robert would never harm me or any of mine.
362,Catelyn,Eddard,"I know the man!You knew the man,The king is a stranger to you."
363,Eddard,Sansa,"Pride is everything to a king, my lord.Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.Honors?"
364,Eddard,Sansa,"In his eyes, yes,And in yours?And in mine,"
365,Eddard,Sansa,"He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that?"
366,Eddard,Joffrey,"What is so wrong with that?Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,And Joffrey ."
367,Eddard,Joffrey,.
368,Brandon,Eddard,And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.
369,Bran,Brandon,Brandon.
370,Brandon,Eddard,"I never asked for this cup to pass to me.Perhaps not,but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or not."
371,Desmond,Eddard,What is it?
372,Desmond,Eddard,"My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience.You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?Yes, my lord.He insists.Very well.Send him in."
373,Eddard,Luwin,"Perhaps we should close the windows,"
374,Eddard,Luwin,"My lord,pardon for disturbing your rest."
375,Eddard,Luwin,Been left?
376,Catelyn,Eddard,"I was not told.There was no rider, my lord."
377,Catelyn,Eddard,"We have had no other visitors from the south.A wooden box, you say?"
378,Catelyn,Eddard,"Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it.The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal."
379,Catelyn,Luwin,"A lens,What has that to do with me?I asked the same question,Clearly there was more to this than the seeming."
380,Catelyn,Luwin,A lens is an instrument to help us see.Indeed it is.
381,Catelyn,Luwin,What is it that they would have us see more clearly?The very thing I asked myself.
382,Eddard,Luwin,"I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes."
383,Eddard,Luwin,"Let me have it, then."
384,Eddard,Luwin,"Pardons, my lord."
385,Catelyn,Luwin,May I approach?
386,Eddard,Luwin,"Stay,"
387,Catelyn,Eddard,"What is it?My lady, youre shaking.Im afraid,"
388,Catelyn,Eddard,Its from Lysa.
389,Catelyn,Eddard,"It will not make us glad,There is grief in this message, Eddard.I can feel it."
390,Catelyn,Eddard,Open it.
391,Catelyn,Luwin,Lysa took no chances.  Catelyn admitted. Maester Luwin said. Catelyn said.
392,Catelyn,Eddard,What are you doing?
393,Catelyn,Eddard,"Lighting a fire,"
394,Catelyn,Eddard,"Maester Luwin-Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,This is no time for false modesty."
395,Catelyn,Eddard,"My lady, tell me!What was this message?"
396,Catelyn,Eddard,"A warning,If we have the wits to hear."
397,Catelyn,Eddard,Go on.Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.
398,Catelyn,Eddard,"By whom?The Lannisters,The queen."
399,Catelyn,Eddard,"Gods,"
400,Catelyn,Eddard,"Your sister is sick with grief.She cannot know what she is saying.She knows,Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden."
401,Catelyn,Robert,"To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion."
402,Catelyn,Robert,Now we truly have no choice.
403,Eddard,Robert,You must go south with him and learn the truth.
404,Eddard,Luwin,The only truths I know are here.The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.
405,Eddard,Luwin,"The Hand of the King has great power, my lord."
406,Catelyn,Eddard,"Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true."
407,Catelyn,Eddard,"You say you love Robert like a brother.Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?The Others take both of you,"
408,Eddard,Luwin,"My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king.He never came home again.A different time,A different king.Yes,"
409,Eddard,Luwin,"Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell."
410,Eddard,Luwin,"No,"
411,Eddard,Robb,"Yes,You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Roberts errands."
412,Luwin,Robb,"He must be ready when his time comes.Gods will, not for many years,Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood."
413,Catelyn,Luwin,Winter is coming.
414,Catelyn,Eddard,What of the other children?
415,Catelyn,Eddard,"Rickon is very young,He should stay here with you and Robb.The others I would take with me.I could not bear it,You must,Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion."
416,Catelyn,Sansa,In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.
417,Bran,Eddard,"Yes,but please, Eddard, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. Eddard said."
418,Catelyn,Robert,Our House will be the safer for it.
419,Eddard,Rickon,"Keep him off the walls, then,You know how Bran loves to climb."
420,Catelyn,Luwin,"Thank you, my lady,This is hard, I know.What of Jon Snow, my lord?"
421,Catelyn,Eddard,son
422,Asha,Eddard,"Never ask me about Jon,He is my blood, and that is all you need to know.And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady."
423,Catelyn,Eddard,"Jon must go,He and Robb are close,I had hoped ."
424,Catelyn,Eddard,".He cannot stay here,He is your son, not mine.I will not have him."
425,Catelyn,Eddard,You know I cannot take him south.
426,Catelyn,Eddard,He will be shunned.
427,Catelyn,Eddard,They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.And none of them has ever been seen at court!
428,Catelyn,Eddard,The Lann.ister woman has seen to that.
429,Randyll,Samwell,
430,Eddard,Luwin,"Another solution presents itself,Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago.It seems the boy aspires to take the black."
431,Catelyn,Eddard,He asked to join the Nights Watch?
432,Eddard,Luwin,"There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.And even a bastard may rise high in the Nights Watch,"
433,Eddard,Luwin,Jon is so young.
434,Catelyn,Luwin,".A hard sacrifice,Yet these are hard times, my lord."
435,Eddard,Luwin,"Very well,I suppose it is for the best.I will speak to Ben.When shall we tell Jon?"
436,Jon,Luwin,When I must.
437,Jon,Luwin,"When the   time comes, I will tell him myself."
438,Mordane,Sansa,"Sansas work is as pretty as she is,She has such fine, delicate hands."
439,Arya,Catelyn,Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.
440,Arya,Jeyne,What are you talking about?
441,Arya,Jeyne,"Tell me,"
442,Arya,Sansa,"We were talking about the prince,"
443,Arya,Jeyne,"Joffrey likes your sister,"
444,Beth,Sansa,"He told her she was very beautiful.Hes going to marry her,Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm."
445,Arya,Sansa,"Beth, you shouldnt make up stories,"
446,Arya,Sansa,"What did you think of Prince Joffrey, sister?Hes very gallant, dont you think?Jon says he looks like a girl,"
447,Arya,Sansa,"Poor Jon,He gets jealous because hes a bastard.Hes our brother,"
448,Mordane,Sansa,"What are you talking about, children?Our half brother,"
449,Mordane,Sansa,"Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,"
450,Mordane,Myrcella,Indeed.A great honor for us all.
451,Mordane,Myrcella,"Arya, why arent you at work?"
452,Arya,Sansa,Let me see your stitches.
453,Arya,Sansa,"Here,"
454,Jeyne,Sansa,"Arya, Arya, Arya,This will not do.This will not do at all."
455,Arya,Mordane,"Arya, come back here!"
456,Arya,Mordane,Youll shame us all!
457,Mordane,Myrcella,"By your leave, my lady."
458,Arya,Mordane,"Just where do you think you are going, Arya?"
459,Arya,Mordane,"I have to go shoe a horse,"
460,Arya,Sansa,Lady.
461,Joffrey,Robb,"Come,"
462,Arya,Jon,"Shouldnt you be working on your stitches, little sister?"
463,Arya,Jon,I wanted to see them fight.
464,Arya,Jon,"Come here, then."
465,Arya,Jon,"A shade more exhausting than needlework,A shade more fun than needlework,"
466,Arya,Jon,Why arent you down in the yard?
467,Arya,Jon,"Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.Oh."
468,Jon,Tommen,"I could do just as good as Bran,Hes only seven.Im nine."
469,Jon,Tommen,"Youre too skinny,"
470,Arya,Jon,"I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one."
471,Jon,Tommen,You see Prince Joffrey?
472,Arya,Jon,"Look at the arms on his surcoat,"
473,Arya,Jon,"The Lannisters are proud,Youd think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no.He makes his mothers House equal in honor to the kings.The woman is important too!"
474,Arya,Jon,"Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister.Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.A wolf with a fish in its mouth?"
475,Arya,Jon,"That would look silly.Besides, if a girl cant fight, why should she have a coat of arms?"
476,Arya,Jon,Girls get the arms but not the swords.
477,Jon,Tommen,"I did not make the rules, little sister."
478,Robb,Rodrik,Enough!
479,Robb,Rodrik,"Well fought.Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor."
480,Joffrey,Robb,"Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?"
481,Joffrey,Rodrik,Gladly.
482,Rodrik,Theon,"This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik."
483,Joffrey,Theon,"You are children,Robb may be a child,I am a prince.And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.You got more swats than you gave, Joffrey,Are you afraid?"
484,Joffrey,Robb,"Oh, terrified,Youre so much older."
485,Arya,Rodrik,"Joffrey is truly a little shit,"
486,Robb,Rodrik,What are you suggesting?
487,Robb,Rodrik,"Live steel.Done,Youll be sorry!"
488,Joffrey,Robb,"Live steel is too dangerous.I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges."
489,Arya,Rodrik,"This is your prince.Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.Are you training women here?"
490,Robb,Rodrik,"I am training knights,They will have steel when they are ready.When they are of an age."
491,Arya,Robb,"How old are you, boy?Fourteen,I killed a man at twelve.You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword."
492,Joffrey,Rodrik,"Let me do it.I can beat him.Beat him with a tourney blade, then,"
493,Joffrey,Rodrik,"Come and see me when youre older, Stark.If youre not too old."
494,Joffrey,Robb,"Come, Tommen,The hour of play is done.Leave the children to their frolics."
495,Jon,Mordane,"The show is done,"
496,Arya,Mordane,"You had best run back to your room, little sister."
497,Arya,Jon,"When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers."
498,Arya,Jon,I hate needlework!
499,Arya,Jon,"Its not fair!Nothing is fair,"
500,Hodor,Mikken,"Hodor,"
501,Bran,Eddison,"You stay here,Lie down."
502,Tyrion,Tywin,
503,Bran,Eddison,"Quiet,Sit down."
504,Bran,Eddison,Youre worse than Mother.
505,Bran,Nan,"Youre not my son,"
506,Bran,Nan,"If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you."
507,Tyrion,Tywin,Im not made of clay.
508,Bran,Stannis,"I do not like it,"
509,Bran,Stannis,"You should be the Hand.Gods forbid,Its not an honor Id want.Theres far too much work involved."
510,Renly,Stannis,Dont you see the danger this puts us in?
511,Renly,Stannis,Robert loves the man like a brother.Robert can barely stomach his brothers.
512,Renly,Stannis,Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion.Dont play the fool.
513,Bran,Robert,"I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refuse him.We ought to count ourselves fortunate,The king might as easily have named one of his brothers, or even Petyr, gods help us.Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and Ill sleep more easily by night."
514,Bran,Robert,"We will have to watch him carefully,I would sooner watch you,"
515,Bran,Robert,"Come back here.Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck,Never."
516,Bran,Robert,Why else would he leave the seat of his power?A hundred reasons.
517,Bran,Robert,Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.His wife is Lady Arryns sister.Its a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.
518,Bran,Eddison,"You fret too much.Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.That frightened cow shared Jon Arryns bed.If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled Kings Landing.When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock?"
519,Bran,Eddison,She may grow bolder now that hes safe atop the Eyrie.Mothers.
520,Bran,Robert,I think birthing does something to your minds.You are all mad.
521,Bran,Robert,"Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes.Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof."
522,Bran,Robert,Or   does she?Do you think the king will require proof?
523,Bran,Robert,"I tell you, he loves me not.And whose fault is that, sweet sister?"
524,Joffrey,Robert,"You are as blind as Robert,If you mean I see the same thing, yes,I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king.He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?"
525,Joffrey,Robert,"Oh, I dont deny hes loyal to Robert, thats obvious."
526,Bran,Joffrey,How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?
527,Bran,Joffrey,You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.Stop that!
528,Bran,Eddison,"All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,Come here and be quiet."
529,Bran,Eddison,"Stop it,"
530,Bran,Eddison,.
531,Bran,Eddison,"He saw us,So he did,"
532,Bran,Eddison,"Take my hand,Before you fall."
533,Bran,Eddison,What are you doing?
534,Bran,Eddison,"How old are you, boy?Seven,"
535,Bran,Eddison,"The things I do for love,"
536,Eddison,Tyrion,"Chayle,"
537,Eddison,Tyrion,Im off to break my fast.
538,Eddison,Tyrion,"Ayrmidons Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy Ive ever seen."
539,Sandor,Tyrion,The boy is a long time dying.I wish he would be quicker about it.
540,Joffrey,Tyrion,"At least he dies quietly,Its the wolf that makes the noise.I could scarce sleep last night."
541,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I could silence the creature, if it please you,"
542,Joffrey,Tyrion,Send a dog to kill a dog!
543,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Winterfell is so infested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one."
544,Joffrey,Tyrion,"I beg to differ, nephew,The Starks can count past six.Unlike some princes I might name."
545,Joffrey,Sandor,"A voice from nowhere,"
546,Sandor,Tyrion,Spirits of the air!
547,Joffrey,Tyrion,Down here.
548,Joffrey,Tyrion,"The little lord Tyrion,My pardons.I did not see you standing there.I am in no mood for your insolence today."
549,Joffrey,Tyrion,"Joffrey, it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort."
550,Joffrey,Tyrion,"What good will my comfort do them?None,Yet it is expected of you.Your absence has been noted.The Stark boy is nothing to me,I cannot abide the wailing of women."
551,Joffrey,Tyrion,"One word,and I will hit you again.Im going to tell Mother!"
552,Joffrey,Tyrion,"You tell your mother,But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with them."
553,Joffrey,Tyrion,Do you?
554,Sandor,Tyrion,"The prince will remember that, little lord,"
555,Sandor,Tyrion,"I pray he does,If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him."
556,Sandor,Tyrion,"Do you know where I might find my brother?Breaking fast with the queen.Ah,"
557,Cersei,Tyrion,Is Robert still abed?
558,Jaime,Tyrion,"The king has not slept at all,He is with Lord Eddard.He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart.He has a large heart, our Robert,"
559,Jaime,Tyrion,"Bread,"
560,Jaime,Tyrion,Burn it until it turns black.
561,Tommen,Tyrion,"Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?I stopped by the sickroom last night,There was no change.The maester thought that a hopeful sign.I dont want Brandon to die,"
562,Jaime,Tyrion,"Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen.It seems to be an unlucky name.Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,"
563,Cersei,Tyrion,What do you mean?
564,Myrcella,Tyrion,"Why, only that Tommen may get his wish.The maester thinks the boy may yet live."
565,Jaime,Tyrion,That is no mercy.These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain.What were the maesters words?
566,Daenerys,Drogo,"He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already."
567,Myrcella,Tyrion,"His back is broken, little one,The fall shattered his legs as well."
568,Cersei,Tyrion,"Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.If he wakes,Is that likely?The gods alone know,The maester only hopes."
569,Cersei,Tyrion,I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive.
570,Bran,Jaime,"When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger."
571,Bran,Jaime,"There is something unnatural about those animals,They are dangerous.I will not have any of them coming south with us.Youll have a hard time stopping them, sister."
572,Cersei,Tyrion,"Are you leaving soon, then?Not near soon enough,"
573,Cersei,Tyrion,Are we leaving?
574,Jaime,Tyrion,"What about you?Gods, dont tell me you are staying here?"
575,Jaime,Tyrion,Benjen Stark is returning to the Nights Watch with his brothers bastard.I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.
576,Jaime,Tyrion,"I hope youre not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother."
577,Jaime,Tyrion,"What, me, celibate?"
578,Cersei,Tyrion,"No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world."
579,Cersei,Jaime,"The children dont need to hear this filth.Tommen, Myrcella, come."
580,Jaime,Tyrion,"Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.He will if Robert commands it,And Robert will command it.There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.He could end his torment,I would, if it were my son.It would be a mercy.I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,He would not take it kindly.Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple."
581,Jaime,Tyrion,Give me a good clean death.
582,Jaime,Tyrion,"Speaking for the grotesques,I beg to differ."
583,Jaime,Tyrion,"You are a perverse little imp, arent you?Oh, yes,I hope the boy does wake.I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say."
584,Jaime,Tyrion,"Tyrion, my sweet brother,there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on."
585,Jaime,Tyrion,"Why, Jaime, my sweet brother,you wound me."
586,Bran,Jon,What areyou doing here?
587,Bran,Jon,"I came to see Bran,To say good-bye."
588,Bran,Jon,Youve said it.Now go away.
589,Bran,Catelyn,"Please,"
590,Bran,Catelyn,"I told you to leave,We dont want you here."
591,Catelyn,Jon,"Hes my brother,Shall I call the guards?Call them,You cant stop me from seeing him."
592,Jon,Robb,"Bran,Im sorry I didnt come before."
593,Jon,Robb,"Dont die, Bran."
594,Jon,Robb,.
595,Bran,Jon,"I have to go now,Uncle Benjen is waiting."
596,Bran,Jon,"We have to leave today, before the snows come."
597,Bran,Jon,"I wanted him to stay here with me,"
598,Eddard,Jon,"I prayed for it,He was my special boy."
599,Eddard,Jon,Sometimes prayers are answered.
600,Eddard,Jon,"It wasnt your fault,"
601,Bran,Jon,"I need none of your absolution, bastard."
602,Bran,Jon,"Good-bye,"
603,Bran,Jon,"Jon,"
604,Bran,Jon,Yes?
605,Bran,Jon,"It should have been you,"
606,Bran,Jon,"Uncle Benjen is looking for you,He wanted to be gone an hour ago.I know,Soon."
607,Jon,Robb,"Leaving is harder than I thought.For me too,"
608,Jon,Robb,Did you see him?
609,Jon,Robb,"Hes not going to die,I know it.You Starks are hard to kill,"
610,Jon,Robb,My mother 
611,Daenerys,Drogo,
612,Jon,Robb,Good.
613,Jon,Robb,"The next time I see you, youll be all in black."
614,Jon,Robb,"It was always my color.How long do you think it will be?Soon enough,"
615,Jon,Robb,"Farewell, Snow."
616,Jon,Robb,"And you, Stark.Take care of Bran.I will."
617,Jon,Robb,"Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you,I have one more farewell to make,Then I havent seen you,"
618,Arya,Jon,"I was afraid you were gone,They wouldnt let me out to say good-bye.What did you do now?"
619,Arya,Jon,Nothing.I was all packed and everything.
620,Arya,Jon,Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over.
621,Arya,Jon,"A proper southron lady doesnt just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.Is that what you did, little sister?Well, theyre going to get all messed up anyway,Who cares how theyre folded?Septa Mordane,I dont think shed like Nymeria helping, either."
622,Arya,Jon,"Its just as well.I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully."
623,Arya,Jon,A present?You could call it that.Close the door.
624,Arya,Jon,"Nymeria, here.Guard."
625,Arya,Jon,"A sword,"
626,Arya,Jon,"This is no toy,Be careful you dont cut yourself.The edges are sharp enough to shave with.Girls dont shave,Maybe they should.Have you ever seen the septas legs?"
627,Arya,Jon,"Its so skinny.So are you,I had Mikken make this special."
628,Arya,Jon,"It wont hack a mans head off, but it can poke him full of holes if youre fast enough.I can be fast,Youll have to work at it every day."
629,Arya,Jon,"How does it feel?Do you like the balance?I think so,First lesson,Stick them with the pointy end."
630,Arya,Jon,"I know which end to use,"
631,Arya,Jon,"Septa Mordane will take it away from me.Not if she doesnt know you have it,Who will I practice with?Youll find someone,Kings Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell."
632,Arya,Jon,.
633,Arya,Jon,Sansa!
634,Arya,Jon,"I will miss you, little sister."
635,Arya,Jon,I wish you were coming with us.Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle.Who knows?
636,Arya,Jon,I better go.Ill spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.
637,Arya,Jon,"Put down the sword first,"
638,Arya,Jon,"I almost forgot,All the best swords have names.Like Ice,"
639,Arya,Jon,"Does this have a name?Oh, tell me.Cant you guess?"
640,Arya,Jon,Your very favorite thing.
641,Arya,Jon,Needle!
642,Drogo,Illyrio,"My fellow magisters; have doubled the size of the city guard,"
643,Daenerys,Jorah,"Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos,"
644,Daenerys,Viserys,"He can have her tomorrow, if he likes,"
645,Daenerys,Illyrio,So long as he pays the price.
646,Illyrio,Viserys,"I have told you, all is settled."
647,Illyrio,Viserys,"The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.Yes, but when?When the khal chooses,He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dolthrak."
648,Illyrio,Viserys,If the omens favor war.
649,Illyrio,Viserys,I piss on Dothraki omens.
650,Illyrio,Jorah,How long must I wait?
651,Illyrio,Jorah,"You have waited most of your life, great king.What is another few months, another few years?"
652,Jorah,Viserys,"I counsel you to be patient, Your Grace."
653,Jorah,Viserys,"A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him."
654,Jorah,Viserys,"Guard your tongue, Mormont, or Ill have it out."
655,Illyrio,Jorah,The dragon does not beg.
656,Daenerys,Viserys,"You woke the dragon,You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon."
657,Daenerys,Illyrio,"The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds.There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do."
658,Daenerys,Illyrio,"A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,"
659,Doreah,Jorah,"These are no common servants, sweet sister,Illyrio and I selected them personally for you.Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love."
660,Doreah,Jorah,"Shes very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that."
661,Doreah,Jorah,"It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford,"
662,Illyrio,Mag,What are they?
663,Illyrio,Mag,"Dragons eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.I shall treasure them always."
664,Drogo,Jorah,"This is a gift worthy of a great warrior,  blood of my blood, and I am but a woman.Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.bride gifts."
665,Illyrio,Mag,"A handsome gift, Khaleesi,Most lucky."
666,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.Shes beautiful,She is the pride of the khalasar, Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khaL "
667,Illyrio,Jorah,What should I do?
668,Daenerys,Jorah,Take the reins and ride.You need not go far.
669,Illyrio,Mag,Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind.
670,Daenerys,Viserys,"Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before."
671,Daenerys,Drogo,"I am the blood of the dragon,I am the blood of the dragon.I am the blood of the dragon."
672,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,"
673,Daenerys,Drogo,"You speak the Common Tongue,No,"
674,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,Is that the only word you know?"
675,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,"
676,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,No,"
677,Alyn,Daenerys,No?
678,Alyn,Daenerys,"Yes,"
679,Alyn,Eddard,"Up, Stark!"
680,Alyn,Eddard,"Up, up!We have matters of state to discuss.By all means,Come inside, Your Grace."
681,Alyn,Robert,"No, no, no,"
682,Boros,Meryn,"The camp is full of ears.Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours."
683,Eddard,Robert,"Gods,it feels good to get out and tide the way a man was meant to ride!"
684,Eddard,Robert,"That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain ."
685,Eddard,Robert,"I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, Im going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!"
686,Eddard,Robert,I will gladly light the torch for you.Good man!
687,Eddard,Robert,Ive half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going.
688,Eddard,Robert,"I do believe you mean it.I do, I do,What do you say, Eddard?Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmers daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.Would that we could,"
689,Eddard,Robert,"We are not the boys we were.You were never the boy you were,Mores the pity."
690,Eddard,Robert,"You know the one I mean, your bastards mother?Her name was Wylla,and I would sooner not speak of her.Wylla.Yes."
691,Eddard,Robert,"She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour."
692,Eddard,Robert,.
693,Eddard,Robert,Nor will .
694,Eddard,Robert,"I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.I had taken her to wife.She was carrying my child.You are too hard on yourself, Eddard."
695,Eddard,Robert,"Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed."
696,Eddard,Robert,"Well, Ill not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times youre so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil."
697,Eddard,Robert,The barrows of the First Men.
698,Eddard,Robert,"Have we ridden onto a graveyard?There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,This land is old.And cold,"
699,Robert,Varys,"Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard."
700,Eddard,Varys,Here.
701,Eddard,Lysa,"What is the source for this information?Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?Would that I might forget him,"
702,Eddard,Robert,"Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,Lord Varys makes good use of him.So the slaver has become a spy,"
703,Eddard,Robert,"I would rather he become a corpse.Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord."
704,Eddard,Robert,Shall we send her a wedding gift?
705,Eddard,Robert,"A knife, perhaps.A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
706,Daenerys,Haggo,I see no babes.
707,Eddard,Lyanna,"Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child.You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents."
708,Robert,Tywin,And how long will this one remain an innocent?
709,Robert,Tywin,"This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.Nonetheless,"
710,Robert,Tywin,.Unspeakable?
711,Robert,Tywin,What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable.
712,Eddard,Robert,How many hundreds of times?
713,Eddard,Robert,"I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will piss on their graves."
714,Eddard,Robert,"You cant get your hands on this one, can you?"
715,Eddard,Robert,"No, gods be cursed."
716,Jon,Robert,"More fool ,  listened to him.Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand."
717,Eddard,Robert,"This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde.What would Jon say to that?He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea,The barbarians have no ships.They hate and fear the open sea."
718,Eddard,Robert,Perhaps.
719,Eddard,Robert,"If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.He will not cross,And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the sea. The king groaned."
720,Eddard,Robert,Yet we still must have a Warden of the East.
721,Eddard,Robert,"Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storms End, surely."
722,Eddard,Robert,"That is,unless you have already promised the honor to another."
723,Eddard,Robert,"What if I have?Its Jaime Lannister, is it not?"
724,Eddard,Robert,"Yes,"
725,Eddard,Robert,"Kingslayer,"
726,Jaime,Robert,"An able and courageous man, no doubt,"
727,Jaime,Robert,No one man should hold both East and West.
728,Eddard,Robert,"I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon.Dont vex me about this, Eddard, the stone has been set.Your Grace, may I speak frankly?I seem unable to stop you,"
729,Eddard,Robert,"Can you trust Jaime Lannister?He is my wifes twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.As they were bound to Aerys Targaryens,Why should I mistrust him?"
730,Eddard,Robert,His sword helped win the throne I sit on.
731,Eddard,Robert,"He swore a vow to protect his kings life with his own.Then he opened that kings throat with a sword.Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!"
732,Eddard,Robert,"If Jaime hadnt done it, it would have been left for you or me.We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,"
733,Eddard,Robert,"Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?I won my crown there.How should I forget it?You took a wound from Rhaegar,So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands."
734,Aerys,Robert,I expected to find the gates closed to us.
735,Eddard,Robert,"Instead you found that our men had already taken the city.What of it?Not our men,Lannister men."
736,Eddard,Robert,And they had taken the city by treachery.
737,Eddard,Robert,"Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,"
738,Eddard,Robert,Lannister paid them back in kind.
739,Eddard,Robert,"I shall not trouble my sleep over it.You were not there,"
740,Eddard,Robert,There was no honor in that conquest.The Others take your honor!
741,Eddard,Robert,"What did any Targaryen ever know of honor?Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragons honor!You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,"
742,Eddard,Robert,That did not bring her back.
743,Eddard,Robert,The gods be damned.
744,Eddard,Jaime,"The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace ."
745,Jorah,Mirri, Eddard said.
746,Eddard,Jaime,"How he glittered!This is well known,I was still mounted."
747,Jaime,Robert,"Its not a very comfortable seat, Im afraid. "
748,Jaime,Robert,You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?
749,Eddard,Robert,"Jaime was all of seventeen, Eddard.Scarce more than a boy.Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.Perhaps he was tired,Killing kings is weary work."
750,Eddard,Robert,In more ways than one.
751,Eddard,Robert,"Well, now I know Jaimes dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten."
752,Eddard,Jon,I want to feel the wind in my hair again.
753,Benjen,Tyrion,"The wolfswood,"
754,Tyrion,Yoren,"Rapers,"
755,Benjen,Tyrion,"I warn you, Lannister, youll find no inns at the Wall,No doubt youll find some place to put me,As you might have noticed, Im small."
756,Benjen,Tyrion,"You will not like the ride, I promise you that,"
757,Jon,Tyrion,Why do you read so much?
758,Jon,Tyrion,Look at me and tell me what you see.
759,Jon,Tyrion,Is this some kind of trick?
760,Jon,Tyrion,Tyrion Lannister.
761,Jon,Tyrion,"You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow."
762,Jon,Tyrion,"You are what, twelve?Fourteen,Fourteen, and youre taller than I will ever be."
763,Robert,Tyrion,"and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge."
764,Robert,Tyrion,"Thats why I read so much, Jon Snow."
765,Robert,Tyrion,What are you reading about?
766,Robert,Tyrion,"Dragons,What good is that? the boy said with the easy certainty of youth. Tyrion replied."
767,Jon,Tyrion,"Oh, yes.Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when hes seated on a dragons back."
768,Jon,Tyrion,"I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire."
769,Jon,Tyrion,"At other times, my sister."
770,Jon,Tyrion,"Dont look at me that way, bastard."
771,Jon,Tyrion,"Youve dreamt the same kind of dreams.No,I wouldnt ."
772,Jon,Tyrion,.No?Never?
773,Jon,Tyrion,"Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you."
774,Jon,Tyrion,"Stop it,The Nights Watch is a noble calling!"
775,Jon,Tyrion,Youre too smart to believe that.
776,Jon,Tyrion,"The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since youre not allowed to breed anyway, I dont suppose that matters.Stop it!"
777,Jon,Tyrion,"Help me,"
778,Jon,Tyrion,"Dont help me, then.Ill sit right here until you leave."
779,Jon,Tyrion,Ask me nicely.
780,Jon,Tyrion,"I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,Down, Ghost,"
781,Jon,Tyrion,Why did he attack me?
782,Jon,Tyrion,Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.
783,Jon,Tyrion,"Oh, gods,I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin."
784,Jon,Tyrion,Want some?
785,Jon,Tyrion,"Its true, isnt it?"
786,Jon,Tyrion,What you said about the Nights Watch.
787,Jon,Tyrion,"If thats what it is, thats what it is."
788,Jon,Tyrion,"Thats good, bastard.Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.Most men,But not you.No,"
789,Jon,Tyrion,There are no dragons.
790,Jon,Tyrion,"Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners."
791,Benjen,Tyrion,"More pepper,"
792,Benjen,Jon,There you are.
793,Jon,Tyrion,"I thought the Others had gotten you.It was the grumkins,"
794,Bran,Catelyn,"It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady,Youll want to know how much this royal visit cost us."
795,Bran,Catelyn,"I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,I know what the visit cost us.Take the books away.My lady, the kings party had healthy appetites. She cut him off."
796,Bran,Catelyn,Poole went south to establish Lord Eddards household at Kings Landing.
797,Bran,Catelyn,"Oh, yes.I remember."
798,Jory,Luwin,"There are several appointments that require your immediate   attention, my lady. Her eyes snapped around and found him."
799,Eddard,Hullen,"Yes, my lady. "
800,Bran,Robb,Do you?
801,Catelyn,Robb,"Yes, my lady, but the appointments-Ill make the appointments,"
802,Catelyn,Robb,"I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices,"
803,Catelyn,Robb,"Good men,Well talk about them tomorrow."
804,Luwin,Robb,"Very good, my lord."
805,Luwin,Robb,"Leave us now,"
806,Catelyn,Robb,"Mother, what are you doing?"
807,Bran,Eddard,What am I doing?
808,Bran,Eddard,How can you ask that?
809,Bran,Eddard,I am taking care of Bran.Is that what you call it?
810,Bran,Eddard,"You didnt even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south.I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window."
811,Eddard,Robb,"I cant leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last."
812,Eddard,Robb,"She took her sons limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own."
813,Catelyn,Robb,"Hes not going to die, Mother.Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed.And what if Maester Luwin is wrong?What if Bran needs me and Im not here?Rickon needs you,Hes only three, he doesnt understand whats happening."
814,Catelyn,Robb,I dont know what to do with him.
815,Bran,Catelyn,"Mother, I need you too."
816,Bran,Catelyn,I cant do it all by myself.
817,Catelyn,Robb,Brans.
818,Catelyn,Robb,"Dont,Bran needs to stay warm.He needs to hear them sing,"
819,Catelyn,Robb,"Shaggydog and Grey Wind,You can tell them apart if you listen close."
820,Bran,Robb,Make them stop!
821,Bran,Robb,"I cant stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!"
822,Bran,Robb,"Dont be afraid, Mother.They would never hurt him."
823,Catelyn,Robb,"Close your eyes,Rest.Maester Luwin tells me youve hardly slept since Brans fall.I cant,Gods forgive me, Robb, I cant, what if he dies while Im asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies ."
824,Catelyn,Robb,.
825,Catelyn,Robb,"Oh, gods, close the window!If you swear to me youll sleep."
826,Catelyn,Robb,"Dogs,All the dogs are barking."
827,Bran,Catelyn,.
828,Bran,Catelyn,"Fire, "
829,Bran,Robb,"Help me,Help me with Bran."
830,Catelyn,Robb,"The library towers on fire,"
831,Bran,Robb,"Thank the gods,"
832,Bran,Robb,"Mother, stay here.Ill come back as soon as the fires out."
833,Catelyn,Robb,Fire!
834,Bran,Catelyn,"You werent sposed to be here,No one was sposed to be here."
835,Bran,Catelyn,"No,"
836,Bran,Catelyn,"Its a mercy,Hes dead already.No,No, you cant."
837,Catelyn,Eddison,"You werent sposed to be here,"
838,Bran,Catelyn,"Thank you,"
839,Bran,Catelyn,"Bring me some bread and honey,and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing."
840,Catelyn,Hallis,Who was he?
841,Catelyn,Hallis,"No one knows his name,He was no man of Winterfell, mlady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.One of the kings men, then,or one of the Lannisters. Hal said. Greyjoy said."
842,Hallis,Hodor,"Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Nights Watch, the stalls were half-empty."
843,Catelyn,Robb,.
844,Catelyn,Robb,"We found where hed been sleeping,He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw.Its good to know my sons life was not sold cheaply,"
845,Catelyn,Hallis,"Begging your grace, mlady, you saying he was out to kill your boy?"
846,Catelyn,Hallis,"Thats madness.He came for Bran,He kept muttering how I wasnt supposed to be there."
847,Catelyn,Robb,"If I hadnt been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.Why would anyone want to kill Bran?"
848,Catelyn,Robb,"Gods, hes only a little boy, helpless, sleeping ."
849,Catelyn,Robb,.
850,Catelyn,Robb,"If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things through, Robb."
851,Catelyn,Robb,Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?
852,Catelyn,Luwin,"How is my son, Maester?"
853,Catelyn,Luwin,"Unchanged, my lady."
854,Catelyn,Robb,"Do you have the answer yet?Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of something he knows."
855,Catelyn,Robb,Very good.
856,Catelyn,Robb,"We must keep Bran safe.If there was one killer, there could be others.How many guards do you want, rnlady?"
857,Catelyn,Robb,"So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,"
858,Catelyn,Robb,"Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs.No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mothers.As you say, mlord.Do it now,And let his wolf stay in the room with him,Yes,Yes."
859,Catelyn,Hallis,"Lady Stark,did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used?The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,Why do you ask?We found the knife still in the villains grasp."
860,Catelyn,Theon,Someone gave it to him.
861,Catelyn,Theon,"Robb, close the door."
862,Luwin,Theon,"What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,I want your oaths on that.If even part of what I suspect is true, Eddard and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.Lord Eddard is a second father to me,I do so swear.You have my oath,And mine, my lady,"
863,Catelyn,Rodrik,"And you, Robb?"
864,Catelyn,Rodrik,"My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King,It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell.He remained here in the castle."
865,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I do not think Bran fell from that tower,I think he was thrown."
866,Rodrik,Theon,"My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.Oh, would he?"
867,Catelyn,Theon,"I wonder.There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,The boy had always been surehanded in the past,He knew every stone in Winterfell.Gods, If this is true, he will pay for it."
868,Robb,Rodrik,Ill kill him myself!
869,Robb,Rodrik,Put that away!
870,Catelyn,Robb,"How many times must I tell you, foolish boy?"
871,Catelyn,Rodrik,I see my son is wearing steel now.I thought it was time.
872,Robb,Theon,"Past time,Winterfell may have need of all its swords soon, and they had best not be made of wood.My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt."
873,Luwin,Rodrik,All we have is conjecture.
874,Catelyn,Rodrik,"We must have proof, or forever keep silent.Your proof is in the dagger,A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed."
875,Catelyn,Robb,"Someone must go to Kings Landing.Ill go,No,Your place is here.There must always be a Stark in Winterfell."
876,Catelyn,Robb,"I must go myself.My lady,is that wise?"
877,Robb,Theon,"You cant mean to leave him.I have done everything I can for Bran,His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin.As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.You will need a strong escort, my lady,Ill send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,No,A large party attracts unwelcome attention.I would not have the Lannisters know I am coming."
878,Catelyn,Rodrik,"My lady, let me accompany you at least.The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone.I will not be taking the kingsroad,"
879,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses."
880,Catelyn,Rodrik,Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to Kings Landing well ahead of Eddard and the Lannisters.
881,Mordane,Sansa,The king sent for him.
882,Mordane,Sansa,"There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.Ive never seen an aurochs,"
883,Mordane,Sansa,"A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,Shes not a dog, shes a direwolf,Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want."
884,Mordane,Sansa,"Youre a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature youre as willful as your sister Arya."
885,Mordane,Sansa,"And where is Arya this morning?She wasnt hungry,Do remind her to dress nicely today."
886,Joffrey,Sansa,"We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best."
887,Arya,Mordane,"Ill tell her,but shell dress the way she always does."
888,Mordane,Sansa,May I be excused?You may.
889,Arya,Sansa,"You better put on something pretty,Septa Mordane said so.Were traveling in the queens wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.Im not,Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.Rubies,What rubies?"
890,Arya,Sansa,Rhaegars rubies.This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown.
891,Arya,Sansa,"You cant look for rubies, the princess is expecting us.The queen invited us both.I dont care,The wheelhouse doesnt even have windows, you cant see a thing.What could you want to see?"
892,Arya,Sansa,"Its all just fields and farms and holdfasts.It is not,If you came with us sometimes, youd see.I hate riding,All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore."
893,Arya,Sansa,"Hold still, Im not hurting you.When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion."
894,Arya,Sansa,"Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses.You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria."
895,Arya,Sansa,"Stop that, I have to do the other side, youre all muddy.Youre not supposed to leave the column,Father said so."
896,Arya,Sansa,I didnt go far.
897,Arya,Sansa,Sometimes its fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.
898,Arya,Sansa,"You have to come with me,You cant refuse the queen.Septa Mordane will expect you."
899,Arya,Sansa,"Come back here!Theres going to be lemon cakes and tea,"
900,Arya,Sansa,"Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?I dont like the queen,"
901,Arya,Sansa,She wont even let me bring Nymeria.
902,Arya,Sansa,"A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.Myrcella is a little baby."
903,Arya,Sansa,Bad wolf!
904,Arya,Sansa,"I dont care what you say, Im going out riding."
905,Arya,Sansa,"Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child,Ill go by myself then."
906,Arya,Sansa,Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you.They wont let you bring Lady either.
907,Arya,Sansa,"The council does us great honor, my good lords.Whats happening?"
908,Eddison,Sansa,"The council sent riders from Kings Landing to escort us the rest of the way,An honor guard for the king."
909,Sandor,Sansa,"The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,"
910,Sandor,Sansa,"You are shaking, girl,Do I frighten you so much?"
911,Joffrey,Sansa,"A wolf,Seven hells, thats a direwolf,Whats it doing in camp?The Starks use them for wet nurses,"
912,Joffrey,Sansa,"Joffrey, go to her."
913,Joffrey,Sansa,"Leave her alone,"
914,Joffrey,Sandor,"What is it, sweet lady?"
915,Sandor,Sansa,"The wolf is her little pet, thats all."
916,Sandor,Sansa,"And you, dog, away with you, youre scaring my betrothed."
917,Sandor,Sansa,"It was not him, my sweet prince,It was the other one."
918,Sandor,Sansa,Payne?
919,Sandor,Sansa,"Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady.He has a fearsome aspect.As well he should."
920,Mordane,Sansa,"If the wicked do not fear the Mngs Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office."
921,Mordane,Sansa,"Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,Well spoken, child,As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark."
922,Mordane,Sansa,"I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the Kingsguard."
923,Aerys,Robert,"The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,"
924,Aerys,Joffrey,"Even in the far north, the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold."
925,Joffrey,Sansa,"Barristan the Old, you mean.Dont flatter him too sweetly, child, he thinks overmuch of himself already."
926,Joffrey,Sansa,"Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then I must concede that you are truly our Hands daughter."
927,Joffrey,Sansa,Have a care how you address my betrothed.
928,Robert,Sansa,"Your helmet bears golden antlers, my lord."
929,Barristan,Robert,"By your extreme youth, you can only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storms End and councillor to the king, and so I name you."
930,Barristan,Renly,"By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name him."
931,Ilyn,Sansa,"I am sorry if I offended you, Ser Ilyn,"
932,Renly,Sansa,"Did I say something wrong, Your Grace?Why will he not speak to me?Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,"
933,Joffrey,Sansa,"Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned."
934,Joffrey,Myrcella,"Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today.It would be my pleasure, Mother,"
935,Joffrey,Sansa,"What would you like to do?Whatever youd like to do, my prince."
936,Joffrey,Sansa,"We could go riding.Oh, I love riding,"
937,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses, and my dog seems to frighten you.Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what do you say?"
938,Joffrey,Sansa,"If you like,I suppose I could tie Lady up."
939,Joffrey,Sansa,I didnt know you had a dog .
940,Joffrey,Sansa,.
941,Joffrey,Sansa,"Hes my mothers dog, in truth.She has set him to guard me, and so he does.You mean the Hound,"
942,Joffrey,Sansa,Is it safe to leave him behind?
943,Joffrey,Sansa,"Have no fear, lady."
944,Joffrey,Sansa,All I need is this.
945,Joffrey,Sansa,"I call it Lions Tooth,"
946,Joffrey,Sansa,"My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,"
947,Joffrey,Sansa,Shouldnt we be starting back?
948,Joffrey,Sansa,"Soon,The battleground is right up ahead, where the river bends."
949,Joffrey,Sansa,"He smashed in his chest, crunch, right through the armor."
950,Joffrey,Sansa,"Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys, and my father was king.Whats that sound?"
951,Joffrey,Sansa,"I dont know,"
952,Joffrey,Sansa,"Joffrey, lets go back.I want to see what it is."
953,Joffrey,Sansa,"Someones there,"
954,Joffrey,Sansa,Youre safe with me.
955,Joffrey,Sansa,"This way,"
956,Arya,Sansa,Arya?
957,Arya,Sansa,"Go away,What are you doing here?Leave us alone."
958,Arya,Sansa,Your sister?
959,Joffrey,Sansa,"And who are you, boy?"
960,Arya,Sansa,"Mycah,"
961,Arya,Sansa,"MIord.Hes the butchers boy,Hes my friend,You leave him alone.A butchers boy who wants to be a knight, is it?"
962,Joffrey,Mycah,"Pick up your sword, butchers boy,Let us see how good you are."
963,Joffrey,Mycah,"Go on, pick it up.Or do you only fight little girls?She ast me to, mlord,She ast me to."
964,Joffrey,Mycah,Are you going to pick up your sword?
965,Joffrey,Mycah,"Its only a stick, mlord.Its not no sword, its only a stick.And youre only a butchers boy, and no knight."
966,Joffrey,Mycah,"That was my ladys sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
967,Arya,Sansa,Stop it!
968,Joffrey,Sansa,"Arya, you stay out of this.I wont hurt him ."
969,Bronn,Tyrion,
970,Arya,Sansa,"No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you, youre spoiling it,"
971,Mycah,Sansa,"Stop it, dont, stop it!"
972,Arya,Joffrey,"Get it off,Get it off!"
973,Arya,Joffrey,Nymefia!
974,Daenerys,Drogo,
975,Arya,Joffrey,much.
976,Arya,Sansa,"No,dont hurt me."
977,Joffrey,Sansa,"Joffrey,Oh, look what they did, look what they did."
978,Joffrey,Sansa,Ill ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.
979,Eddard,Sansa,"Then go,And dont touch me."
980,Eddard,Vayon,"Theyve found her, my lord."
981,Eddard,Vayon,Our men or Lannisters?T his steward Vayon Poole replied.
982,Arya,Eddard,"Where is she?Tell Jory to bring her here at once.I am sorry, my lord,The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in."
983,Arya,Eddard,.Damn that woman!
984,Arya,Eddard,Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber.Her voice may be needed.
985,Eddard,Jory,"Arya,"
986,Eddard,Jory,"Im sorry,Im sorry, Im sorry.I know,"
987,Eddard,Renly,Are you hurt?No.
988,Eddard,Renly,"Hungry some.I ate some berries, but there was nothing else.Well feed you soon enough,"
989,Eddard,Renly,What is the meaning of this?
990,Eddard,Robert,Why was I not told that my daughter had been found?
991,Eddard,Robert,Why was she not brought to me at once?
992,Cersei,Robert,How dare you speak to your king in that manner!
993,Cersei,Robert,"Quiet, woman,"
994,Cersei,Eddard,"I am sorry, Eddard."
995,Arya,Eddard,It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly.And what business is that?
996,Arya,Eddard,"You know full well, Stark."
997,Arya,Eddard,"That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.Thats not true,She just bit him a little.He was hurting Mycah.Joffrey told us what happened,You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.Thats not how it was,"
998,Eddard,Joffrey,Yes it is!
999,Eddard,Joffrey,"They all attacked me, and she threw Lions Tooth in the river!"
1000,Arya,Eddard,Liar!
1001,Arya,Eddard,Shut up!
1002,Arya,Eddard,Enough!
1003,Arya,Eddard,"Now, child, you will tell me what happened."
1004,Arya,Eddard,It is a great crime to lie to a king.
1005,Arya,Eddard,"When she is done, you will have your turn.Until then, hold your tongue."
1006,Joffrey,Renly,"Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes."
1007,Joffrey,Renly,My brother is too kind.I can find the door myself.
1008,Eddard,Joffrey,"Perchance later youll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.Lions Tooth,"
1009,Arya,Eddard,"What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this?He says one thing, she says another.They were not the only ones present,Sansa, come here."
1010,Arya,Eddard,Tell us what happened.
1011,Arya,Sansa,"I dont know,I dont remember."
1012,Arya,Sansa,.You rotten!
1013,Eddard,Jory,"Liar, liar, liar, liar.Arya, stop it!"
1014,Arya,Eddard,Are you hurt?
1015,Arya,Cersei,"The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,Robert, I want her punished.Seven hells,Cersei, look at her."
1016,Eddard,Robert,No lasting harm was done.
1017,Eddard,Robert,Joffrey will carry those scars for the rest of his life.
1018,Eddard,Robert,So he will.
1019,Eddard,Robert,"I will do the same with my son.Gladly, Your Grace,"
1020,Eddard,Robert,And what of the direwolf?
1021,Arya,Eddard,What of the beast that savaged your son?
1022,Arya,Eddard,Id forgotten about the damned wolf.
1023,Jory,Robert,"We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace."
1024,Jory,Robert,No?So be it.
1025,Jory,Robert,"A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin!A costly pelt,I want no part of this, woman.You can damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold."
1026,Cersei,Robert,I had not thought you so niggardly.The king Id thought to wed would   have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.
1027,Cersei,Robert,"That would be a fine trick, without a wolf.We have a wolf,"
1028,Cersei,Eddard,"As you will.Have Ser Ilyn see to it.Robert, you cannot mean this,"
1029,Eddard,Sansa,"Enough, Eddard, I will hear no more."
1030,Arya,Sansa,"Get her a dog, shell be happier for it."
1031,Arya,Sansa,"He doesnt mean Lady, does he?"
1032,Arya,Sansa,"No,No, not Lady, Lady didnt bite anybody, shes good ."
1033,Arya,Sansa,".Lady wasnt there,You leave her alone!Stop them,"
1034,Arya,Eddard,.
1035,Eddard,Robert,"Please, Robert."
1036,Eddard,Robert,Please.
1037,Eddard,Sansa,"Damn you, Cersei,"
1038,Robert,Sansa,"Do it yourself then, Robert,At least have the courage to do it yourself."
1039,Cersei,Joffrey,Where is the direwolf?
1040,Barristan,Joffrey,"The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, Your Grace,Send for Ilyn Payne.No,Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice."
1041,Cersei,Eddard,"If it must be done, I will do it."
1042,Cersei,Sansa,"You, Stark?"
1043,Cersei,Sansa,Why would you do such a thing?
1044,Cersei,Sansa,She is of the north.She deserves better than a butcher.
1045,Eddard,Sansa,"Lady,"
1046,Irri,Jhiqui,Choose four men and have them take the body north.
1047,Eddard,Jory,"All that way,The Lannister woman shall never have this skin."
1048,Eddard,Sandor,"No sign of your daughter, Hand,but the day was not wholly wasted."
1049,Eddard,Sandor,"You rode him down,"
1050,Eddard,Sandor,He ran.
1051,Eddard,Sandor,But not very fast.
1052,Bran,Luwin,"But I never fall,"
1053,Bran,Eddison,"I cant fly,I cant, I cant How do you know?"
1054,Bran,Eddison,"Help me,"
1055,Bran,Eddison,Are you really a crow?
1056,Bran,Eddison,"Its just a dream,"
1057,Bran,Eddison,"Ill wake up when I hit the ground,"
1058,Bran,Eddison,"You have wings,"
1059,Bran,Eddison,"The things I do for love,"
1060,Bran,Eddison,What are you doing to me?
1061,Bran,Eddison,I cant fly!
1062,Bran,Eddison,",,Fm falling!"
1063,Bran,Luwin,Im afraid .
1064,Bran,Luwin,.
1065,Bran,Eddison,Why?
1066,Bran,Eddison,Can a man still be brave if hes afraid?
1067,Bran,Eddison,That is the only time a man can be brave.
1068,Bran,Eddison,Im flying!
1069,Bran,Eddison,What are you doing?
1070,Bran,Eddison,"Hes awake, hes awake, hes awake."
1071,Bran,Robb,"His name is Summer,"
1072,Bran,Catelyn,We will make Kings Landing within the hour.
1073,Bran,Catelyn,"Your oarmen have done well by us, Captain.Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude."
1074,Bran,Catelyn,"You are far too generous, Lady Stark.The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.But theyll take the silver anyway."
1075,Bran,Catelyn,As you say.
1076,Bran,Rodrik,"My good friend,"
1077,Catelyn,Rodrik,"It is so fine to see you looking better.Yes,I havent wanted to die for almost two days now."
1078,Catelyn,Rodrik,My lady.
1079,Catelyn,Rodrik,"The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,"
1080,Catelyn,Rodrik,So soon?
1081,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I will leave you to discuss your business,"
1082,Catelyn,Rodrik,I have not been the most valiant of protectors.
1083,Catelyn,Rodrik,"We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely.That is all that truly matters."
1084,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Now we must reach the kings master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one."
1085,Catelyn,Rodrik,"He may know the blade, yes ... but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk.And there are those at court who will   know you on sight."
1086,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Petyr,"
1087,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Lord Baelish once, ah His thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word."
1088,Catelyn,Rodrik,He was my fathers ward.
1089,Brandon,Petyr,I have not seen him since.
1090,Catelyn,Rodrik,"He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread.By then I knew that Eddard would marry me in his brothers place."
1091,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Petyr sits on the small council now.I knew he would rise high,He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise.I wonder what the years have done to him."
1092,Eddison,Rodrik,"My lady,"
1093,Eddison,Rodrik,I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.
1094,Eddison,Rodrik,You would be as much at risk as I would.
1095,Eddison,Rodrik,I think not.
1096,Eddison,Rodrik,"I believe I am safe enough, my lady."
1097,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Kings Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage.Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?We shall not be going to the castle.Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river."
1098,Catelyn,Rodrik,Just so.
1099,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Sixty stags, I believe it was.For the oarmen,Oh, of a certainty,Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh."
1100,Catelyn,Rodrik,"If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a nights pleasure.There are worse things to spend money on,Winter is coming.A man must make his own choices,They earned the silver.How they spend it is no concern of mine.As you say, my lady,"
1101,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I think it best if you stay away from the common room,Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching."
1102,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I will be back before nightfall, with Ser Aron,Rest now, my lady."
1103,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Open, in the name of the king.A moment,"
1104,Arya,Sansa,"No need for that, mady."
1105,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Petyr,"
1106,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Do you know who I am?No, mlady,Mlord Petyr said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not mistreated."
1107,Catelyn,Rodrik,You may wait outside while I dress.
1108,Catelyn,Petyr,"Cat,Why have I been brought here in this fashion?"
1109,Catelyn,Petyr,Leave us.
1110,Catelyn,Petyr,"You were not mistreated, I trust,I gave firm instructions."
1111,Catelyn,Petyr,Your hands .
1112,Catelyn,Petyr,.
1113,Catelyn,Petyr,"I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.Ive angered you, my lady.That was never my intent."
1114,Catelyn,Petyr,How did you know I was in the city?
1115,Catelyn,Petyr,"Lord Varys knows all,He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first."
1116,Catelyn,Petyr,How many years?
1117,Catelyn,Petyr,So it was the Kings Spider who found me.
1118,Catelyn,Petyr,You dont want to call him that.
1119,Renly,Robert,"Thankfully, Varys came to me first.Why you?"
1120,Renly,Robert,Why not me?
1121,Pycelle,Varys,"I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.Does Varys know about "
1122,Petyr,Varys,except why you are here.
1123,Petyr,Varys,"Why are you here?A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her no?"
1124,Petyr,Varys,"Oh, very good, my lady, but please dont expect me to believe that."
1125,Petyr,Varys,What were the Tully words again?
1126,Petyr,Varys,"Family, Duty, Honor, "
1127,Petyr,Varys,"Family, Duty, Honor,All of which required you to remain in Winterfell, where our Hand left you."
1128,Petyr,Varys,Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.
1129,Petyr,Varys,"Enter,"
1130,Catelyn,Varys,"Lady Stark,to see you again after so many years is such a joy."
1131,Catelyn,Varys,"Oh, your poor hands."
1132,Catelyn,Varys,"Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?"
1133,Catelyn,Varys,"I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts."
1134,Catelyn,Varys,I was grievous sad to hear about your son.
1135,Catelyn,Varys,"The gods are cruel.On that we agree, Lord Varys,"
1136,Petyr,Varys,"On more than that, I hope, sweet lady.I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.Yes,For a certainty.Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,"
1137,Petyr,Varys,"At least in Lord Varyss hearing.Good lady,There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing   powers.Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,"
1138,Petyr,Varys,Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.
1139,Catelyn,Varys,"Oh, yes."
1140,Catelyn,Varys,"I hope you forgive me, kind lady."
1141,Catelyn,Varys,I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?
1142,Petyr,Varys,What have you done to Ser Rodrik?
1143,Petyr,Varys,I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance.
1144,Petyr,Varys,"Who is Ser Rodrik?Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,I assure you, Lady Stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight."
1145,Catelyn,Varys,"Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.How could you know all that?The whisperings of little birds,I know things, sweet lady.That is the nature of my service."
1146,Catelyn,Varys,"You do have the dagger with you, yes?"
1147,Catelyn,Varys,Here.Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.
1148,Petyr,Varys,"Careful,its sharp.Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,"
1149,Catelyn,Petyr,Such sweet balance.
1150,Catelyn,Petyr,"You should have come to me.And if I had,what would you have told me?I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at Kings Landing."
1151,Jaime,Petyr,Its mine.Yours?
1152,Jaime,Petyr,"Until the tourney on Prince Joffreys name day,I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court."
1153,Jaime,Petyr,"When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer."
1154,Catelyn,Jaime,"Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.Who?"
1155,Petyr,Varys,"The Imp,Tyrion Lannister."
1156,Alliser,Grenn,Enough!
1157,Alliser,Grenn,"The bastard broke my wrist.The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand."
1158,Alliser,Jon,Its fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.
1159,Alliser,Jon,"Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make."
1160,Alliser,Jon,"That is a longsword, not an old mans cane,Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?"
1161,Alliser,Jon,"No,"
1162,Alliser,Jon,"The truth now,Im tired,"
1163,Alliser,Jon,What you are is weak.I won.No.The Aurochs lost.
1164,Alliser,Jon,"That will be all,I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day.If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder."
1165,Benjen,Jon,"This is not Winterfell,On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns.Youre no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you."
1166,Benjen,Jon,"Ill be fifteen on my name day,Almost a man grown."
1167,Benjen,Jon,"A boy you are, and a boy youll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Nights Watch."
1168,Benjen,Jon,"Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now."
1169,Jon,Tyrion,"How often must I tell you no, Jon?Well speak when I return."
1170,Arya,Sansa,my half brother
1171,Grenn,Jon,"You broke my wrist, bastard boy."
1172,Grenn,Jon,Ill break the other one for you if you ask nicely.
1173,Grenn,Jon,"Maybe well break you,Try."
1174,Grenn,Jon,"You make us look bad,You looked bad before I ever met you,"
1175,Grenn,Jon,"The little lordling has a mouth on him,"
1176,Grenn,Jon,"Is that your mommys mouth, bastard?"
1177,Grenn,Jon,Maybe I had her a time or two.
1178,Donal,Jon,STOP THIS!NOW!
1179,Donal,Jon,"The yard is for fighting,Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or Ill make them my quarrels.You wont like that."
1180,Donal,Grenn,He tried to kill me. S true. one of the rapers put in.
1181,Aemon,Grenn,A bruise.
1182,Aemon,Jon,You stay.
1183,Donal,Jon,"The Watch has need of every man it can get,Even men like Toad.You wont win any honors killing him."
1184,Donal,Jon,He said my mother was-
1185,Donal,Jon,"What of it?Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,His honor--did not prevent him from fathering a bastard."
1186,Donal,Jon,Can I go?You go when I tell you to go.
1187,Donal,Jon,"Look at me when Im talking to you, boy."
1188,Eddard,Jon,Words wont make your mother a whore.
1189,Eddard,Jon,"You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores."
1190,Eddard,Jon,"You think you had it hard, being a high lords bastard?"
1191,Eddard,Jon,"That boy Jeren is a septons get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench.Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.I dont care,I dont care about them and I dont care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it."
1192,Eddard,Jon,its cold.Yes.
1193,Jon,Stannis,"This is the way it is, and youre here for life, same as the rest of us.Life,"
1194,Donal,Jon,"Yes, life,A long life or a short one, its up to you, Snow.The road youre walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.Theyre not my brothers,They hate me because Im better than they are.No."
1195,Donal,Jon,They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks hes a lordling.
1196,Donal,Jon,Youre no lordling.
1197,Donal,Jon,Youre a bastard and a bully.A bully?
1198,Donal,Jon,They were the ones who came after me.Four of them.Four that youve humiliated in the yard.
1199,Donal,Jon,Does that make you proud?
1200,Donal,Jon,"Theyre all older than me,Older and bigger and stronger, thats the truth."
1201,Donal,Jon,"Who was he, some old knight?Ser Rodrik Cassel,"
1202,Donal,Jon,"Now think on this, boy."
1203,Alliser,Jon,"They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword."
1204,Alliser,Jon,"So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?Dont call me that!"
1205,Alliser,Jon,I never .
1206,Alliser,Jon,".Best you start thinking,That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed.Now go."
1207,Jon,Tyrion,"And beyond a doubt the most useless,"
1208,Jon,Tyrion,"Makes you wonder what lies beyond,"
1209,Jon,Tyrion,"Lannister.I didnt see-I mean, I thought I was alone."
1210,Jon,Tyrion,"Theres much to be said for taking people unawares.You never know what you might learn.You wont learn anything from me,"
1211,Alliser,Bowen,"Oh, I learn things everywhere I go."
1212,Bowen,Jon,As I was saying .
1213,Benjen,Jon,"why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know whats on the other side?"
1214,Benjen,Jon,"You do want to know whats on the other side, dont you?Its nothing special,"
1215,Mance,Tyrion,"The rangers say its just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.And the grumkins and the snarks,Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else whats that big thing for?Dont call me Lord Snow."
1216,Mance,Tyrion,Would you rather be called the Imp?
1217,Jon,Tyrion,Then they cant hurt you with it anymore.
1218,Jon,Tyrion,"Come, walk with me.Theyll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot."
1219,Jon,Robert,"I dont see your wolf,I chain him up in the old stables when were training."
1220,Jon,Robert,"My sleeping cell is in Hardins Tower.Thats the one with the broken battlement, no?"
1221,Jon,Robert,I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.
1222,Jon,Robert,"No one cares where you sleep.Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want."
1223,Jon,Tyrion,"Ill be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses."
1224,Benjen,Jon,"Its better that Im by myself,The rest of them are scared of Ghost.Wise boys,"
1225,Benjen,Jon,"The talk is, your uncle is too long away."
1226,Benjen,Jon,"He said hed be back by my name day,"
1227,Benjen,Jon,"They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn."
1228,Benjen,Jon,"Thats all the way up in the mountains.I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,"
1229,Benjen,Jon,Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.
1230,Jon,Tyrion,"Barley, onion, carrot,Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isnt a meat.Its mutton stew."
1231,Alliser,Jon,Snow.
1232,Alliser,Jon,The Lord Commander wants to see you.Now.
1233,Alliser,Tyrion,Is it my uncle?
1234,Alliser,Tyrion,"Is he returned safe?The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards."
1235,Alliser,Tyrion,"Stop it, Thorne.Youre frightening the boy.Keep out of matters that dont concern you, Lannister.You have no place here.I have a place at court, though,A word in the right ear, and youll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train."
1236,Alliser,Jon,"Is there news of his uncle?No,This is another matter entirely.A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother."
1237,Alliser,Jon,"His half brother.Bran,Somethings happened to Bran."
1238,Jon,Tyrion,"Jon,I am truly sorry."
1239,Jeor,Jon,"Bran,What does it say about Bran?"
1240,Jeor,Jon,I am told you can read.
1241,Jon,Robb,"Com, Com, com. "
1242,Bran,Robb,"He woke up,The gods gave him back.Crippled,Im sorry, boy.Read the rest of the letter."
1243,Bran,Jon,"My brother is going to live,"
1244,Daenerys,Drogo,Live!
1245,Jon,Robb,"My brother is going to live,"
1246,Jon,Tyrion,Bran is going to live!
1247,Grenn,Jon,"Here, read it,"
1248,Jon,Robb,"Stay away from me now, you bastard."
1249,Jon,Robb,Im sorry about your wrist.
1250,Alliser,Jon,"Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that."
1251,Alliser,Jon,Lord Snow wants to take my place now.
1252,Grenn,Jon,"Id have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.Ill take that wager, Ser Alliser,Id love to see Ghost juggle."
1253,Alliser,Jon,"That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,"
1254,Eddard,Pycelle,"It will be convenient on the morrow,"
1255,Eddard,Pycelle,"I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.No, damn it,"
1256,Eddard,Vayon,"I will see them.Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.Yes, my lord,We have given you Lord Arryns former chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if it please you.I shall have your things taken there.My thanks,"
1257,Eddard,Vayon,It seems the council has urgent need of me.
1258,Eddard,Jory,Arya is not to go exploring.
1259,Eddard,Jory,"My wagons are still straggling through the city.I shall need appropriate garments.It will be my great pleasure,"
1260,Joffrey,Varys,"Lord Stark, I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad."
1261,Eddard,Joffrey,I pray for his recovery.
1262,Eddard,Joffrey,"Your gods have heard you,The prince grows stronger every day."
1263,Eddard,Renly,"I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,And you as well,You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert.A poor copy,Though much better dressed,Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court."
1264,Petyr,Renly,"There are worse crimes,The wayyou dress, for one."
1265,Eddard,Petyr,"I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark.No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.She has,"
1266,Renly,Varys,I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
1267,Petyr,Varys,"Rather too well,I still carry a token of his esteem.Did Brandon speak of me too?Often, and with some heat,"
1268,Eddard,Petyr,"I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,Here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish.You may count on it.Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well."
1269,Eddard,Petyr,"Well enough for a man of my years, my lord,yet I do tire easily, I fear."
1270,Eddard,Varys,"Perhaps we might begin soon,I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer.As you will."
1271,Eddard,Varys,"My lords,I am sorry to have kept you waiting.You are the Kings Hand,We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark."
1272,Eddard,Renly,"We are but five,Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides   beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,"
1273,Renly,Varys,"If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.Our good King Robert has many cares,He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten his load.What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears,so it falls to us to govern the realm."
1274,Eddard,Petyr,This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once.He has an urgent task for us.
1275,Eddard,Petyr,"Gods be good,What Lord Eddard means to say,is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.How much?"
1276,Eddard,Petyr,"Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion.Twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition.Ninety thousand gold pieces,And we must not neglect the other costs."
1277,Pycelle,Renly,"Fools we have in plenty,Will the treasury bear the expense?What treasury is that?"
1278,Petyr,Pycelle,"Spare me the foolishness, Maester."
1279,Eddard,Petyr,"We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?"
1280,Eddard,Petyr,"Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark."
1281,Eddard,Petyr,The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.
1282,Eddard,Petyr,Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold.How could you let this happen?
1283,Eddard,Petyr,"The master of coin finds the money.The king and the Hand spend it.I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,"
1284,Eddard,Pycelle,"Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,and he loathes what he calls counting coppers. I will speak with His Grace,This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.Speak to him as you will,we had still best make our plans.Another day,"
1285,Eddard,Pycelle,"Forgive me, my lords,I am tired.Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher."
1286,Eddard,Petyr,"Youre going the wrong way, Stark.Come with me."
1287,Eddard,Petyr,"This is not the way to my chambers,Did I say it was? Petyr replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm."
1288,Eddard,Petyr,Then it appears someone has managed   an astonishing impersonation.
1289,Eddard,Petyr,"Or dont come, and Ill keep her for myself."
1290,Eddard,Petyr,"Were outside the castle,You are a hard man to fool, Stark,Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky?"
1291,Eddard,Petyr,"Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand."
1292,Eddard,Petyr,"You are growing old and slow, Stark,No matter, we ride the rest of the way."
1293,Eddard,Petyr,"A brothel,Youve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.Your wife is inside,"
1294,Eddard,Petyr,"Brandon was too kind to you,My lord, no,He speaks the truth."
1295,Eddard,Rodrik,"This is no business of yours,"
1296,Eddard,Rodrik,Ser Rodfik?
1297,Eddard,Rodrik,Your lady awaits you upstairs.
1298,Eddard,Rodrik,Catelyn is truly here?This is not some strange jape of Petyrs?
1299,Eddard,Petyr,"Would that it were, Stark,Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the Kings Hand."
1300,Eddard,Petyr,"Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing."
1301,Eddard,Petyr,"My lady,Oh, very good,You recognized her.I feared youd never come, my lord,Petyr has been bringing me reports."
1302,Arya,Eddard,"How are my girls?Both in mourning, and full of anger,Cat, I do not understand."
1303,Arya,Eddard,Whats happened?
1304,Catelyn,Eddard,Is it Bran?
1305,Catelyn,Eddard,.
1306,Catelyn,Eddard,"It is Bran, but not as you think,"
1307,Catelyn,Eddard,Then how?
1308,Eddard,Petyr,"What is this place?Just what it appears,A brothel.Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?"
1309,Eddard,Petyr,"As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made.I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in Kings Landing.Why?"
1310,Catelyn,Eddard,Youve been hurt.
1311,Catelyn,Eddard,Gods.
1312,Catelyn,Eddard,"how did this happen, my lady?"
1313,Catelyn,Eddard,This blade was sent to open Brans throat and spill his lifes blood.
1314,Catelyn,Eddard,But .
1315,Eddard,Varys,"Let me tell it all, my love."
1316,Eddard,Varys,Listen.
1317,Eddard,Sansa,"The Imps dagger,"
1318,Eddard,Petyr,Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead?The boy has never done him harm.Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?
1319,Eddard,Petyr,The Imp would never have acted alone.
1320,Eddard,Petyr,"If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself ... no, I will not believe that."
1321,Lyanna,Petyr,"Most likely the king did not know,It would not be the first time.Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see."
1322,Ilyn,Petyr,The accusation is treason either way.
1323,Eddard,Robert,"We have proof,We have the dagger.This?"
1324,Eddard,Petyr,"A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord.The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?"
1325,Eddard,Petyr,My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.
1326,Catelyn,Eddard,"Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell."
1327,Catelyn,Petyr,"If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.A fool I may be, Stark ."
1328,Catelyn,Petyr,"If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.You wound me deeply."
1329,Catelyn,Petyr,"For my part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend."
1330,Catelyn,Petyr,"A fools task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife   anything."
1331,Catelyn,Petyr,"I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.A moment alone, thats all I ask,Very well."
1332,Catelyn,Petyr,"Dont be too long.It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle, before our absence is noted."
1333,Catelyn,Petyr,"I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr."
1334,Eddard,Petyr,I have found a brother Id thought lost.
1335,Eddard,Petyr,"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady."
1336,Eddard,Petyr,"I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.Oh, now theres a treasure,"
1337,Eddard,Petyr,"Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal."
1338,Catelyn,Theon,"If there is war, we shall have sore need of his fathers fleet.War?"
1339,Catelyn,Eddard,"It will not come to that,"
1340,Catelyn,Eddard,"The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have."
1341,Catelyn,Eddard,"If,what then, my love?"
1342,Catelyn,Eddard,"All justice flows from the king,When I know the truth, I must go to Robert."
1343,Eddard,Tyrion,Are you certain that you must leave us so soon?
1344,Eddard,Tyrion,"Past certain, Lord Mormont,My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me.He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.Would that I could."
1345,Alliser,Tyrion,"Youre a cunning man, Tyrion.We have need of men of your sort on the Wall."
1346,Alliser,Tyrion,"Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont."
1347,Alliser,Tyrion,"Lannister mocks us.Only you, Ser Alliser,"
1348,Alliser,Tyrion,You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man.Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.Why?
1349,Alliser,Tyrion,The crabs are here.
1350,Alliser,Tyrion,Come and make your j apes with steel in your hand.
1351,Alliser,Tyrion,"Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork.Shall we duel?"
1352,Alliser,Tyrion,Duel!
1353,Alliser,Tyrion,Duel!
1354,Alliser,Tyrion,"To the victor goes the spoils,I claim Thornes share of the crabs."
1355,Bowen,Tyrion,"You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,"
1356,Bowen,Tyrion,"If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him.I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser.Not so,You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains."
1357,Bowen,Tyrion,"Ill wager the lads have a few names for him as well,Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords.Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young warriors.The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,That seems to be all they send us these days."
1358,Jaremy,Ryk,"He fought bravely at Kings Landing.On the wrong side,I ought to know, I was there on the battlements beside him."
1359,Ryk,Tywin,"No offense intended, Tyrion.None taken, Ser Jaremy."
1360,Jaremy,Tyrion,"I think you would have looked very striking up there.Thank you,"
1361,Ryk,Tyrion,"Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion.You do mock us and our noble purpose here."
1362,Ryk,Tyrion,"We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously.More wine, please."
1363,Aemon,Bowen,"You have a great thirst for a small man.Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,"
1364,Aemon,Tyrion,"I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.Ive been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.Nonetheless,I think it is true."
1365,Aemon,Tyrion,"You are too kind, Maester Aemon."
1366,Eddison,Tyrion,"I have been called many things, my lord,but kind is seldom one of them."
1367,Maege,Tyrion,"The kingsroad can be perilous this far north,I have Jyck and Morrec,and Yoren is riding south again.Yoren is only one man. Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument. Tyrion said."
1368,Maege,Tyrion,Snow?
1369,Maege,Tyrion,I have nieces I have never seen.
1370,Maege,Tyrion,"Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy.You shall have three strong swords, to keep you safe.I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont."
1371,Maege,Tyrion,"I hope I can repay your kindness.You can,Your sister sits beside the king."
1372,Eddison,Tyrion,"Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.Three and a third,"
1373,Eddison,Tyrion,"I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royces son, lost on his first ranging."
1374,Eddard,Tyrion,"Fool, "
1375,Eddard,Tyrion,"Fool, "
1376,Eddard,Tyrion,"Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall,"
1377,Alliser,Eddard,"One deserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing."
1378,Alliser,Eddard,Who am I to send searching after him?
1379,Robert,Tyrion,Now it is all we can do to stay alive.
1380,Robert,Tyrion,"I promise, the king will hear of your need,and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well."
1381,Jaime,Tywin,"You are a young man, Tyrion,How many winters have you seen?"
1382,Jaime,Tywin,"Eight, nine.I misremember.And all of them short.As you say, my lord."
1383,Jaime,Tyrion,"When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come."
1384,Aemon,Tyrion,"Think on that.When I was a boy,my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending."
1385,Aemon,Tyrion,"You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord."
1386,Aemon,Tyrion,The end of summer stares us in the face.
1387,Aemon,Tyrion,You must make them understand.
1388,Aemon,Tyrion,"There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams.In your dreams,"
1389,Aemon,Tyrion,The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore.
1390,Aemon,Tyrion,"The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before."
1391,Aemon,Tyrion,but running from what?
1392,Aemon,Tyrion,"These are old bones, Lannister, but they have never felt a chill like this."
1393,Eddison,Tyrion,The gods help us all if we are not ready.The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight.Yoren is determined to ride at first light.
1394,Eddison,Tyrion,"I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, Lord Mormont.Tell them, Tyrion."
1395,Eddison,Tyrion,That is all the thanks I need.
1396,Eddison,Tyrion,"Seven hells, its the dwarf,Bring him in, damn it."
1397,Eddison,Tyrion,"And what will you be   wanting, this time of night?"
1398,Eddison,Tyrion,A last look.
1399,Eddison,Tyrion,"Look all you want,Just have a care you dont fall off, little man.The Old Bear would have our hides."
1400,Jon,Tyrion,Who goes there?Halt!
1401,Jon,Tyrion,"If I halt too long Ill freeze in place, Jon,Hello, Ghost."
1402,Jon,Tyrion,"Lannister,This is the last place I would have expected to see you."
1403,Jon,Tyrion,"This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,I was captured by a whim.If I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?Not with me here,"
1404,Alliser,Jon,What are you doing up here tonight?
1405,Alliser,Jon,Besides freezing your manhood off .
1406,Alliser,Jon,".I have drawn night guard,Again."
1407,Grenn,Tyrion,So far I have disappointed him.
1408,Grenn,Tyrion,"And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?No,but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did.Pyp?Pypar is his real name."
1409,Grenn,Tyrion,Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.
1410,Grenn,Tyrion,"I have a mile of Wall to guard.Will you walk with me?If you walk slowly,The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how fast."
1411,Jon,Tyrion,"I leave on the morrow,I know."
1412,Jon,Tyrion,I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south.
1413,Jon,Tyrion,".Tell Robb that Im going to command the Nights Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.Your brother is bigger than me,I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed.Rickon will ask when Im coming home."
1414,Bran,Tyrion,"Tell him he can have all my things while Im away, hell like that."
1415,Bran,Tyrion,"You could put all this in a letter, you know.Rickon cant read yet."
1416,Bran,Tyrion,.
1417,Bran,Jon,"I dont know what message to send to Bran.Help him, Tyrion.What help could I give him?"
1418,Jon,Tyrion,"I have no spells to give him back his legs.You gave me help when I needed it,I gave you nothing,Words.Then give your words to Bran too.Youre asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque."
1419,Jon,Tyrion,"I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power.Thank you, my lord of Lannister."
1420,Jon,Tyrion,Friend.
1421,Jon,Tyrion,"Most of my kin are bastards,but youre the first Ive had to friend."
1422,Jon,Tyrion,"My uncle is out there,The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and Ill see him first and blow the horn."
1423,Jon,Tyrion,"Not that night and not any night.Give him time,"
1424,Jon,Tyrion,"If he doesnt come back,Ghost and I will go find him."
1425,Jon,Tyrion,"I believe you,"
1426,Jory,Small,"My lord,"
1427,Eddard,Jory,"Be seated,I see you have started without me.I am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city."
1428,Arya,Jory,"The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King."
1429,Arya,Sansa,Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?
1430,Mordane,Sansa,"A tourney,"
1431,Arya,Robert,"Will we be permitted to go, Father?You know my feelings, Sansa."
1432,Mordane,Sansa,"That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.Oh, please,I want to see."
1433,Mordane,Sansa,"Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa.All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, and as the tourney is in your honor, it would look queer if your family did not attend."
1434,Arya,Mordane,"I suppose so.Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa."
1435,Arya,Joffrey,"For both of you.I dont care about their stupid tourney,"
1436,Joffrey,Sansa,It will be a splendid event.You shant be wanted.
1437,Joffrey,Sansa,"Enough, Sansa."
1438,Arya,Sansa,"I expect you to behave like sisters, is that understood?"
1439,Jeyne,Sansa,"Pray excuse me,I find I have small appetite tonight."
1440,Desmond,Hullen,"Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the joust.Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all."
1441,Jon,Robb,little sister
1442,Sansa,Vayon,"Know the men who follow you,and let them know you."
1443,Arya,Eddison,"Arya Underfoot,Arya Horseface."
1444,Arya,Jory,"He was my ffiend,"
1445,Arya,Mordane,"Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?"
1446,Arya,Mordane,Im not hungry.
1447,Arya,Mordane,"May I be excused, please?"
1448,Arya,Mordane,"You may not,You have scarcely touched your food.You will sit down and clean your plate.You clean it!"
1449,Arya,Mordane,"Here now, little one, hold on,"
1450,Jeyne,Sansa,"Arya girl, whats wrong?"
1451,Jeyne,Sansa,You in there?No!
1452,Arya,Mordane,"Arya Stark, you open this door at once, do you hear me?"
1453,Arya,Mordane,You better not come in here!
1454,Arya,Mordane,The Hand will hear of this!
1455,Arya,Mordane,"I dont care,Go away.You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that."
1456,Arya,Jon,"Arya,Open the door.We need to talk."
1457,Arya,Jon,May I come in?
1458,Arya,Eddard,Whose sword is that?Mine.
1459,Arya,Eddard,Give it to me.
1460,Arya,Eddard,"A bravos blade,Yet it seems to me that I know this makers mark.This is Mikkens work."
1461,Arya,Eddard,"My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know nothing of it."
1462,Arya,Jon,Where did you get this?
1463,Arya,Jon,"I dont suppose it matters, truly."
1464,Arya,Jon,"This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl.What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords?I wasnt playing,I hate Septa Mordane.Thats enough."
1465,Arya,Jon,"The septa is doing no more than is her duty, though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman.Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady.I dont want to be a lady!"
1466,Arya,Lyanna,"I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now, and put an end to this nonsense.Needle wouldnt break,It has a name, does it?"
1467,Arya,Lyanna,"Ah, Arya."
1468,Arya,Brandon,It brought them both to an early grave.
1469,Arya,Brandon,"Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it."
1470,Arya,Brandon,"You even look like her.Lyanna was beautiful,"
1471,Arya,Mordane,"She was,beautiful, and willful, and dead before her time."
1472,Arya,Mordane,"Arya, what did you think to do with this ."
1473,Jon,Mordane,Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
1474,Arya,Jon,"Stick them with the pointy end,"
1475,Arya,Jon,"That is the essence of it, I suppose."
1476,Arya,Jon,"I was trying to learn, but ."
1477,Arya,Jon,.
1478,Arya,Jon,I asked Mycah to practice with me.
1479,Arya,Jon,"I asked him,It was my fault, it was me ."
1480,Arya,Joffrey,.
1481,Arya,Joffrey,"No, sweet one,Grieve for your friend, but never blame yourself."
1482,Arya,Joffrey,"That murder lies at the Hounds door, him and the cruel woman he serves.I hate them,Sandor and the queen and the king and Prince Joffrey."
1483,Arya,Sansa,"She did remember, she just lied so Joffrey would like her.We all lie,Or did you truly think Id believe that Nymeria ran off?"
1484,Arya,Sansa,"Jory promised not to tell.Jory kept his word,There are some things I do not need to be told.Even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly.We had to throw rocks,I told her to run, to go be free, that I didnt want her   anymore."
1485,Arya,Jory,"The queen would have killed her.It was right,And even the lie was ."
1486,Arya,Jory,not without honor.
1487,Arya,Eddison,"Arya, sit down.I need to try and explain some things to you."
1488,Arya,Eddison,"You are too young to be burdened with all my cares,but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. Arya whispered. her father said."
1489,Arya,Mordane,"Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.The direwolf,"
1490,Arya,Mordane,"Let me tell you something about wolves, child."
1491,Arya,Sansa,"and I need both of you, gods help me."
1492,Arya,Sansa,"I dont hate Sansa,Not truly."
1493,Arya,Sansa,"I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you."
1494,Arya,Eddison,"It is time to begin growing up.I will,"
1495,Arya,Mordane,I can be strong too.I can be as strong as Robb.
1496,Arya,Mordane,"Here.,, She looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes.Go on, its yours,I can keep it?"
1497,Arya,Mordane,For true?For true.
1498,Arya,Mordane,"If I took it away, no doubt Id find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight.Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.I wont.I promise."
1499,Arya,Small,"You are late, boy."
1500,Arya,Small,Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
1501,Arya,Small,Who are you?
1502,Arya,Small,I am your dancing master.
1503,Arya,Small,Tomorrow you will catch it.Now pick it up.
1504,Arya,Eddison,"That is not the way, boy."
1505,Arya,Eddison,"You will take the blade in one hand.Its too heavy,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing."
1506,Arya,Eddison,One hand now is all that is needing.
1507,Arya,Syrio,The left is good.
1508,Arya,Syrio,Let me see.
1509,Arya,Syrio,"Just so, yes.Do not squeeze it so tight, no, the grip must be deft, delicate.What if I drop it?"
1510,Arya,Syrio,"The steel must be part of your arm,Can you drop part of your arm?"
1511,Arya,Syrio,"Listen to him, boy.boy.Im a girl,Boy, girl,You are a sword, that is all."
1512,Arya,Syrio,"Just so, that is the grip.   ~--needle, Just so."
1513,Arya,Syrio,"When you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die."
1514,Arya,Syrio,"Now you will try to strike me.,, Arya tried to strike him."
1515,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Dothraki sea,"
1516,Daenerys,Jorah,"Its so green,Here and now,You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood."
1517,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world, and then all life will end."
1518,Daenerys,Jorah,"I dont want to talk about that now,Its so beautiful here, I dont want to think about everything dying.As you will, Khaleesi,"
1519,Illyrio,Viserys,"And if he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon,"
1520,Daenerys,Viserys,"Wait here,Tell them all to stay.Tell them I command it."
1521,Daenerys,Jorah,"You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.Not a queen,A khaleesi. "
1522,Eddison,Illyrio,"Khaleesi, what is wrong?"
1523,Daenerys,Viserys,You dare!
1524,Daenerys,Viserys,You give commands to me?To me?
1525,Daenerys,Viserys,Have you forgotten who you are?
1526,Daenerys,Viserys,Look at you!
1527,Daenerys,Viserys,You do not command the dragon.
1528,Daenerys,Viserys,"I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselords slut, do you hear me?"
1529,Daenerys,Viserys,Do you hear me?
1530,Daenerys,Irri,"Jhogo asks if you would have him dead, Khaleesi, No,No."
1531,Irri,Jhogo,Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.
1532,Daenerys,Irri,"Tell them I do not wish him harmed,"
1533,Daenerys,Jorah,"I warned him what would happen, my lady,I told him to stay on the ridge, as you commanded.I know you did,"
1534,Daenerys,Jorah,"Take his horse,"
1535,Daenerys,Viserys,Let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar.
1536,Jorah,Viserys,Let everyone see him as he is.No!
1537,Daenerys,Jorah,"Hit her, Mormont."
1538,Daenerys,Jorah,Kill these Dothraki dogs and teach her.
1539,Daenerys,Viserys,"He shall walk, Khaleesi,"
1540,Daenerys,Jorah,Will he find his way back?
1541,Daenerys,Jorah,"Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,He is proud.He may be too shamed to come back."
1542,Daenerys,Jorah,Where else should he go?
1543,Daenerys,Jorah,"It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child."
1544,Daenerys,Jorah,"I hit him,"
1545,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ser Jorah, do you think ."
1546,Daenerys,Jorah,"I woke the dragon, didnt IT Ser Jorah snorted.Can you wake the dead, girl?"
1547,Daenerys,Jorah,Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1548,Daenerys,Jorah,You .
1549,Daenerys,Jorah,".That I did, girl,And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make his servants?"
1550,Daenerys,Jorah,He is still the true king.
1551,Daenerys,Jorah,.
1552,Daenerys,Jorah,Truth now.Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?
1553,Daenerys,Jorah,"He would not be a very good king, would he?There have been worse ."
1554,Daenerys,Jorah,but not many.
1555,Daenerys,Jorah,"Still,the common people are waiting for him. Ser Jorah told her."
1556,Daenerys,Jorah,They never are.
1557,Daenerys,Jorah,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1558,Daenerys,Jorah,"Home,"
1559,Daenerys,Jorah,"I pray for home too,"
1560,Daenerys,Jorah,"Look around you then, Khaleesi."
1561,Daenerys,Jorah,"My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,"
1562,Daenerys,Jorah,"You think not.He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake."
1563,Daenerys,Jorah,He will never take us home.Wise child.
1564,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am no child,"
1565,Daenerys,Doreah,"The sun,The sun warmed them as they rode."
1566,Irri,Jhiqui,Have you ever seen a dragon?
1567,Irri,Jhiqui,"Dragons are gone, Khaleesi,Dead,Long and long ago."
1568,Daenerys,Mag,Everywhere?
1569,Daenerys,Mag,Even in the east?
1570,Irri,Jhiqui,"No dragon,Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts.It is known.It is known,A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,"
1571,Daenerys,Illyrio,"The moon?He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat."
1572,Irri,Moon,"One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return."
1573,Irri,Moon,"You are foolish strawhead slave,Moon is no egg."
1574,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"It is known.It is known,"
1575,Daenerys,Doreah,"Doreah, stay and eat with me,"
1576,Daenerys,Drogo,"You honor me, Khaleesi, "
1577,Daenerys,Drogo,"This night we must go outside, my lord,"
1578,Daenerys,Doreah,"No,This night I would look on your face."
1579,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Khaleesi, you are with child.I know,"
1580,Bran,Nan,"It was just a lie,I cant fly.I cant even run.Crows are all liars,I know a story about a crow.I dont want any more stories,"
1581,Bran,Nan,I hate your stupid stories.
1582,Bran,Nan,My stories?
1583,Bran,Nan,"The stories are, before me and after me, before you too."
1584,Hodor,Nan,"I dont care whose stories they are,I hate them."
1585,Bran,Nan,"I know a story about a boy who hated stories,"
1586,Bran,Jon,"Ofttimes the birds are lost, child,Theres many a mile and many a hawk between here and Kings Landing, the message may not have reached them."
1587,Nan,Theon,"I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder,That was always your favorite."
1588,Bran,Brandon,"Thats not my favorite,My favorites were the scary ones."
1589,Bran,Nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child,"
1590,Bran,Nan,"Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.You mean the Others,The Others,Thousands and thousands of years A GAML OF THRONLS  ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man."
1591,Bran,Nan,"Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.So, child. Bran said reluctantly, "
1592,Bran,Nan,"In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins."
1593,Bran,Nan,"They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children."
1594,Bran,Nan,"Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest."
1595,Daenerys,Drogo," The door opened with a bang, and Brans heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear, but it was only Maester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him."
1596,Bran,Luwin,"We have visitors,and your presence is required, Bran.Im listening to a story now,Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there they are,Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories of their own.Who is it?"
1597,Luwin,Robb,"Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Nights Watch, with word from your brother Jon."
1598,Hodor,Robb,"Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?Hodor!"
1599,Hodor,Theon,"Hodor,"
1600,Hodor,Walder,Hodor
1601,Hodor,Robb,"Any man of the Nights Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay,"
1602,Bran,Robb,"Any man of the Nights Watch,but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?"
1603,Bran,Robb,"I am the lord here while my mother and father are away, Lannister.I am not your boy.If you are a lord, you might learn a lords courtesy,Your bastard brother has all your fathers graces, it would seem.Jon, "
1604,Hodor,Robb,"So it is true, the boy lives."
1605,Hodor,Robb,"You Starks are hard to kill.You Lannisters had best remember that,Hodor, bring my brother here.Hodor,"
1606,Bran,Robb,"You said you had business with Bran.Well, here he is, Lannister."
1607,Bran,Tyrion,"I am told you were quite the climber, Bran,Tell me, how is it you happened to fall that day?I never,"
1608,Luwin,Tyrion,"The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,Curious,My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,Do your business and be on your way.I have a gift for you,Do you like to ride, boy?"
1609,Bran,Luwin,"My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs.He cannot sit a horse.Nonsense,With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride."
1610,Bran,Luwin,"Im not a cripple!Then I am not a dwarf,My father will rejoice to hear it."
1611,Bran,Luwin,What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?
1612,Bran,Luwin,"A smart horse,The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the voice.I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be unlearned."
1613,Bran,Luwin,Give this to your saddler.He will provide the rest.
1614,Bran,Luwin,I see.
1615,Bran,Luwin,"I should have thought of this myself.It came easier to me, Maester.It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.Will I truly be able to ride?"
1616,Bran,Robb,"You will,And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of them."
1617,Bran,Robb,"Is this some trap, Lannister?"
1618,Bran,Tyrion,Why should you want to help him?Your brother Jon asked it of me.And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things.
1619,Theon,Tyrion,"The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,Perhaps its time I took my leave,"
1620,Bran,Robb,No!
1621,Bran,Robb,"Summer, here.Summer, to me!"
1622,Bran,Robb,Grey Wind.
1623,Rickon,Tyrion,"Rickon, call him,Home, Shaggy, home now."
1624,Robb,Tyrion,"How interesting.Are you well, my lord?"
1625,Bran,Robb,"My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity."
1626,Bran,Robb,The wolves .
1627,Bran,Robb,.No doubt they mistook me for dinner.
1628,Bran,Luwin,"I thank you for calling them off, young ser."
1629,Luwin,Robb,"And now I will be leaving, truly.A moment, my lord,"
1630,Bran,Robb,I .
1631,Cersei,Sansa, he said.
1632,Bran,Robb,.
1633,Bran,Robb,"The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it, Lannister.Spare me your false courtesies, boy."
1634,Rickon,Robb,For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me.
1635,Rickon,Robb,"Yoren, we go south at daybreak.You will find me on the road, no doubt."
1636,Bran,Robb,"I have had rooms prepared, and youll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road.I hope you will honor us at table tonight."
1637,Hodor,Nan,"Hodor,"
1638,Bran,Robb,"Summer,"
1639,Bran,Robb,"I can ride now,We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see."
1640,Bran,Hodor,"I didnt hear,I didnt, I didnt."
1641,Bran,Hodor,"I didnt hear,Hodor,"
1642,Bran,Jon,"Ser Allisers bane,"
1643,Bran,Yoren,What is it?
1644,Bran,Yoren,"Theres hard news, mlords, and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer.Starks gone.The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and hes late returning, my lord.Too long,Most like hes dead.My uncle is not dead,"
1645,Bran,Yoren,Do you hear me?My uncle is not dead!
1646,Robb,Yoren,"Whatever you say, mlord,"
1647,Bran,Nan,"Theres not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark.Hell find his way back.Well,maybe he will and maybe he wont."
1648,Luwin,Theon,"The children will help him,the children of the forest!Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years. Yoren said, Up there, a man cant always tell whats alive and whats dead."
1649,Bran,Robb,"Well find a horse for you, I promise,Are they ever coming back?"
1650,Bran,Robb,"Yes,Mother will be home soon."
1651,Bran,Robb,"Wouldnt that surprise her, to see you ahorse?"
1652,Bran,Jon,"And afterward, well ride north to see the Wall."
1653,Bran,Jon,"It will be an adventure.An adventure,"
1654,Pycelle,Robb,"Lord Arryns death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing."
1655,Eddard,Pycelle,I find it most refreshing in this heat.
1656,Eddard,Pycelle,"That would be most kind,"
1657,Eddard,Pycelle,"Iced milk for the Kings Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child.Well sweetened."
1658,Eddard,Pycelle,The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest.
1659,Eddard,Pycelle,"On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows."
1660,Eddard,Pycelle,"To be sure, King Maekars summer was hotter than this one, and near as long."
1661,Eddard,Pycelle,The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.
1662,Eddard,Pycelle,"My pardons, Lord Eddard."
1663,Eddard,Pycelle,"Ah, and here is our milk."
1664,Eddard,Pycelle,Sweet child.
1665,Eddard,Pycelle,Thank you.You may go.
1666,Eddard,Pycelle,Now where were we?
1667,Eddard,Pycelle,.I did.
1668,Eddard,Pycelle,"If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,We had sat together on council many a year, he and , and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long."
1669,Jon,Small,Yet now I am less certain.
1670,Jon,Small,What can you tell me of his final illness?
1671,Colemon,Small,"He came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply."
1672,Colemon,Pycelle,"When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away."
1673,Colemon,Pycelle,"I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that."
1674,Lysa,Pycelle,"He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?"
1675,Lysa,Pycelle,"In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say."
1676,Jon,Lysa,"His love was fierce to see.Was there nothing else?No final words?When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer."
1677,Eddard,Jon,He never spoke again.
1678,Eddard,Jon,Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryns death?Unnatural?
1679,Eddard,Pycelle,"No, I could not say so."
1680,Eddard,Pycelle,"Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last.This illness that took him,Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaeryss father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name."
1681,Eddard,Pycelle,Lord Jons death was no stranger than any other.
1682,Lysa,Pycelle,His wife thought otherwise.
1683,Lysa,Pycelle,"I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife."
1684,Lysa,Pycelle,"Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?I am,If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?Poison,"
1685,Eddard,Pycelle,A disturbing thought.
1686,Eddard,Pycelle,"Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt."
1687,Eddard,Pycelle,"What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely."
1688,Eddard,Pycelle,What sort of monster in mans flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?I have heard it said that poison is a womans weapon.
1689,Eddard,Pycelle,It is said.
1690,Eddard,Pycelle,and eunuchs.
1691,Eddard,Varys,"The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know?Put not your trust in spiders, my lord."
1692,Pycelle,Varys,"I will remember that, Maester."
1693,Pycelle,Varys,I have taken enough of your time.
1694,Eddard,Pycelle,"I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease.If there is any other service I might perform, you need only ask.One thing,I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill.I fear you would find it of little interest,It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses.Still, I should like to see it."
1695,Eddard,Pycelle,As you wish.
1696,Eddard,Pycelle,"You have been most courteous,"
1697,Pycelle,Tywin,"I wonder, was the queen with him?Why, no,She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father."
1698,Eddard,Nan,"Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart.Dark wings, dark words,"
1699,Nan,Pycelle,"So the fishwives say,but we know it is not always so."
1700,Eddard,Pycelle,"Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard.I am here to serve."
1701,Arya,Eddard,"Arya, what are you doing?Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours."
1702,Arya,Eddard,Which toe?
1703,Arya,Eddard,"Any toe,"
1704,Arya,Eddard,Must you do your standing here?
1705,Arya,Eddard,Its a long hard fall down these steps.Syrio says a water dancer never falls.
1706,Arya,Eddard,"Father, will Bran come and live with us now?Not for a long time, sweet one,He needs to win his strength back."
1707,Arya,Eddard,What will Bran do when hes of age?
1708,Arya,Eddard,"He has years to find that answer, Arya.For now, it is enough to know that he will live."
1709,Arya,Sansa,"I dreamed of Bran,I saw him smiling.He was going to be a knight,A knight of the Kingsguard.Can he still be a knight?No,"
1710,Arya,Eddard,"Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the kings council.He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mothers Faith and become the High Septon."
1711,Arya,Eddard,"Can I be a kings councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?You,will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon."
1712,Arya,Eddard,"No,thats Sansa."
1713,Alyn,Eddard,"My lord,Lord Baelish is without and begs audience.Escort him to my solar,Ill see him at once."
1714,Eddard,Petyr,"If only old Selmys mind were as nimble as his blade,our council meetings would be a good deal livelier.Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in Kings Landing."
1715,Eddard,Petyr,"And as tiresome,though I daresay he should do well in the tourney."
1716,Eddard,Petyr,"Is there a reason for this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?"
1717,Eddard,Petyr,"I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have."
1718,Eddard,Petyr,"You have something for me?Someone,Four someones, if truth be told.Had you thought to question the Hands servants?"
1719,Eddard,Lysa,Would that I could.Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie.
1720,Eddard,Jon,"Most of her household,"
1721,Eddard,Jon,"A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renlys grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryns squire.His squire?"
1722,Eddard,Petyr,"Ser Hugh of the Vale,The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryns death.I shall send for him,And the others."
1723,Eddard,Petyr,"My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.Why?Come, and Ill show you, my lord."
1724,Eddard,Petyr,"There, across the yard, at the door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?What of him?He reports to Varys.The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings."
1725,Eddard,Petyr,Now glance at the wall.
1726,Eddard,Petyr,The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?
1727,Eddard,Petyr,"Another of the eunuchs whisperers?No, this one belongs to the queen."
1728,Eddard,Petyr,Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel?
1729,Eddard,Petyr,"Seven hells,"
1730,Eddard,Petyr,"Is everyone someones informer in this cursed city?Scarcely,"
1731,Eddard,Petyr,"Why, theres me, you, the king ."
1732,Eddard,Petyr,"although, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and Im less than certain about you."
1733,Eddard,Petyr,"Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?Yes,In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may."
1734,Eddard,Petyr,"Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day."
1735,Eddard,Petyr,"Lord Petyr,I ."
1736,Eddard,Petyr,Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
1737,Eddard,Petyr,"You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard.Distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed down off your horse."
1738,Dareon,Jon,"Your feet should be farther apart,You dont want to lose your balance."
1739,Dareon,Jon,"Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade."
1740,Dareon,Jon,"Seven gods,Would you look at this, Jon."
1741,Alliser,Jon,They .
1742,Daenerys,Drogo, he said to no one in particular. Pyp observed to Jon.
1743,Dywen,Samwell,
1744,Alliser,Jon,"Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?"
1745,Alliser,Jon,"Let us hope you are not as inept as you look,Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do."
1746,Halder,Jon,"This will be uglier than a whores ass,"
1747,Alliser,Rast,"I yield,No more, I yield, dont hit me."
1748,Alliser,Halder,"On your feet, Ser Piggy,Pick up your sword."
1749,Alliser,Halder,Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet.
1750,Halder,Jon,"You can hit harder than that,"
1751,Alliser,Jon,"Jon, no,On your feet,"
1752,Alliser,Halder,"Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion,Again."
1753,Jon,Rast,Cut us off a ham!
1754,Halder,Jon,"Halder, enough."
1755,Alliser,Halder,"The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.Look at him, Haider,Theres no honor in beating a fallen foe.He yielded."
1756,Alliser,Jon,"He yielded,"
1757,Alliser,Jon,"It would seem our Bastard is in love,Show me your steel, Lord Snow."
1758,Albett,Rast,"The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it.Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here."
1759,Albett,Jon,"Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal.All you need do is get past the Bastard.Stay behind me,"
1760,Grenn,Jon,"Three to two will make for better sport,"
1761,Alliser,Rast,Why are you waiting?
1762,Albett,Alliser,"I yield,"
1763,Alliser,Dareon,The mummers farce has gone on long enough for today.
1764,Halder,Jon,"For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.For an instant, you did,"
1765,Halder,Jon,"Let me,"
1766,Halder,Randyll,Did he hurt you?Ive been bruised before.
1767,Halder,Randyll,"My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn ."
1768,Halder,Randyll,.
1769,Halder,Randyll,"I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I ."
1770,Jon,Samwell,"Im Jon Snow, Eddard Starks bastard, of Winterfell."
1771,Jon,Samwell,"I   My mother calls me SamwellYou can call him Lord Snow,You dont want to know what his mother calls him.These two are Grenn and Pypar,Grenns the ugly one,"
1772,Grenn,Jon,"Youre uglier than me.At least I dont have ears like a bat.My thanks to all of you,Why didnt you get up and fight?"
1773,Grenn,Jon,"I wanted to, truly."
1774,Grenn,Jon,I didnt want him to hit me anymore.
1775,Grenn,Jon,I My lord father always said so.
1776,Jon,Samwell,"I ... Im sorry,I dont mean to ."
1777,Jon,Samwell,to be like I am.
1778,Jon,Samwell,"You were hurt,Tomorrow youll do better."
1779,Grenn,Samwell,"No I wont,I never do better."
1780,Grenn,Samwell,"Nobody likes cravens,I wish we hadnt helped him.What if they think were craven too?Youre too stupid to be craven,I am not,Yes you are.If a bear attacked you in the woods, youd be too stupid to run away.I would not,Id run away faster than you."
1781,Jon,Samwell,"Is that a wolf?A direwolf,His name is Ghost.The direwolf is the sigil of my fathers House.Ours is a striding huntsman,Do you like to hunt?"
1782,Jon,Samwell,I hate it.
1783,Jon,Samwell,Whats wrong now?
1784,Jon,Samwell,Why are you always so frightened?
1785,Jon,Samwell,Lets go outside.
1786,Jon,Samwell,"Why?What will we do outside?Talk,Have you seen the Wall?Im fat, not blind,Of course I saw it, its seven hundred feet high."
1787,Jon,Samwell,"I never thought it would be like this,"
1788,Jon,Samwell,"All the buildings are falling down, and its so ."
1789,Jon,Samwell,.Cold?
1790,Jon,Samwell,"I hate the cold,Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.It must have been warmer where you come from.I never saw snow until last month."
1791,Jon,Samwell,I was afraid it would never end.
1792,Jon,Samwell,Are they going to make me go up there?
1793,Jon,Samwell,"Ill die if I have to climb that.Theres a winch,They can draw you up in a cage."
1794,Jon,Samwell,I dont like high places.
1795,Jon,Samwell,Are you afraid of everything?
1796,Jon,Samwell,I dont understand.
1797,Jon,Samwell,Why would a coward want to join the Nights Watch?
1798,Benjen,Robb,"Sometimes I dream about it,Im walking down this long empty hall."
1799,Benjen,Jaremy,"Most nights its my father, but sometimes its Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle."
1800,Jon,Samwell,Do you ever find anyone in your dream?
1801,Jon,Samwell,No one.The castle is always empty.
1802,Jon,Samwell,"Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones."
1803,Jon,Samwell,"It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream."
1804,Jon,Samwell,Thats when I always wake.
1805,Jon,Samwell,Do you dream of Horn Hill?
1806,Jon,Samwell,No.
1807,Jon,Samwell,I hated it there.
1808,Randyll,Samwell,"One time,"
1809,Randyll,Samwell,Father had them scourged.
1810,Randyll,Samwell,"You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickons."
1811,Randyll,Samwell,"If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die ."
1812,Jon,Samwell,Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are.
1813,Jon,Samwell,So.
1814,Jon,Samwell,"-he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping-"
1815,Jon,Samwell,We should go back to the common hall.Why?
1816,Dareon,Jon,"Theres hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer."
1817,Dareon,Samwell,"well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.How did he come here?"
1818,Dareon,Samwell,Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter.
1819,Dareon,Jon,"When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder."
1820,Dareon,Jon,"Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing."
1821,Jon,Samwell,Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.
1822,Jon,Samwell,"I should like to hear them both,but they would not want me there."
1823,Jon,Samwell,"Hes going to make me fight again on the morrow, isnt he?He is,"
1824,Jon,Samwell,I had better try to sleep.
1825,Grenn,Jon,Where haveyou been?
1826,Grenn,Jon,"Talking with SamwellHe truly is craven,At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.The Lord of Ham thinks hes too good to eat with the likes of us,I saw him eat a pork pie,Do you think it was a brother?"
1827,Grenn,Jon,Stop it!
1828,Halder,Jon,"Listen to me,"
1829,Jon,Rast,"You girls do as you please,but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, Im going to slice me off a rasher of bacon."
1830,Jon,Rast,"Remember, we know where you sleep,"
1831,Jon,Samwell,"I dont know what you did,but I know you did it."
1832,Jon,Samwell,"Ive never had a friend before.Were not friends,"
1833,Jon,Samwell,Were brothers.
1834,Benjen,Halder,"My uncle spoke truly,"
1835,Benjen,Eddard,"Its the Hands tourney thats the cause of all the trouble, my lords,The kings tourney,I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.Call it what you will, my lord."
1836,Renly,Varys,"No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to.How dreadful,"
1837,Janos,Renly,"If you cannot keep the kings peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1838,Eddard,Robert,"Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly.I need more men.How many?"
1839,Eddard,Petyr,"As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.Hire fifty new men,Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin.I will?"
1840,Eddard,Petyr,"You will.You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champions purse, surely you can scrape   together a few coppers to keep the kings peace."
1841,Eddard,Janos,"I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.All thanks, Lord Hand,I promise you, they shall be put to good use."
1842,Eddard,Janos,"The sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it.the Hands tourney,"
1843,Petyr,Pycelle,"The realm prospers from such events, my lord,They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.And put coins in many a pocket,Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step."
1844,Petyr,Renly,Were fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us.
1845,Eddard,Stannis,"He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty."
1846,Eddard,Petyr,"I wonder about your brother Stannis as well.I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council.No doubt as soon as weve scourged all those whores into the sea,I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,Until the morrow."
1847,Eddard,Harwin,"Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,As you say, my lord.Hands tourney"
1848,Eddard,Jory,"Ive promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,I rely on you to make the choice.Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights, not start them."
1849,Eddard,Jory,"Did you find the stableboy?The watchman, my lord,He vows hell never touch another horse.What did he have to say?He claims he knew Lord Arryn well.Fast friends, they were."
1850,Eddard,Jory,"The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days, he says."
1851,Eddard,Jory,"Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so they were always pleased to see him.Carrots and apples,"
1852,Eddard,Stannis,"Did our watchman recall anything else of note?The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age.Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he says."
1853,Eddard,Renly,Where did they go on these rides?
1854,Eddard,Renly,The boy says that they visited a brothel.A brothel?
1855,Eddard,Renly,The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis   Baratheon?
1856,Eddard,Stannis,"The boy insists its true.The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward.Which brothel?"
1857,Eddard,Stannis,"The boy did not know.The guards would.A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,The gods are doing their best to vex us.Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis ... everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?Not yet,Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands."
1858,Eddard,Jory,"Bring me my doublet, if you would."
1859,Eddard,Jory,It might make him more forthcoming.
1860,Eddard,Jory,Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king.Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.
1861,Eddard,Lyanna,"No,"
1862,Eddard,Jory,"Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Roberts tourney,That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,"
1863,Eddard,Jory,"In other words, not bloody likely."
1864,Eddard,Jon,"The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.Alyn knows   the way, my lord."
1865,Eddard,Jon,The gods help this potboy if hes sent me off haring after shadows.
1866,Eddard,Jory,"Is there any other service I might perform?I suppose youd best begin visiting whorehouses.Hard duty, my lord."
1867,Eddard,Jory,The men will be glad to help.Porther has made a fair start already.
1868,Bran,Eddison,"Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price,Blood melons, sweet as honey,Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here."
1869,Beric,Eddard,Make way for Lord Beric!
1870,Beric,Eddard,Make wayfor Lord Befic!
1871,Beric,Eddard,"Here to fight in   the Hands tourney, my lord?"
1872,Beric,Eddard,"Here to win the Hands tourney,"
1873,Eddard,Eddison,"Wine for the Kings Hand,I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease."
1874,Eddard,Renly,"If you are in need of new arms for the Hands tourney, you have come to the right shop."
1875,Eddard,Renly,"My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, my lord,You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you."
1876,Eddard,Renly,Any village smith can hammer out a shift of mail; my work is art.
1877,Eddard,Renly,"The direwolf was the sigil of House Stark, is it not?"
1878,Eddard,Eddison,Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?
1879,Eddard,Eddison,"The Hand did call upon me, with Lord Stannis, the kings brother.I regret to say, they did not honor me with their patronage."
1880,Eddard,Eddison,"They asked to see the boy,so I took them back to the forge.The boy,"
1881,Eddard,Eddison,I should like to see the boy as well.
1882,Eddard,Eddison,"As you wish, my lord,"
1883,Eddard,Robb,"This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King,"
1884,Eddard,Robb,This is Gendry.
1885,Eddard,Robb,"Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad."
1886,Eddard,Eddison,This is fine work.I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.
1887,Eddard,Eddison,Its not for sale.
1888,Eddard,Eddison,"Boy, this is the Kings Hand."
1889,Eddard,Eddison,"He honors you by asking.I made it for me,A hundred pardons, my lord,The boy is crude as new steel, and like new steel would profit from some beating."
1890,Eddard,Eddison,"Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen.Hes done nothing that requires my forgiveness.Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did you talk about?He asked me questions is all, mlord.What sort of questions?"
1891,Eddard,Eddison,"How was , and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my mother.Who she was and what she looked like and all.What did you tell him?"
1892,Eddard,Eddison,She died when I was little.
1893,Eddard,Eddison,She worked in an alehouse.Did Lord Stannis question you as well?The bald one?
1894,Eddard,Eddison,"He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done for his daughter.Mind your filthy tongue,This is the Kings own Hand."
1895,Eddard,Eddison,"A smart boy, but stubborn."
1896,Eddard,Eddison,"the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth."
1897,Eddard,Eddison,"Look at me, Gendry."
1898,Eddard,Eddison,"Go back to your work, lad.Im sorry to have bothered you."
1899,Eddard,Eddison,Who paid the boys apprentice fee?
1900,Eddard,Eddison,You saw the boy.
1901,Eddard,Eddison,"He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.The truth now,The streets are full of strong boys."
1902,Eddard,Eddison,"Who paid for him?A lord,He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat.He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.Describe him.He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you."
1903,Eddard,Jon,"He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear."
1904,Eddard,Jon,"My lord, I want no trouble.None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,You know who the boy is.I am only an armorer, my lord.I know what Im told.You know who the boy is,That is not a question.The boy is my apprentice,"
1905,Eddard,Jon,"Who he was before he came to me, thats none of my concern."
1906,Eddard,Jon,"If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me."
1907,Eddard,Jon,"Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place I visit."
1908,Eddard,Jon,"Did you find anything, my lord?"
1909,Eddard,Jon,"I did,"
1910,Bran,Osha, Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north.
1911,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I am soaked through,Even my bones are wet."
1912,Catelyn,Hoster,"We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve us both.There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,"
1913,Catelyn,Rodrik,"An inn,If only ."
1914,Catelyn,Rodrik,.
1915,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Riders,"
1916,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Mallisters,My lady, best pull up your hood."
1917,Jason,Rodrik,"He did not know you,He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired."
1918,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I think we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik."
1919,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Two rooms at the top of the stair, thats all there is,Theyre under the bell tower, you wont be missing meals, though theres some thinks it too noisy."
1920,Catelyn,Eddison,Its those rooms or the road.
1921,Catelyn,Eddison,"Leave your boots down here,The boy will clean them."
1922,Catelyn,Eddison,Those who come late to meals dont eat.
1923,Catelyn,Rodrik,"We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight, my lady.It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck,Common travelers attract less notice.A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business, say.As you say, my lady,"
1924,Catelyn,Rodrik,"The old courtesies die hard, my-my daughter."
1925,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Come, Father,Youll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I think, but try not to praise her.You truly dont want to see her smile."
1926,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,"
1927,Catelyn,Rodrik,"And to you, singer,"
1928,Catelyn,Rodrik,"We left Kings Landing a fortnight ago,Thats where Im bound,"
1929,Catelyn,Rodrik,"The Hands tourney means rich lords with fat purses.The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry ... or would have, if I hadnt lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.The gods frown on the gambler,"
1930,Catelyn,Rodrik,"They frowned on me, for certain,Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in.No doubt that was a lesson for you,It was.This time my coin will champion Ser Loras."
1931,Catelyn,Rodrik,"My name is Marillion,Doubtless youve heard me play somewhere?"
1932,Marillion,Rodrik,"I fear not,"
1933,Marillion,Rodrik,"That is your loss,Who was the finest singer youve ever heard?Alia of Braavos,Oh, Im much better than that old stick,If you have the silver for a song, Ill gladly show you.I might have a copper or two, but Id sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,"
1934,Catelyn,Marillion,"Your grandfather has a sour nature,I meant to do you honor."
1935,Catelyn,Marillion,"In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.Oh, I can see that,Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear.No doubt youve been to Riverrun.A hundred times,They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a brother."
1936,Edmure,Rodrik,And Winterfell?
1937,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Have you traveled north?Why would IT Marillion asked.Its all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves."
1938,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Innkeep,we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.Oh, gods,"
1939,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Im sorry, mlord, truly, were full up, every room."
1940,Catelyn,Tyrion,"My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I do not require a large room, as you can plainly see."
1941,Catelyn,Tyrion,"So long as the fires warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man."
1942,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Mlord, theres nothing, its the tourney, theres no help for it, oh ."
1943,Catelyn,Tyrion,.
1944,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Youre welcome to my room, mlord.Now theres a clever man,"
1945,Bran,Catelyn,And a nimble one to boot.
1946,Bran,Catelyn,"You will be able to manage food, I trust?Anything you like, mord, anything at all,"
1947,Bran,Catelyn,My men will have whatever youre serving these people.
1948,Catelyn,Marillion,"Yoren, will you sup with me?Aye, mord, I will,"
1949,Catelyn,Marillion,My lord of Lannister!
1950,Catelyn,Marillion,"I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat.Let me sing you the lay of your fathers great victory at Kings Landing!Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,"
1951,Catelyn,Marillion,"Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell."
1952,Catelyn,Rodrik,Lady .
1953,Catelyn,Rodrik,Stark?
1954,Catelyn,Rodrik,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,"
1955,Catelyn,Rodrik,"You in the corner,Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?"
1956,Catelyn,Rodrik,"It is, my lady.And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?She is,"
1957,Rodrik,Tyrion,"The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen."
1958,Rodrik,Tyrion,"Our lord is honored by his trust,I envy your father all these fine friends,but I do not quite see the purpose of this, Lady Stark."
1959,Catelyn,Tyrion,"I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey.How fares your good lord, sers?"
1960,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Lord Walder is well, my lady.He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence."
1961,Catelyn,Rodrik,"This man came a guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,"
1962,Rodrik,Tyrion,"In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the kings justice."
1963,Jaime,Sansa,"It is better than the songs,"
1964,Jeyne,Mordane,"His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm,"
1965,Harwin,Mordane,"Jory looks a beggar among these others,"
1966,Loras,Sansa,"Sweet lady,no victory is half so beautiful as you."
1967,Loras,Sansa,"You must be one of her daughters,"
1968,Mordane,Sansa,"You have the Tully look.Im Sansa Stark,"
1969,Mordane,Sansa,"I have not had the honor, my lord."
1970,Mordane,Sansa,"Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the kings small council.Your mother was my queen of beauty once,"
1971,Eddison,Mordane,You have her hair.
1972,Joffrey,Sansa,"Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.He was too kind,Ser Loras is a true knight.Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?No,My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime.And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all."
1973,Cersei,Sansa,"No, "
1974,Cersei,Sansa,"You do not tell me what to do, woman,I am king here, do you understand?I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!"
1975,Jaime,Renly,The great knight.
1976,Jaime,Renly,"Remember that, Kingslayer."
1977,Jaime,Renly,Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!
1978,Jaime,Renly,"As you say, Your Grace."
1979,Renly,Sansa,"Youve spilled your wine, Robert.Let me bring you a fresh goblet."
1980,Joffrey,Sansa,"It grows late,"
1981,Mordane,Sansa,"Do you need an escort back to the castle?No,"
1982,Joffrey,Mordane,I mean to say .
1983,Joffrey,Sandor,I should be glad for some protection.Dog!
1984,Joffrey,Sansa,"Yes, Your Grace?"
1985,Joffrey,Sansa,"Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls her,"
1986,Joffrey,Sansa,Did you think Joffrey was going to take you himself?
1987,Mordane,Sansa,Small chance of that.
1988,Mordane,Sansa,"Come, youre not the only one needs sleep.Ive drunk too much, and I may need to kill my brother tomorrow."
1989,Sandor,Sansa,"You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,"
1990,Sandor,Sansa,"Spare me your empty little compliments, girl ."
1991,Sandor,Sansa,"Did you see him ride today?Yes,He was "
1992,Sandor,Sansa,"No one could withstand him,"
1993,Sandor,Sansa,Some septa trained you well.
1994,Gregor,Sansa,"A pretty little talking -bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.Thats unkind."
1995,Gregor,Sansa,"Youre frightening me.I want to go now.No one could withstand him, Thats truth enough."
1996,Gregor,Sandor,Look at me!
1997,Gregor,Sandor,Theres a pretty for you.
1998,Gregor,Sandor,Take your look.
1999,Gregor,Sansa,"No pretty words for that, girl?No little compliment the septa taught you?"
2000,Gregor,Sansa,"Most of them, they think it was some battle."
2001,Gregor,Sansa,One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath.
2002,Gregor,Sansa,"Ill tell you what it was, girl,I was younger than you, six, maybe seven."
2003,Daenerys,Drogo,
2004,Gregor,Sansa,"Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, Arise, Ser Gregor. "
2005,Sandor,Sansa,"He was no true knight,"
2006,Sandor,Sansa,"No,no, little bird, he was no true knight."
2007,Sandor,Sansa,"Thank you, my lord,"
2008,Sandor,Sansa,"The things I told you tonight,If you ever tell Joffrey.... your sister, your father."
2009,Sandor,Sansa,".I wont,I promise."
2010,Sandor,Sansa,"If you ever tell anyone,Ill kill you."
2011,Barristan,Sansa,"I stood last vigil for him myself,He had no one else.A mother in the Vale, I am told."
2012,Eddard,Eddison,"Hugh was Jon Arryns squire for four years,The king knighted him before he rode north, in Jons memory.The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was not ready."
2013,Barristan,Eddard,"None of us is ever ready,For knighthood?For death."
2014,Barristan,Eddard,This was needless.War should not be a game.
2015,Barristan,Eddard,"Send his armor home to the Vale.The mother will want to have it.It is worth a fair piece of silver,The boy had it forged special for the tourney."
2016,Barristan,Eddard,"I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,Send the mother the armor."
2017,Bryce,Eddard,"NIlords,"
2018,Barristan,Meryn,"The king means to fight in the melee today,Yes,"
2019,Barristan,Small,"They say nights beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light.They say so,but not of Robert."
2020,Eddard,Robert,"Your Grace,its made too small, it wont go."
2021,Eddard,Robert,Seven hells!
2022,Eddard,Robert,Do I have to do it myself?
2023,Eddard,Robert,"Dont just stand there gaping, Lance], pick it up!"
2024,Eddard,Robert,"Look at these oafs, Eddard."
2025,Eddard,Robert,I say theyre swineherds dressed up in silk.
2026,Eddard,Robert,"The boys are not at fault,Youre too fat for your armor, Robert."
2027,Eddard,Robert,Is that how you speak to your king?
2028,Eddard,Robert,"Ah, damn you, Eddard, why are you always right?"
2029,Barristan,Robert,You.
2030,Barristan,Robert,What are you waiting for?
2031,Eddard,Robert,"Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagars face,I hope hell have the wit to send them to someone else.We ought to keep them running all day!Those boys,Lannisters?"
2032,Robert,Tywin,Cousins.
2033,Eddard,Tywin,"My wife comes from a very large family, Eddard."
2034,Eddard,Robert,The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night.
2035,Eddard,Robert,The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee.
2036,Eddard,Robert,"Your sister would never have shamed me like that.You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,You saw her beauty, but not the iron underneath.She would have told you that you have no business in the melee.You too?"
2037,Eddard,Robert,"You are a sour man, Stark."
2038,Eddard,Robert,"Well, mine are still running."
2039,Barristan,Eddard,"You are the king,I sit on the damn iron seat when I must."
2040,Barristan,Robert,"Seven hells, Eddard, I want to hit someone."
2041,Barristan,Robert,"Your Grace,"
2042,Barristan,Robert,Who would dare strike you?
2043,Eddard,Robert,"Why, all of them, damn it."
2044,Eddard,Robert,..
2045,Daenerys,Drogo,
2046,Eddard,Robert,Ser Barristan is right.Theres not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting YOU.
2047,Barristan,Eddard,"Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win?For a certainty,"
2048,Barristan,Eddard,"Get out,Get out before I kill you."
2049,Eddard,Robert,"Not you, Eddard."
2050,Eddard,Robert,"Drink,Ive no thirst-Diink."
2051,Jon,Robert,"Damn you, Eddard Stark."
2052,Jon,Robert,"You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.You had the better claim, Your Grace.I told you to drink, not to argue."
2053,Cersei,Eddard,"Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?Robert ."
2054,Cersei,Eddard,".Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking."
2055,Cersei,Jon,"Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his fathers throne."
2056,Cersei,Jon,"I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy."
2057,Cersei,Eddard,"Here, give me that beer if you wont drink it."
2058,Cersei,Eddard,"I am sorry for your girl, Eddard."
2059,Cersei,Eddard,"you love your children, dont you?With all my heart,Let me tell you a secret, Eddard."
2060,Cersei,Eddard,"How could I have made a son like that, Eddard?Hes only a boy,"
2061,Joffrey,Robert,"Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age?It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Eddard.You dont know him as I do."
2062,Eddard,Robert,"Ah, perhaps you are right.Jon despaired of me often enough, yet I grew into a good king."
2063,Eddard,Robert,"You might speak up and agree now, you know.Your Grace ."
2064,Eddard,Robert,.
2065,Eddard,Robert,"Ah, say that Im a better king than Aerys and be done with it."
2066,Cersei,Renly,.
2067,Jon,Robert,.
2068,Eddard,Robert,"He tossed one back at me, and before Jon could so much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction."
2069,Jaime,Petyr,"A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,"
2070,Petyr,Renly,"Done,Sandor has a hungry look about him this morning.Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them,"
2071,Petyr,Renly,"I wonder how I ought spend your money,"
2072,Petyr,Sansa,I knew the Hound would win.
2073,Eddard,Petyr,"If you know whos going to win the second match, speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean,"
2074,Eddard,Renly,"A pity the Imp is not here with us,I should have won twice as much."
2075,Daenerys,Drogo,
2076,Eddard,Sansa,"Father, dont let Ser Gregor hurt him,"
2077,Jory,Loras,"These are tourney lances,They make them to splinter on impact, so no one is hurt."
2078,Gregor,Loras,"My sword,"
2079,Eddard,Loras,Stop him!
2080,Gregor,Loras,"Leave him be, "
2081,Gregor,Sandor,"STOP THIS MADNESS, IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!"
2082,Barristan,Robert,"Let him go,Is the Hound the champion now?"
2083,Eddard,Sansa,"No,There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers."
2084,Daenerys,Drogo,I owe you my life.
2085,Petyr,Renly,"Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat,I swear the boy planned the whole thing.Gregor has always favored huge, ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense."
2086,Barristan,Renly,"There is small honor in tricks,Small honor and twenty thousand golds."
2087,Arya,Sansa,"The tournament was magnificent,You should have come.How was your dancing?Im sore all over,You must be a terrible dancer,Dance of the Dragons,I hope Forel is not being too hard on you,"
2088,Eddard,Syrio,"Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes you better."
2089,Eddard,Jory,"Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?"
2090,Eddard,Jory,Tomorrow were going to catch cats.Cats.
2091,Eddard,Jory,Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi.
2092,Arya,Barristan,"He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.I dont want them,I want Syrio."
2093,Arya,Sansa,"As you wish,"
2094,Arya,Sansa,"Try to be careful.I will,"
2095,Eddard,Harwin,"A man to see you, my lord,He will not give his name.Send him in,"
2096,Eddard,Harwin,Who are you?
2097,Eddard,Varys,"A friend,We must speak alone, Lord Stark."
2098,Eddard,Varys,"Harwin, leave us,"
2099,Eddard,Varys,Lord Varys?
2100,Eddard,Varys,"Lord Stark,I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink?"
2101,Eddard,Varys,"I might have passed within a foot of you and never recognized you,"
2102,Eddard,Varys,"That was my dearest hope,It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken in private."
2103,Cayn,Eddard,Thank you.How did you get past my other guards?
2104,Alyn,Varys,The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.
2105,Alyn,Varys,"I will not keep you long, my lord."
2106,Alyn,Varys,"You are the Kings Hand, and the king is a fool."
2107,Eddard,Varys,"Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonetheless ."
2108,Eddard,Varys,They had hoped to kill him during the melee.
2109,Eddard,Varys,Who?
2110,Eddard,Varys,"If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool than Robert and I am on the wrong side.The Lannisters,The queen ."
2111,Cersei,Eddard,"She asked him not to fight!She forbade him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the court."
2112,Eddard,Robert,I ask you.
2113,Robert,Varys,"Even if hed fought, who would have dared to strike the king?"
2114,Robert,Varys,There were forty riders in the melee.
2115,Robert,Varys,"Amidst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his, who could name it murder if some chance blow felled His Grace?"
2116,Robert,Varys,"After the deed was done, the slayer would be beside himself with grief."
2117,Eddard,Robert,Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him.
2118,Eddard,Robert,"Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head.Less risk for the Lannisters that way, though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend."
2119,Eddard,Robert,"You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.I command whisperers, not warriors.You might have come to me earlier.Oh, yes, I confess it."
2120,Eddard,Varys,I wonder.
2121,Eddard,Varys,"He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he did not fear   them."
2122,Eddard,Varys,"I will make another confession, Lord Eddard."
2123,Eddard,Varys,You did not trust me?
2124,Eddard,Varys,"The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves."
2125,Eddard,Varys,"and now I know, for a certainty."
2126,Eddard,Robert,"I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much.Oh, yes I do.You are the one she ought to fear,No."
2127,Eddard,Varys,"North or south, they sing no songs for spiders."
2128,Eddard,Varys,"But you, Lord Stark ."
2129,Eddard,Varys,"he would not kill you, not even for his queen, and there may lie our salvation."
2130,Jaime,Varys,"Surely Robert has other loyal friends,His brothers, his-"
2131,Jaime,Varys,"His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they?Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office, and Petyr loves Petyr.The Kingsguard-A paper shield,Try not to look so shocked, Lord Stark."
2132,Eddard,Meryn,"No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have.Robert must be told,If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it for himself.And what proof shall we lay before him?"
2133,Eddard,Ilyn,"I know where that road ends.Yet if what you say is true, they will only bide their time and make another attempt.Indeed they will,"
2134,Eddard,Ilyn,Thank you for the wine.
2135,Eddard,Jon,You should not find it difficult.Varys. 
2136,Eddard,Jon,"How did Jon Arryn die?I wondered when you would get around to that.Tell me.The tears of Lys, they call it."
2137,Eddard,Jon,"Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing, he told me."
2138,Eddard,Jon,"Who gave him the poison?Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt."
2139,Eddard,Jon,"Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting man."
2140,Eddard,Jon,There was one boy.
2141,Eddard,Jon,It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.
2142,Eddard,Jon,"He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, him in his bright new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak."
2143,Eddard,Jon,.
2144,Eddard,Jon,"The squire,Ser Hugh."
2145,Eddard,Jon,
2146,Jon,Varys,"What was he doing that they had to kill him?Asking questions,"
2147,Bronn,Tyrion,"None of us will go hungry tonight,"
2148,Bronn,Tyrion,"Some of us may,I am not fond of eating horse.Particularly my horse.Meat is meat,The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork.Do you take me for a Dothraki?"
2149,Chiggen,Tyrion,"Want a taste, dwarf?My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day,Thank him for us, then.If you ever see him again."
2150,Bronn,Tyrion,"Tastes well bred.Better if you fry it up with onions,"
2151,Bronn,Tyrion,"Damn her,damn her and all the Starks."
2152,Eddison,Tyrion,"No swords, not here, please, mlords."
2153,Eddison,Tyrion,"Where are your courtesies, Jyck?"
2154,Eddison,Tyrion,Do as she asks.
2155,Eddison,Tyrion,"Youre making a sad mistake, Lady Stark."
2156,Eddison,Tyrion, 
2157,Eddison,Tyrion,His dagger left these scars.The blade he sent to open my sons throat.
2158,Harren,Tyrion,"Kill him,"
2159,Harren,Tyrion,"If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it."
2160,Bronn,Catelyn,"Take their weapons,Good,excellent."
2161,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Dont kill him here!Dont kill him anywhere,Take him somewheres else, no blood here, mady, I wants no high lordlins quarrels.We are taking him back to Winterfell,"
2162,Tyrion,Tywin,"Winterfell it is, then,"
2163,Tyrion,Tywin,"My father will wonder what has become of me,Hell pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today."
2164,Rodrik,Tyrion,"His men come with him,And well thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what youve seen here."
2165,Catelyn,Tyrion,We must ride at once.
2166,Catelyn,Tyrion,"If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell, I promise you shall be well rewarded."
2167,Catelyn,Tyrion,"There is a great song to be made from this, and Im the one to make it,splendid adventure"
2168,Catelyn,Tyrion,"This is the high road,The eastem road.You said we were riding for Winterfell!"
2169,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Often and loudly,No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us.I wish them good speed."
2170,Catelyn,Willis,"We must have some rest, my lady,"
2171,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,This is the third horse we have lost-We will lose more than horses if were overtaken by the Lannisters,"
2172,Rodrik,Tyrion,"Small chance of that here,The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,"
2173,Marillion,Tyrion,"Let him speak,"
2174,Tyrion,Tywin,"By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck, chasing your lie up the kingsroad ."
2175,Tyrion,Tywin,"but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself."
2176,Tyrion,Tywin,"This is a cruel land, Lady Stark."
2177,Catelyn,Tyrion,"I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then whats the point?"
2178,Catelyn,Tyrion,"It might be said that your death is the point, Lannister,I think not,If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the word, and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile."
2179,Catelyn,Tyrion,"The Starks do not murder men in their beds.Nor do I,"
2180,Catelyn,Tyrion,"It was not my dagger,How many times must I swear to that?"
2181,Petyr,Tyrion,Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade.Why would Petyr lie to me?Why does a bear shit in the woods?
2182,Petyr,Tyrion,Because it is his nature.
2183,Petyr,Tyrion,"You ought to know that, you of all people."
2184,Catelyn,Tyrion,"And what does that mean, Lannister?"
2185,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my lady.That is a lie!"
2186,Catelyn,Marillion,"Oh, wicked little imp,"
2187,Catelyn,Marillion,"At your word, mlady, Ill toss his lying tongue at your feet."
2188,Catelyn,Tyrion,Petyr Baelish loved me once.
2189,Catelyn,Tyrion,"You are truly an evil man, Lannister.And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark.Petyr has never loved anyone but Petyr, and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, its those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs."
2190,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Shall I bleed him, my lady?Kill me and the truth dies with me,Let him talk,"
2191,Catelyn,Tyrion,"How did Petyr tell you I came by this dagger of his?Answer me that.You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffreys name day.When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?It was,"
2192,Rodrik,Tyrion,Riders!
2193,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, to horse,Get the other mounts behind us. "
2194,Catelyn,Tyrion,You will need every sword.
2195,Rodrik,Tyrion,I hear them!
2196,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess."
2197,Rodrik,Willis,they know were here.
2198,Marillion,Willis,"You, singer,Help me with this breastplate."
2199,Catelyn,Tyrion,"You have no choice,Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding us ."
2200,Catelyn,Tyrion,four men can be the difference between life and death up here.Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.My word?
2201,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Oh, that you have, my lady ."
2202,Catelyn,Tyrion,"on my honor as a Lannister.Arm them,"
2203,Bronn,Tyrion,I have never fought with an axe.
2204,Bronn,Chiggen,"Pretend youre splitting logs,"
2205,Marillion,Tyrion,"Logs dont bleed,"
2206,Marillion,Tyrion,Move over.Go away!
2207,Marillion,Tyrion,"Im a singer, I want no part of this fight!What, lost your taste for adventure?"
2208,Bronn,Rodrik,Winterfell!
2209,Tyrion,Willis,Harrenhal!Harrenhal!
2210,Chiggen,Tyrion,Casterly Rock!
2211,Marillion,Tyrion,"Someone help me,Gods have mercy, Im bleeding.I believe thats horse blood,"
2212,Marillion,Tyrion,"Close your eyes and pretend youre dead,"
2213,Bronn,Tywin,Your first battle?
2214,Bronn,Tyrion,"My father will be so proud,"
2215,Bronn,Chiggen,"You need a woman now,"
2216,Bronn,Chiggen,"Nothing like a woman after a mans been blooded, take my word."
2217,Rodrik,Tyrion,"Im willing if she is,"
2218,Tyrion,Willis,"Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,We drove them off for the moment, but they will not have gone far.We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,These were brave men.I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats.This soil is too stony for digging,Then we shall gather stones for cairns.Gather all the stones you want,"
2219,Chiggen,Rodrik,"breathing, for one."
2220,Chiggen,Rodrik,"Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,"
2221,Catelyn,Tyrion,"If we linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack."
2222,Catelyn,Tyrion,"May the gods forgive us, then.We will ride at once."
2223,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Ill take that dirk now, dwarf.Let him keep it."
2224,Catelyn,Tyrion,"And see that he has his axe back as well.We may have need of it if we are attacked again.You have my thanks, lady,Save them,I trust you no more than I did before."
2225,Marillion,Tyrion,"Craven, rhymes nicely with raven."
2226,Catelyn,Petyr,"As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,there is a serious flaw in Petyrs fable."
2227,Daenerys,Drogo,
2228,Arya,Syrio,Your enemies will give you more than scratches.
2229,Arya,Syrio,"Thats the real king of this castle right there,Older than sin and twice as mean."
2230,Robert,Tywin,"You stay away from that one, child."
2231,Arya,Myrcella,Whats he doing to that cat?
2232,Myrcella,Tommen,"What were you doing to that cat, boy?"
2233,Daenerys,Drogo,"Hes a ragged boy, isnt he?"
2234,Arya,Tommen,"A ragged dirty smelly boy,"
2235,Arya,Sansa,"Boy, how did you come here?You have no business in this part of the castle.You cant keep this sort out,Like trying to keep out rats.Who do you belong to, boy?"
2236,Arya,Tommen,"Answer me.Whats wrong with you, are you mute?"
2237,Myrcella,Tommen,"Godwyn, bring him here,"
2238,Arya,Tommen,"Oof, "
2239,Arya,Eddison,"Its dead,Its just a skull, it cant hurt me."
2240,Arya,Eddison,"ere there is a way in, there is a way out."
2241,Arya,Nan,"...found one bastard,The rest will come soon."
2242,Arya,Nan,".And when he learns the truth, what will he do?"
2243,Arya,Eddison,"The gods alone know,"
2244,Arya,Eddison,"The fools tried to kill his son, and whats worse, they made a mummers farce of it."
2245,Arya,Eddison,"I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each others throats, whether we will it or no.Too soon, too soon,What good is war now?"
2246,Arya,Eddison,Delay.As well bid me stop time.Do you take me for a wizard?
2247,Arya,Eddison,No less.
2248,Arya,Eddison,What would you have me do?
2249,Arya,Eddison,"If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
2250,Arya,Eddison,"You have danced the dance before, my friend."
2251,Arya,Eddison,"Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,"
2252,Arya,Eddison,"Perhaps so,Nonetheless, we must have time."
2253,Arya,Stannis,"You know how they are, these savages."
2254,Lysa,Stannis,"If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,This is no longer a game for two players, if ever it was."
2255,Arya,Jaime,"Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air forever.You are more than a juggler, old friend."
2256,Arya,Jaime,All I ask is that you work your magic awhile longer.
2257,Arya,Jaime,"What I can do, I will,I must have gold, and another fifty birds."
2258,Arya,Jaime,So many?
2259,Arya,Jaime,The ones you need are hard to find .
2260,Arya,Eddison,.No.
2261,Arya,Eddison,.
2262,Aegon,Arya,"Off with you,The kitchen scraps are gone, and well have no begging after dark. she said."
2263,Aegon,Arya,Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?I want to see my father.
2264,Arya,Harwin,"I want to fuck the queen myself, for all the good it does me,"
2265,Arya,Harwin,"Whos this father of yours, boy, the city ratcatcher?The Hand of the King,"
2266,Arya,Harwin,"Im not a boy,Im Arya Stark of Winterfell, and if you lay a hand on me my lord father will have both your heads on spikes.If you dont believe me, fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the Tower of the Hand."
2267,Arya,Harwin,"Now are you going to open the gate, or do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?"
2268,Eddard,Harwin,You realize I had half my guard out searching for you?
2269,Eddard,Harwin,Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear.
2270,Eddard,Harwin,"Arya, you know you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my leave.I didnt go out the gates,Well, I didnt mean to."
2271,Arya,Eddard,"Jons the bastard, I bet.Jon?"
2272,Arya,Eddard,"Who said this?They did,There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard, and another in mail and a steel cap, and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one told him he couldnt keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other and it was a mummers farce."
2273,Eddard,Nan,The fat one said the princess was with child.
2274,Eddard,Nan,"I think he was a wizard.A wizard,Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with stars?No!"
2275,Eddard,Nan,"He didnt look like a wizard, but the fat one said he was.I warn you, Arya, if youre spinning this thread of air-"
2276,Nan,Tommen,.
2277,Nan,Tommen,.
2278,Nan,Tommen,"Thats where I found the monsters.Monsters and wizards,It would seem youve had quite an adventure.These men you heard, you say they spoke of juggling and mummery?Yes,only-Arya, they were mummers,There must be a dozen troupes in Kings Landing right now, come to make some coin off the tourney crowds.Im not certain what these two were doing in the castle, but perhaps the king has asked for a show.No."
2279,Syrio,Tommen,They werent-
2280,Daenerys,Drogo," He was interrupted by a short, sudden knock. Desmond called out, opening the door a crack, "
2281,Desmond,Syrio,"I thought you would want to know.My door is always open to the Nights Watch,"
2282,Arya,Desmond,"Yoren, as it please mord.My pardons for the hour."
2283,Arya,Jon,"And this must be your son.He has your look.Im a girl,"
2284,Arya,Jon,Do you know my brothers?
2285,Arya,Jon,"Robb and Bran are at Winterfell, and Jons on the Wall."
2286,Arya,Jon,Im Arya Stark.
2287,Arya,Jon,"When you ride back to the Wall, would you bring Jon a letter if I wrote one?"
2288,Eddard,Jon,"My daughter often forgets her courtesies,I beg your forgiveness, Yoren.Did my brother Benjen send you?No one sent me, mord, saving old Mormont."
2289,Benjen,Yoren,"Rode hard, I did, near killed my horse the way I drove her, but I left the others well behind.The others?"
2290,Benjen,Yoren,Sellswords and freeriders and like trash.
2291,Arya,Yoren,"Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now, you can count on it."
2292,Arya,Yoren,What word is this?
2293,Arya,Yoren,"One best spoken in private, mord, begging your pardons.As you say.Desmond, see my daughter to her chambers."
2294,Arya,Yoren,Well finish our talk on the morrow.
2295,Arya,Yoren,"Nothing bads happened to Jon, has it?"
2296,Arya,Yoren,"Or Uncle Benjen?Well, as to Stark, I cant say."
2297,Arya,Desmond,Its not them as concerns me.
2298,Arya,Desmond,"Come along, milady.You heard your lord father."
2299,Desmond,Yoren,How many guards does my father have?
2300,Desmond,Eddard,"Here at Kings Landing?Fifty.You wouldnt let anyone kill him, would you?"
2301,Desmond,Eddard,"No fear on that count, little lady."
2302,Arya,Eddard,"Hell come to no harm.The Lannisters have more than fifty men,So they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so you can sleep easy.What if a wizard was sent to kill him?Well, as to that,wizards die the same as other men, once you cut their heads off."
2303,Arya,Eddard,"Robert, I beg of you,hear what you are saying."
2304,Arya,Viserys,"I warned you this would happen, Eddard."
2305,Eddard,Viserys,I want them dead.
2306,Eddard,Varys,"You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done.I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck.There is no axe,Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty years removed ."
2307,Eddard,Varys,if it exists at all.If?
2308,Eddard,Varys,"My lord, you wrong me.Would I bring ties to king and council?"
2309,Eddard,Varys,"You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away, my lord."
2310,Eddard,Varys,"Perhaps he is lying.Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me,Rely on it, my lord.The princess is with child.So you say."
2311,Eddard,Robert,"If the babe dies in infancy, we need not fear.But if it is a boy?"
2312,Eddard,Robert,If he lives?The narrow sea would still lie between us.I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
2313,Eddard,Varys,"So you would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my shores, is that it?This dragonspawn is in his mothers belly,Even Aegon did no conquering until after he was weaned.Gods!You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark."
2314,Eddard,Varys,Have the rest of you mislaid your tongues?Will no one talk sense to this frozen-faced fool?
2315,Eddard,Varys,"I understand your qualms, Lord Eddard, truly I do."
2316,Eddard,Renly,"Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, howevermuch it pains us."
2317,Eddard,Renly,"The matter seems simple enough to me.We ought to have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn.Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Roberts friends and mine.When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your brother said, I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well, and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristans wounds."
2318,Eddard,Robert,Would that man were here today.
2319,Eddard,Robert,"It was not the same,Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard.Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl."
2320,Eddard,Robert,"Robert, I ask you, what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of children?To put an end to Targaryens!"
2321,Eddard,Robert,"Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar."
2322,Eddard,Robert,Have the years so unmanned you that you tremble at the shadow of an unborn child?
2323,Eddard,Robert,"No more, Eddard,Not another word.Have you forgotten who is king here?No, Your Grace,Have you?Enough!"
2324,Eddard,Renly,I am sick of talk.
2325,Renly,Varys,"What say you all?She must be killed,We have no choice,Sadly, sadly Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said, Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard."
2326,Aerys,Robert,"My order serves the realm, not the ruler."
2327,Petyr,Varys,How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear?
2328,Petyr,Varys,"Is it not wiser, even kinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live?Kinder,Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester."
2329,Petyr,Varys,"Should the gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed."
2330,Barristan,Petyr,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it,Waiting wont make the maid any prettier.Kiss her and be done with it.Kiss her?"
2331,Petyr,Robert,"A steel kiss,"
2332,Petyr,Robert,"Well, there it is, Eddard."
2333,Renly,Robert,"The only question that remains is, who can we find to kill her?Mormont craves a royal pardon,Desperately,"
2334,Pycelle,Renly,"If I told you what the Dothraki would do to the poor man who used   one on a khaleesi, none of you would sleep tonight."
2335,Eddard,Pycelle,"Now, poison ."
2336,Eddard,Pycelle,Khal Drogo need never know it was not a natural death.
2337,Eddard,Pycelle,"Poison is a cowards weapon,"
2338,Eddard,Pycelle,You send hired knives to kill a fourteenyear-old girl and still quibble about honor?
2339,Eddard,Pycelle,"Do it yourself, Robert."
2340,Eddard,Robert,"You owe her that much at least.Gods,You mean it, damn you."
2341,Eddard,Robert,I am out of wine and out of patience.
2342,Eddard,Robert,"Just have it done.I will not be part of murder, Robert.Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to it."
2343,Eddard,Robert,"You are the Kings Hand, Lord Stark.You will do as I command you, or Ill find me a Hand who will.I wish him every success."
2344,Eddard,Robert,"I thought you a better man than this, Robert.I thought we had made a nobler king."
2345,Eddard,Robert,"Out, Out, damn you, Im done with you."
2346,Eddard,Robert,"And make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, Ill have your head on a spike!"
2347,Petyr,Pycelle,"On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men,Do you have any idea how costly they are?"
2348,Petyr,Pycelle,"You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and thats for a merchant.I dont dare think what they might ask for a princess."
2349,Eddard,Vayon,"You sent for me, my lord Hand?Hand no longer,The king and I have quarreled.We shall be returning to Winterfell.I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord.We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey.We may not have a fortnight."
2350,Eddard,Robert,The king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike.
2351,Jory,Tyrion,"It might be safest if I went on ahead,I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen."
2352,Eddard,Jory,"The castle is full of eyes and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known.As you command, my lord."
2353,Tomard,Vayon,"Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain,I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe.I wish to leave at once."
2354,Eddard,Tomard,"Lord Baelish to see you, mlord."
2355,Eddard,Petyr,"Show him in, Tom."
2356,Eddard,Lamprey,"Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?I wont detain you long, Im on my way to dine with Lady Tanda."
2357,Eddard,Varys,"I do love lamprey pie.Dont let me keep you from your eels, my lord,At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.Oh, Im certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few names."
2358,Eddard,Petyr,"The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently, I seem to recall."
2359,Eddard,Petyr,"After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men,Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that well make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl."
2360,Eddard,Petyr,So now we grant titles to assassins.
2361,Eddard,Petyr,Titles are cheap.
2362,Eddard,Petyr,"If wed sent a Faceless Man after her, shed be as good as buried."
2363,Eddard,Petyr,"You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl?How big a fool do you take me for?Well, quite an enormous one, actually,Do you always find murder so amusing, Lord Baelish?Its not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, its you."
2364,Eddard,Petyr,"I believe I heard the first crack this morning.The first and last,Ive had my fill.When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?As soon as I can.What concern is that of yours?None ."
2365,Eddard,Petyr,"but if perchance youre still here come evenfall, Id be pleased to take you to this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually."
2366,Eddard,Petyr,And I wont even tell the Lady Catelyn.
2367,Catelyn,Petyr,"My lady, you should have sent word of your coming,We would have sent an escort.The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a party as small as yours.We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel,"
2368,Bronn,Catelyn,The clansmen harried us day and night.
2369,Bronn,Catelyn,"When we heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain."
2370,Bronn,Catelyn,"The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,"
2371,Bronn,Catelyn,"If it were up to me, I would take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden it."
2372,Bronn,Catelyn,"Shadows, some say."
2373,Bronn,Catelyn,"I hope I have not spoken out of turn, my lady.I meant no offense.Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel."
2374,Bran,Jon,"When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once.Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds."
2375,Catelyn,Marillion,"The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded.He can see to your mans hurts."
2376,Brynden,Catelyn,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
2377,Brynden,Catelyn,"Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,"
2378,Brynden,Catelyn,"I thought the lady looked familiar.You are far from home, little Cat.And you, Uncle,"
2379,Brynden,Catelyn,"My home is at my back,Your home is in my heart,Take off your helm.I would look on your face again.The years have not improved it, I fear,"
2380,Brynden,Catelyn,"Did Lysa know you were coming?There was no time to send word ahead,"
2381,Brynden,Catelyn,"I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.May we enter the Vale?"
2382,Brynden,Catelyn,"In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,Come."
2383,Catelyn,Eddard,"Its there, beside Alyssas Tears.All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right."
2384,Eddard,Rodrik,How long a ride?
2385,Catelyn,Rodrik,"We can be at the mountain by evenfall,but the climb will take another day."
2386,Catelyn,Rodrik,"My lady,I fear I can go no farther today."
2387,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Nor should you,You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred times more."
2388,Bronn,Rodrik,"Lannister must come with me, but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength.We should be honored to have them to guest,"
2389,Marillion,Willis,"My lady,I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings."
2390,Bronn,Catelyn,"Very well,Ill come as well,"
2391,Bronn,Willis,"As you wish,"
2392,Daenerys,Drogo,"So, child."
2393,Brynden,Hoster,the black goat of the Tully flock.
2394,Catelyn,Eddard,"Your father must be told,If the Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path.Id had the same fear,I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach the Eyrie."
2395,Brynden,Lysa,What is the mood in the Vale?
2396,Brynden,Lysa,"Angry,Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years."
2397,Catelyn,Lysa,"None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but suspicion casts a long shadow."
2398,Catelyn,Jon,And there is the boy.The boy?What of him?
2399,Jon,Nestor,"Lord Robert,Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away."
2400,Catelyn,Small,"The Eyrie is full of them.I might have expected that,"
2401,Lysa,Nestor,"Will Lysa take another husband?She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men."
2402,Brynden,Lysa,"Nor do , but ."
2403,Catelyn,Lysa,"She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.A woman can rule as wisely as a man,The tight woman can,Make no mistake, Cat.Lysa is not you."
2404,Catelyn,Lysa,"If truth be told, I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like."
2405,Catelyn,Lysa,What do you mean?The Lysa who came back from Kings Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand.
2406,Catelyn,Lysa,"Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from politics, not passion.As was my own.They began the same, but your ending has been happier than your sisters."
2407,Catelyn,Tyrion,"and now you have brought the lion to her door.In chains,"
2408,Catelyn,Tyrion,Oh?
2409,Catelyn,Tyrion,"I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow.Where are the chains, sweet one?"
2410,Catelyn,Lysa,"The dwarf is here, and not by choice."
2411,Brynden,Lysa,"It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them."
2412,Brynden,Lysa,"I hope you are right, child,"
2413,Catelyn,Eddison,"The Gates of the Moon,"
2414,Catelyn,Eddison,Lord Nestors seat.
2415,Catelyn,Eddison,Look up.
2416,Marillion,Tyrion,"The Eyrie,"
2417,Brynden,Tyrion,"The Arryns must not be overfond of company.If youre   planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark, Id rather you kill me here.Well spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,I can scarcely wait,How do we get up there?Ive no experience at riding goats.Mules,There are steps carved into the mountain,"
2418,Jon,Robert,"It is too dark to see them, but the steps are there."
2419,Brynden,Tyrion,The mules will take us as far up as Sky.
2420,Brynden,Tyrion,And beyond that?
2421,Brynden,Tyrion,"Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules."
2422,Catelyn,Tyrion,"If you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples."
2423,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Would that I were a pumpkin,Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips."
2424,Catelyn,Tyrion,We Lannisters do have a certain pride.Pride?
2425,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Arrogance, some might call it.Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.My brother is undoubtedly arrogant,My father is the soul of avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath."
2426,Catelyn,Tyrion,Shall I bleat for you?
2427,Catelyn,Moon,"Lady Stark,"
2428,Catelyn,Yohn,"Lord Nestor,"
2429,Lysa,Yohn,"We have had a long and tiring journey.I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.My roof is yours, my lady,"
2430,Brynden,Lysa,The rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light.
2431,Brynden,Lysa,What madness is this?
2432,Brynden,Nestor,"A night ascent, with the moon not even full?Even Lysa should know thats an invitation to a broken neck.The mules know the way, Ser Brynden."
2433,Catelyn,Nestor,"I promise you, my lady, no harm will come to you."
2434,Catelyn,Nestor,Mychel says my father must have been a goat.
2435,Catelyn,Nestor,"Do you have a name, child?Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,"
2436,Catelyn,Nestor,"Myas a clever girl, and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe her.She has not failed me yet.Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,Lord Nestor, I charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner.And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before he dies of hunger,A girl would be pleasant as well, but I suppose thats too much to ask of you."
2437,Catelyn,Nestor,"As you say, my lady, so it will be done."
2438,Catelyn,Tyrion,"See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring him meat and mead."
2439,Catelyn,Mya,"Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,When they get frightened or dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight.They dont like that.I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,I do not frighten easily.Do you plan to light a torch?"
2440,Catelyn,Mya,Torches just blind you.
2441,Catelyn,Mya,Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl.
2442,Catelyn,Mya,"You mentioned Mychel before,"
2443,Mya,Sansa,"Mychels my love,Mychel Redfort."
2444,Mya,Sansa,"Were to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after."
2445,Catelyn,Mya,"Stone,"
2446,Catelyn,Mya,"You dont want your mule to break a leg up here,"
2447,Catelyn,Mya,"We ought to keep going, my lady,If it please you."
2448,Catelyn,Mya,"Whiteys a good one, my lady."
2449,Catelyn,Mya,Hell kick if he doesnt like you.
2450,Catelyn,Mya,"My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began,It was always white above here, and the ice never melted."
2451,Catelyn,Mya,"I cant remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the olden times."
2452,Catelyn,Mya,"Its best to lead the mules over,The wind can be a little scary here, my lady."
2453,Catelyn,Mya,"Lady Stark,"
2454,Catelyn,Mya,Are you well?
2455,Catelyn,Mya,I .
2456,Daenerys,Drogo, she called out. the bastard girl said.
2457,Catelyn,Mya,"Ill come back for you,Dont move, my lady."
2458,Catelyn,Mya,Keep your eyes closed if you like.
2459,Catelyn,Mya,Yes.
2460,Catelyn,Mya,"The stables and barracks are in there,The last part is inside the mountain."
2461,Catelyn,Mya,Another hour and well be there.
2462,Catelyn,Vardis,"The Lannisters may have their pride,"
2463,Catelyn,Vardis,I shall ride with the turnips.
2464,Catelyn,Colemon,"Lady Stark,the pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated."
2465,Catelyn,Colemon,"Indeed it is, my lady, indeed it is."
2466,Catelyn,Colemon,"She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.I hope she had a good nights rest,"
2467,Catelyn,Lysa,"Cat,Oh, Cat, how good it is to see you.My sweet sister."
2468,Catelyn,Lysa,"How long it has been,Oh, how very very long."
2469,Colemon,Vardis,"You look well,"
2470,Colemon,Vardis,tired.
2471,Colemon,Vardis,Tired.
2472,Colemon,Vardis,"Oh, yes."
2473,Colemon,Vardis,"Leave us,I wish to speak to my sister alone."
2474,Catelyn,Lysa,Have you taken leave of your senses?
2475,Catelyn,Lysa,"To bring him here, without a word of permission, without so much as a warning, to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannisters ."
2476,Catelyn,Lysa,.My quarrels?
2477,Lysa,Robert,"They were your quarrels first, sister.It was you who sent me that cursed letter, you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband.To warn you, so you could stay away from them!"
2478,Lysa,Robert,"Gods, Cat, do you know what youve done?Mother?"
2479,Catelyn,Small,I heard voices.
2480,Catelyn,Lysa,"This is your aunt Catelyn, baby."
2481,Catelyn,Lysa,Do you remember?
2482,Catelyn,Lysa,"I think so,Come to Mother, my sweet one."
2483,Jon,Lysa,Isnt he beautiful?
2484,Lysa,Robert,"He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.Lysa,if youre right about the Lannisters, all the more reason we must act quickly.We-Not in front of the baby,He has a delicate temper, dont you, sweet one?The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,and these are no times   for delicacy."
2485,Lysa,Robert,Youre scaring the boy.
2486,Catelyn,Lysa,"Dont be afraid, my sweet baby,Mothers here, nothing will hurt you."
2487,Catelyn,Lysa,"Were safe here,"
2488,Catelyn,Lysa,"Dont be a fool,No one is safe.If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken."
2489,Catelyn,Lysa,"Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable."
2490,Brynden,Catelyn,No enemy could ever reach us up here.
2491,Brynden,Lysa,"No castle is impregnable.This one is,Everyone says so.The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me?Is he a bad man?"
2492,Lysa,Robert,"A very bad man,but Mother wont let him harm my little baby.Make him fly,"
2493,Lysa,Robert,"Perhaps we will,Perhaps that is just what we will do."
2494,Eddard,Heward,Its time we took our leave.My business here is done.
2495,Jory,Petyr,"As you will, my lord,Ill help Wyl bring round the horses."
2496,Eddard,Robert,"Your business,"
2497,Eddard,Robert,"  Eddard interrupted, "
2498,Eddard,Petyr,"And I am no longer the Kings Hand.The direwolf must be a prickly beast,"
2499,Eddard,Jory,"Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?"
2500,Jory,Petyr,"Chataya runs a choice establishment,Ive half a mind to buy it."
2501,Eddard,Petyr,"Whores seldom sink, and when they are boarded by pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like everyone else."
2502,Eddard,Lyanna,"Robert will never keep to one bed,I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale."
2503,Eddard,Lyanna,"Love is sweet, dearest Eddard, but it cannot change a mans nature."
2504,Eddard,Robert,"I named her Barra,She looks so like him, does she not, milord?"
2505,Eddard,Robert,.She does.
2506,Eddard,Robert,"Tell him that when you see him, milord, as it ... as it please you.Tell him how beautiful she is.I will,"
2507,Eddard,Lyanna,And tell him Ive not been with no one else.
2508,Eddard,Jon,"He was always good to me, truly."
2509,Eddard,Jon,"I will tell him, child, and I promise you, Barra shall not go wanting."
2510,Jon,Petyr,"Lord Baelish, what do you know of Roberts bastards?Well, he has more than you, for a start.How many?"
2511,Petyr,Stannis,Does it matter?
2512,Eddard,Stannis,"Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wifes House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly."
2513,Cersei,Eddard,"Ive also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock, three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywins tourney."
2514,Cersei,Eddard,"Too much an affront to Lannister pride, that close to home."
2515,Eddard,Robert,Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the kings baseborn children?
2516,Eddard,Petyr,He was the Kings Hand.Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for.
2517,Eddard,Petyr,"It had to be more than that, or why kill him?"
2518,Eddard,Petyr,Now I see.
2519,Eddard,Small,"Allow a man like that to live, and next hes like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east."
2520,Eddard,Jory,"My lord, "
2521,Jory,Wyl,Behind!
2522,Eddard,Jory,"Make way or die!The wolves are howling,"
2523,Eddard,Petyr,"Such a small pack, though."
2524,Eddard,Petyr,What is the meaning of this?This is the Hand of the King.He was the Hand of the King.
2525,Eddard,Petyr,"Now, if truth be told, Im not sure what he is.Lannister, this is madness,Let us pass."
2526,Eddard,Jaime,"What do you think youre doing?He knows what hes doing,"
2527,Eddard,Jaime,Quite true.
2528,Eddard,Petyr,"A short man.I remember him well,It would seem he has met some trouble on the road."
2529,Eddard,Petyr,"You would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill, would you?Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes,"
2530,Jaime,Petyr,"My lords-Show me your steel,   Lord Eddard.Ill butcher you like Aerys if I must, but Id sooner you died with a blade in your hand."
2531,Eddard,Petyr,"Lord Baelish, Id leave here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing."
2532,Eddard,Petyr,"I will bring the City Watch,"
2533,Eddard,Jaime,"Kill me,and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion."
2534,Catelyn,Eddard,Would she?
2535,Catelyn,Jaime,not.
2536,Catelyn,Jaime,But I am not willing to chance my brothers life on a womans honor.
2537,Catelyn,Jaime,So I suppose Ill let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you.I wonder if hell care.
2538,Eddard,Jaime,"Tregar, see that no harm comes to Lord Stark.As you say, mlord.Still ."
2539,Eddard,Jaime,"-through the night and the rain, he glimpsed the white of Jaimes smile-"
2540,Eddard,Jory,No!
2541,Eddard,Jory,"Jory, away!"
2542,Daenerys,Drogo,
2543,Eddard,Pycelle,"The milk of the poppy, for your pain."
2544,Drogo,Viserys,Where is the city?
2545,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ahead,Under the mountain."
2546,Jorah,Viserys,"So many,and from so many lands."
2547,Jorah,Viserys,"The trash of dead cities,"
2548,Daenerys,Viserys,All these savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built .
2549,Daenerys,Viserys,and kill.
2550,Daenerys,Viserys,"They do know how to kill.Otherwise Id have no use for them at all.They are my people now,You should not call them savages, brother.The dragon speaks as he likes,"
2551,Rakharo,Viserys,"See, the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men."
2552,Rakharo,Viserys,How long must we linger amidst these ruins before Drogo gives me my army?I grow tired of waiting.The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen .
2553,Rakharo,Viserys,".The crones, yes,"
2554,Jorah,Viserys,Im tired of eating horsemeat and Im sick of the stink of these savages.
2555,Daenerys,Drogo,
2556,Jorah,Viserys,"The khal will honor his promise in his own time.He had better,I was promised a crown, and I mean to have it.The dragon is not mocked."
2557,Daenerys,Jorah,"I pray that my sun-andstars will not keep him waiting too long,"
2558,Jorah,Viserys,Your brother should have bided his time in Pentos.
2559,Jorah,Viserys,Illyrio tried to warn him.He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand.My lord husband promised a golden crown.
2560,Jorah,Viserys,"Yes, Khaleesi, but ."
2561,Daenerys,Viserys,"You do not demand a gift, not of a khaL You do not demand anything of a khal.It is not right to make him wait."
2562,Daenerys,Jorah,Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers.
2563,Daenerys,Jorah,Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms.
2564,Daenerys,Jorah,What .
2565,Daenerys,Jorah,what if it were not Viserys?
2566,Daenerys,Jorah,If it were someone else who led them?
2567,Daenerys,Jorah,Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
2568,Daenerys,Jorah,"When I first went into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as their horses.If you had asked me then, Princess, I should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki.But if I asked you now?Now,"
2569,Jorah,Robert,"Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar.Is that truly so many?Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident,"
2570,Daenerys,Robert,"How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?Not long,not well."
2571,Daenerys,Robert,"Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that."
2572,Daenerys,Jorah,.Is he?
2573,Daenerys,Jorah,"A fool, I mean?"
2574,Daenerys,Jorah,"Robert should have been born Dothraki,Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand."
2575,Daenerys,Eddard,"You hate this Lord Stark,He took from me all I loved, for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious honor,"
2576,Drogo,Jorah,"There,Vaes Dothrak.The city of the horselords."
2577,Daenerys,Jorah,"None of them are alike,Your brother had part of the truth,The Dothraki do not build."
2578,Daenerys,Jorah,"The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands theyve plundered, and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples."
2579,Daenerys,Jorah,Where are the people who live here?
2580,Daenerys,Drogo,"Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and their slaves and servants,yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar, should all the khals return to the Mother at once."
2581,Illyrio,Mag,palace
2582,Drogo,Jhiqui,"Blood of my blood,"
2583,Cohollo,Daenerys,"Khaleesi, Drogo, who is blood of my blood, commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night, to sacrifice to the gods for his safe return."
2584,Cohollo,Daenerys,"Tell my sun-and-stars that I dream of him, and wait anxious for his return,"
2585,Doreah,Drogo,"Jhiqui, a bath, please,"
2586,Jhiqui,Viserys,"I will give my brother his gifts tonight,He should look a king in the sacred city.Doreah, run and find him and invite him to sup with me."
2587,Illyrio,Irri,"Irri, go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat.Anything but horseflesh.Horse is best,Horse makes a man strong.Viserys hates horsemeat.As you say, Khaleesi. "
2588,Doreah,Viserys,"How dare you send this whore to give me commands,"
2589,Daenerys,Viserys,"I only wanted ... Doreah, what did you say?Khaleesi, pardons, forgive me.I went to him, as you bid, and told him you commanded him to join you for supper.No one commands the dragon,I am your king!I should have sent you back her head!"
2590,Daenerys,Viserys,"Dont be afraid, he wont hurt you.Sweet brother, please, forgive her, the girl misspoke herself, I told her to ask you to sup with me, if it pleases Your Grace."
2591,Daenerys,Viserys,Look.These are for you.
2592,Daenerys,Viserys,What is all this?New raiment.I had it made for you.
2593,Daenerys,Viserys,Dothraki rags.Do you presume to dress me now?Please .
2594,Daenerys,Viserys,Next youll want to braid my hair.Id never .
2595,Daenerys,Viserys,.
2596,Daenerys,Viserys,"You have no right to a braid, you have won no victories yet."
2597,Daenerys,Viserys,"This stinks of manure.Perhaps I shall use it as a horse blanket.I had Doreah sew it specially for you,These are garments fit for a khaL I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with bells in his hair,"
2598,Daenerys,Viserys,"You forget yourself, slut.Do you think that big belly will protect you if you wake the dragon?"
2599,Daenerys,Viserys,"You are the one who forgets himself,Didnt you learn anything that day in the grass?"
2600,Daenerys,Viserys,"And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of this, or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails."
2601,Daenerys,Viserys,"When I come into my kingdom, you will rue this day, slut."
2602,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Your supper is ready, Khaleesi,Im not hungry,"
2603,Daenerys,Irri,"Share the food among yourselves, and send some to Ser Jorah, if you would.Please, bring me one of the dragons eggs."
2604,Bran,Daenerys,"You are the dragon,"
2605,Bran,Eddison,I know it.
2606,Bran,Robb,Are you ready?
2607,Bran,Robb,"Lets ride, then."
2608,Bran,Robb,"Go,"
2609,Robb,Theon,"Sweet Kyra,She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she blushes pink as a maid. "
2610,Bran,Robb,"You are doing well, Bran.I want to go faster,"
2611,Bran,Robb,As you will.
2612,Bran,Robb,I can tide!
2613,Bran,Robb,"Id race you, but I fear youd win."
2614,Bran,Robb,I dont want to race.
2615,Bran,Robb,"Did you hear Summer howling last night?Grey Wind was restless too,"
2616,Bran,Robb,Sometimes I think they know things .
2617,Bran,Robb,.
2618,Bran,Robb,"I never know how much to tell you, Bran.I wish you were older.Im eight now!"
2619,Bran,Robb,"Eight isnt so much younger than fifteen, and Im the heir to Winterfell, after you.So you are."
2620,Bran,Robb,"Bran, I need to tell you something."
2621,Bran,Nan,Maester Luwin woke me.
2622,Bran,Jory,Was the bird from Mother?Is she coming home?The message was from Alyn in Kings Landing.
2623,Heward,Robb,Murdered by the Kingslayer.
2624,Bran,Jory,May the gods give them rest.
2625,Bran,Jory,They killed Jory?
2626,Bran,Robb,Why would anyone kill Jory?
2627,Bran,Robb,"I dont know, and ."
2628,Pycelle,Theon,.
2629,Robb,Theon,"When he will wake,"
2630,Bran,Robb,"Bran, I promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this be forgotten."
2631,Bran,Theon,What will you do?
2632,Robb,Theon,"Theon thinks I should call the banners,Blood for blood."
2633,Bran,Robb,"Only the lord can call the banners,If your father dies,Robb will be Lord of Winterfell.He wont die!"
2634,Bran,Robb,"He wont die, not Father,Still ... the honor of the north is in my hands now."
2635,Bran,Rickon,"Im almost a man grown, Bran."
2636,Bran,Rickon,"I wish Mother was back,"
2637,Bran,Theon,"Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners   too?The maester is timid as an old woman,Father always listened to his counsel,Mother too.I listen to him,I listen to everyone."
2638,Luwin,Robb,Can we go back now?
2639,Luwin,Robb,Im cold.
2640,Luwin,Robb,We need to find the wolves.Can you stand to go a bit longer?I can go as long as you can.
2641,Robb,Theon,"Lets hunt down the hunters, then,"
2642,Bran,Robb,Bran?
2643,Bran,Robb,Whats wrong?
2644,Bran,Robb,"I was just remembering,Jory brought us here once, to fish for trout."
2645,Jon,Robb,"Do you remember?I remember,I didnt catch anything,but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell. Robb pointed out."
2646,Bran,Robb,"Summer,"
2647,Bran,Robb,"Theyve made a kill,Id best go and bring them back.Wait here, Theon and the others should be along shortly.I want to go with you,Ill find them faster by myself."
2648,Bran,Luwin,"Good day to you,"
2649,Bran,Eddison,"All alone, are you?"
2650,Bran,Eddison,"Lost in the wolfswood, poor lad.Im not lost."
2651,Bran,Eddison,"My brother rode off just a moment ago, and my guard will be here shortly.Your guard, is it?"
2652,Bran,Eddison,"And what would they be guarding, my little lord?Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak?Pretty,"
2653,Bran,Eddison,"Lets have a look,"
2654,Eddard,Robb,"The pin, lad,"
2655,Eddard,Robb,"Well take the horse too,Get down, and be quick about it."
2656,Bran,Stiv,"No,I cant The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off.You can, lordling ."
2657,Bran,Stiv,"and will, if you know whats good for you.Stiv, look how hes strapped on."
2658,Bran,Stiv,"Might be its the truth hes telling.Straps, is it?"
2659,Bran,Stiv,Theres ways to deal with straps.You some kind of cripple?
2660,Bran,Stiv,"Im Brandon Stark of Winterfell, and you better let go of my horse, or Ill see you all dead."
2661,Bran,Stiv,"The boys a Stark, true enough.Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth,That should shut him up.Youre as stupid as you are ugly, Hali,The boys worth nothing dead, but alive ."
2662,Bran,Stiv,"gods be damned, think what Mance would give to have Benjen Starks own blood to hostage!Mance be damned,You want to go back there, Osha?"
2663,Bran,Stiv,Think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage?
2664,Bran,Robb,"Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death,"
2665,Osha,Robb,"The brother,Hes a fierce one, he is,"
2666,Osha,Robb,"You mean to fight us, boy?Dont be a fool, lad.Youre one against six."
2667,Osha,Robb,"Off the horse, and throw down the sword.Well thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison, and you and your brother can be on your way."
2668,Bran,Luwin,"Wolves,Direwolves,"
2669,Luwin,Robb,"Dogs,Yet Im told theres nothing like a wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night."
2670,Luwin,Robb,Take them.Winterfell!
2671,Robb,Stiv,"Back away,or Ill open the boys windpipe, I swear it."
2672,Osha,Robb,Call him off!
2673,Osha,Robb,"Call them both off, or the cripple boy dies now!Grey Wind, Summer, to me,"
2674,Bran,Stiv,"Starks,bloody Starks."
2675,Bran,Stiv,"Osha, kill the wolves and get his sword.Kill them yourself,Ill not be getting near those monsters."
2676,Bran,Robb,"You,You have a name?I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell.This is your brother?Yes.,, Off the horse."
2677,Bran,Robb,Now kill the wolves.
2678,Bran,Robb,You do it.The wolves or the boy.No!
2679,Bran,Stiv,"You   shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?"
2680,Bran,Stiv,You hear me?
2681,Osha,Robb,"Mercy, mlord,"
2682,Bran,Theon,"Are you hurt?He cut my leg,but I couldnt feel it."
2683,Bran,Robb,"A dead enemy is a thing of beauty,Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy,I ought to chain you up in the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at you. You should be thanking me for saving your brothers life.What if you had missed the shot?"
2684,Bran,Robb,What if youd only wounded him?
2685,Robb,Theon,"Did you ever think of that, Greyjoy?"
2686,Robb,Theon,Where were you?
2687,Robb,Theon,I was sure you were close behind us.
2688,Robb,Theon,"We were following, mlord,Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass, begging your pardons, and then, well, as it were He glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed.I spied a turkey,How was I to know that youd leave the boy alone?"
2689,Bran,Luwin,"How badly is my brother wounded?No more than a scratch,"
2690,Robb,Stiv,"Two of them wear the black,"
2691,Luwin,Robb,"Deserters from the Nights Watch,They must have been fools, to come so close to Winterfell.Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart,Shall we bury them, mlord?"
2692,Luwin,Robb,"They would not have buried us,Hack off their heads, well send them back to the Wall.Leave the rest for the carrion crows.And this one?"
2693,Stiv,Theon,"Give me my life, mord of Stark, and I am yours.Mine?What would I do with an oathbreaker?I broke no oaths."
2694,Stiv,Theon,The black crows got no place for women.
2695,Robb,Theon,"Give her to the wolves,"
2696,Bran,Robb,"Shes a woman,A wildling,She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance Rayder.Do you have a name?"
2697,Luwin,Robb,"Osha, as it please the lord,"
2698,Bran,Luwin,We might do well to question her.
2699,Bran,Luwin,"As you say, Maester."
2700,Bran,Luwin,and live or die by the truths she gives us.
2701,Bran,Tyrion,Yu want eat?
2702,Bran,Tyrion,"A leg of lamb would be pleasant,Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down."
2703,Eddison,Tyrion,"I try not to be overly particular.Is beans,Here."
2704,Eddison,Tyrion,"Is here,"
2705,Eddison,Tyrion,Must we play the same fools game with every meal?
2706,Eddison,Tyrion,"Is here, dwarf man."
2707,Eddison,Tyrion,You not want eat?
2708,Eddison,Tyrion,Come take.
2709,Eddison,Tyrion,"Come to think on it, Im not hungry after all,"
2710,Eddison,Tyrion,"You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass,I hope you die of a bloody flux."
2711,Eddison,Tyrion,I take it back!
2712,Marillion,Tyrion,"Ill kill you myself, I swear it!"
2713,Eddison,Tyrion,"You fly,Twenty day, thirty, fifty maybe.Then you fly."
2714,Lysa,Tyrion,Is he the bad man?
2715,Lysa,Tyrion,"He is,"
2716,Lysa,Tyrion,"Hes so small,This is Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister, who murdered your father."
2717,Lysa,Tyrion,"He slew the Hand of the King!Oh, did I kill him too?"
2718,Lysa,Tyrion,"It would seem Ive been a busy little fellow,I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering."
2719,Jon,Lysa,"Imp,"
2720,Jon,Tyrion,"Every one of them would die for me.Lady Arryn, should any harm come to me, my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do."
2721,Lysa,Tyrion,"Can you fly, my lord of Lannister?"
2722,Lysa,Tyrion,"Does a dwarf have wings?If not, you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind.I made no threats,That was a promise."
2723,Lysa,Robert,"You cant hurt us,No one can hurt us here.Tell him, Mother, tell him he cant hurt us here."
2724,Lysa,Robert,"The Eyrie is impregnable,"
2725,Lysa,Tyrion,"The Imp is trying to frighten us, sweet baby."
2726,Lysa,Tyrion,No one will hurt my sweet boy.
2727,Robert,Tyrion,"Not impregnable,merely inconvenient."
2728,Robert,Tyrion,"Youre a liar.Mother, I want to see him fly."
2729,Catelyn,Lysa,"Sister,I beg you to remember, this man is my prisoner."
2730,Lysa,Tyrion,"My sisters little guest is too weary to stand,Ser Vardis, take him down to the dungeon.A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good."
2731,Lysa,Tyrion,"I will remember this,"
2732,Eddison,Tyrion,Mord!
2733,Eddison,Tyrion,"Turnkey!Mord, I want you!"
2734,Eddison,Tyrion,"Making noise,"
2735,Eddison,Tyrion,How would you like to be rich?
2736,Eddison,Tyrion,"No mouth, dwarf man,Gold,Casterly Rock is full of gold ."
2737,Eddison,Tyrion,.
2738,Eddison,Tyrion,"As rich as the Lannisters,Thats what they say, Mord-"
2739,Catelyn,Tyrion,More to say?
2740,Catelyn,Tyrion,"That was a stiff one, Mord."
2741,Catelyn,Tyrion,I could make good use of a strong man like you.
2742,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Gold,"
2743,Catelyn,Tyrion,Lord Mord.
2744,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Is no gold,"
2745,Catelyn,Tyrion,"They relieved me of my purse when they captured me, but the gold is still mine."
2746,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Help me, and all the gold is yours."
2747,Catelyn,Tyrion,There will be no risk to you.All you need do is deliver a message.
2748,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Message,"
2749,Catelyn,Tyrion,"You heard me, my lord."
2750,Catelyn,Tyrion,.at?at would possibly make Lysa Anyn relent?
2751,Eddison,Tyrion,tell her that I wish to confess my crimes.
2752,Jaime,Tyrion,"Is lie,Dwarf man cheat me.,, "
2753,Jaime,Tyrion,"Writing down gold.Much gold.Oh, much gold,The purse is just a taste, my friend.My brother wears armor of solid gold plate."
2754,Tyrion,Vardis,"Now deliver my message,"
2755,Tyrion,Vardis,"On your feet, Imp.My lady wants to see you."
2756,Tyrion,Vardis,"No doubt she does, but what makes you think I wish to see her?"
2757,Tyrion,Vardis,"Your wishes are not my concern.On your feet, or Ill have you carried."
2758,Tyrion,Vardis,"A cold night,"
2759,Tyrion,Vardis,"Mord, if you would be so good, fetch my cloak."
2760,Tyrion,Vardis,"My cloak,The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping.You recall.Get him the damnable cloak,"
2761,Tyrion,Vardis,My thanks.I shall think of you whenever I wear it.
2762,Lysa,Tyrion,"Lead on, Ser Vardis."
2763,Catelyn,Tyrion,"You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.I do, my lady,"
2764,Catelyn,Lysa,"The sky cells always break them.The gods can see them there, and there is no darkness to hide in.He does not look broken to me,"
2765,Lysa,Tyrion,"Say what you will,"
2766,Bronn,Tyrion,Where to begin?
2767,Bronn,Lysa,"I have wished my own lord father dead, and my sister, our gracious queen, as well."
2768,Lysa,Tyrion,I have not always treated my servants with kindness.
2769,Lysa,Tyrion,I have said many cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court.
2770,Lysa,Tyrion,Once I-Silence!
2771,Catelyn,Tyrion,"What do you imagine you are doing, dwarf?"
2772,Catelyn,Tyrion,"Why, confessing my crimes, my lady-You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
2773,Lysa,Tyrion,"Those crimes I cannot confess, I fear.I know nothing of any murders."
2774,Lysa,Vardis,I will not be made mock of.
2775,Tyrion,Vardis,"but this time find him a smaller cell, with a floor more sharply sloped.Is this how justice is done in the Vale?"
2776,Tyrion,Vardis,"Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate?You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve."
2777,Tyrion,Vardis,Where is the kings justice?
2778,Tyrion,Vardis,"Let me speak, and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly, in the sight of gods and men."
2779,Lysa,Vardis,"If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused, then by the kings own laws, you must pay with your lifes blood."
2780,Lysa,Vardis,Open the Moon Door.
2781,Catelyn,Lysa,"Behold the kings justice,"
2782,Catelyn,Lysa,"Lysa, I think this unwise,"
2783,Catelyn,Tyrion,"You want a trial, my lord of Lannister."
2784,Moon,Tyrion,Then you may leave ... by one door or the other.
2785,Moon,Robert,How many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already?    Tyrion said politely.
2786,Nestor,Tyrion,I demand trial by combat.
2787,Lysa,Moon,"You have that right, to be sure."
2788,Lysa,Moon,"My lady, I beg the boon of championing your cause.The honor should be mine,For the love I bore your lord husband, let me avenge his death.My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,Let me serve his son in this.The gods favor the man with the just cause,yet often that turns out to be the man with the surest sword."
2789,Lysa,Vardis,"I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if he were among us."
2790,Lysa,Vardis,Yet I can choose only one.
2791,Lysa,Vardis,"Ser Vardis Egen, you were ever my lord husbands good right hand.You shall be our champion."
2792,Tyrion,Vardis,"My lady,"
2793,Lysa,Tyrion,It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
2794,Lysa,Tyrion,I agree.
2795,Lysa,Tyrion,"You demanded a trial by combat.And now I demand a champion, such as you have chosen for yourself.My brother Jaime will gladly take my part, I know.Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here,Send a bird for him.I will gladly await his arrival.You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow.Singer,when you make a ballad of this, be certain you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight.I deny you nothing!"
2796,Lysa,Tyrion,"Name your champion, Imp ."
2797,Lysa,Tyrion,"if you think you can find a man to die for you.If it is all the same to you, Id sooner find one to kill for me."
2798,Bronn,Tyrion,"Ill stand for the dwarf,"
2799,Eddard,Gerold,"I looked for you on the Trident,We were not there,Woe to the Usurper if we had been,When Kings Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.Far away,or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.I came down on Storms End to lift the siege,I was certain you would be   among them.Our knees do not bend easily,Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys.I thought you might have sailed with him.Ser Willem is a good man and true,But not of the Kingsguard,The Kingsguard does not flee.Then or now,"
2800,Arthur,Gerold,"We swore a vow,"
2801,Arthur,Eddard,"And now it begins,"
2802,Eddard,Lyanna,"No,Now it ends."
2803,Eddard,Lyanna,Eddard!
2804,Eddard,Lyanna,"Lord Eddard,I promise,Lya, I promise "
2805,Eddard,Moon,Lord Eddard?
2806,Eddard,Moon,How .
2807,Moon,Vayon,how long?
2808,Eddard,Vayon,Six days and seven nights.
2809,Eddard,Vayon,"Drink, my lord."
2810,Daenerys,Drogo,Only water.
2811,Eddard,Vayon,"The king left orders,He would speak with you, my lord."
2812,Eddard,Robert,"On the morrow,When I am stronger."
2813,Eddard,Robert,"My lord,he commanded us to send you to him the moment you opened your eyes."
2814,Eddard,Robert,Tell him Im too weak to come to him.
2815,Alyn,Jory,.
2816,Alyn,Jory,Summon the captain of my guard.
2817,Alyn,Eddard,"My lord.Poole tells me it has been six days,I must know how things stand.The Kingslayer is fled the city,The talk is hes ridden back to Casterly Rock to join his father."
2818,Catelyn,Eddard,"I have put on extra guards, if it please you.It does,My daughters?They have been with you every day, my lord."
2819,Arya,Sansa,.
2820,Arya,Sansa,She has not said a word since they brought you back.
2821,Alyn,Arya,"I have never seen such anger in a girl.Whatever happens,I want my daughters kept safe. Alyn said."
2822,Jory,Martyn,Jory would want to lie beside his grandfather.
2823,Eddard,Vayon,"Youve done well, Alyn,"
2824,Eddard,Vayon,"His Grace is without, my lord, and the queen with him."
2825,Cersei,Robert,"Send them in, and leave us.What we have to say should not go beyond these walls."
2826,Cersei,Eddard,"Your Grace,Your pardons.I cannot rise.No matter,Some wine?"
2827,Eddard,Robert,"A good vintage.A small cup,My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy.A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders,Quiet, woman,"
2828,Eddard,Robert,"Does the leg still pain you?Some,"
2829,Eddard,Robert,Pycelle swears it will heal clean.
2830,Eddard,Robert,I take it you know what Catelyn has done?I do.
2831,Eddard,Robert,"My lady wife is blameless, Your Grace.All she did she did at my command.I am not pleased, Eddard,By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood?"
2832,Cersei,Eddard,"Who do you think you are?The Hand of the King,Charged by your own lord husband to keep the kings peace and enforce the kings justice.You were the Hand,but now-Silence!"
2833,Cersei,Robert,You asked him a question and he answered it.
2834,Eddard,Robert,"Keep the kings peace, you say."
2835,Eddard,Robert,".Eight,Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave him.Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets,I will not have it, Eddard.Catelyn had good reason for taking the Irnp-"
2836,Cersei,Eddard,"You will command her to release the dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.Three of my men were butchered before my eyes, because Jaime Lannister wished to chasten me.Am I   to forget that?My brother was not the cause of this quarrel,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel.His men attacked Jaime and his guards, even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad.You know me better than that, Robert,Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me.He was there.Ive talked to Petyr,He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began, but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse.Some whorehouse?"
2837,Eddard,Robert,"She looks like that first girl you fathered, when we were boys together in the Vale."
2838,Eddard,Robert,"Barra,Is that supposed to please me?"
2839,Eddard,Robert,"I thought she had more sense.She cannot be more than fifteen, and a whore, and you thought she had sense?"
2840,Cersei,Eddard,"The fool child is in love with you, Robert."
2841,Cersei,Eddard,"This is no fit subject for the queens ears.Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say,I am told the Kingslayer has fled the city.Give me leave to bring him back to justice."
2842,Eddard,Jaime,"No,I want no more of this."
2843,Eddard,Jaime,Now it ends.Is that your notion of justice?
2844,Eddard,Robert,"If so, I am pleased that I am no longer your Hand."
2845,Jaime,Robert,If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has spoken to you-Do you take me for Aerys?
2846,Jaime,Robert,I took you for a king.
2847,Cersei,Robert,"This man dishonors you with every breath he takes, and yet you stand there meekly, asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine."
2848,Cersei,Robert,"How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue, woman?"
2849,Cersei,Robert,"What a jape the gods have made of us two,By all rights, you ought to be in skirts and me in mail."
2850,Meryn,Robert,"I shall wear this as a badge of honor,Wear it in silence, or Ill honor you again,"
2851,Cersei,Meryn,The queen is tired.See her to her bedchamber.
2852,Cersei,Robert,"You see what she does to me, Eddard."
2853,Eddard,Robert,My loving wife.The mother of my children.
2854,Eddard,Robert,I should not have hit her.
2855,Eddard,Robert,that was not kingly.
2856,Eddard,Robert,I was always strong .
2857,Eddard,Robert,How do you fight someone if you cant hit them?
2858,Eddard,Robert,Rhaegar .
2859,Eddard,Robert,"He has Lyanna now, and I have her."
2860,Eddard,Robert,"Your Grace,"
2861,Eddard,Robert,.
2862,Eddard,Robert,I am sick unto death of talk.
2863,Eddard,Robert,"Whatever you have to say can wait until I return.If the gods are good, I shall not be here on your return.You commanded me to return to Winterfell, remember?"
2864,Eddard,Robert,"The gods are seldom good, Eddard.Here, this is yours."
2865,Eddard,Robert,"Like it or not, you are my Hand, damn you.I forbid you to leave."
2866,Eddard,Robert,"The Targaryen girl-Seven hells, dont start with her again.Thats done, Ill hear no more of it.Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my counsel?Why?"
2867,Eddard,Robert,Why not?
2868,Eddard,Robert,"And if you ever throw it in my face again, I swear to you, Ill pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister."
2869,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Tell me the rest of it,The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock,Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent, but he has had no answer."
2870,Catelyn,Edmure,He vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood.
2871,Edmure,Rodrik,"Edmure has sent riders and made vows,but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun."
2872,Catelyn,Rodrik,"My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick,I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived.Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep, Maester Colemon told me. she insisted. Ser Rodrik said."
2873,Catelyn,Rodrik,"The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and she is too deaf to hear the tune."
2874,Lysa,Rodrik,We can take ship from there.Another ship?
2875,Catelyn,Rodrik,"As you say, my lady."
2876,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Lannister is my prisoner,"
2877,Catelyn,Lysa,My sister must be reminded of that.
2878,Brynden,Lysa,Going to join the fools festival?
2879,Brynden,Edmure,"Id tell you to slap some sense into your sister, if I thought it would do any good, but youd only bruise your hand.There was a bird from Riverrun,"
2880,Brynden,Edmure,".I know, child."
2881,Brynden,Edmure,I had to hear it from Maester Colemon.
2882,Brynden,Catelyn,Your place is here.
2883,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate."
2884,Catelyn,Rodrik,I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall.
2885,Catelyn,Rodrik,Alone?
2886,Brynden,Rodrik,Riverrun will not fight alone.
2887,Brynden,Catelyn,As you say.
2888,Catelyn,Rodrik,Ill wait for you below.
2889,Catelyn,Lysa,Isnt it a lovely morning?
2890,Catelyn,Lysa,"Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars.Thank you, no.Lysa, we must talk.After,Now."
2891,Bronn,Catelyn,"Lysa, you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly."
2892,Bronn,Catelyn,"  Lord Hunter assured her, patting her shoulder with a liver-spotted hand."
2893,Bronn,Catelyn,I wonder.
2894,Catelyn,Lysa,"Women understand little of these things,Ser Vardis is a knight, sweet lady."
2895,Catelyn,Lysa,"Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fellows around them, but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them.Say you have the truth of it, then,What will we gain by the dwarfs death?Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain?Behead the man,When the Kingslayer receives the Imps head, it will be a warning to him,Lord Robert wants to see him fly,And the Imp has only himself to blame.It was he who demanded a trial by combat.Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if shed wished to,"
2896,Catelyn,Lysa,"I remind you, Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner.And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband!"
2897,Catelyn,Lysa,"He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see him pay!"
2898,Lysa,Rodrik,Do you think he did?
2899,Lysa,Rodrik,"Murder Lord Jon, that is?"
2900,Cersei,Lysa,".I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,but whether it was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say."
2901,Cersei,Rodrik,"Poison, well ."
2902,Catelyn,Robert,"Was it poison, my lady?"
2903,Catelyn,Robert,How else could they make it look a natural death?
2904,Colemon,Robert,"The boy is utterly without discipline.He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time.His lord father agreed with you,"
2905,Catelyn,Colemon,"He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering, you know ."
2906,Catelyn,Colemon,"oh, but Im speaking out of turn."
2907,Catelyn,Colemon,I fear Ive had too much of Lord Hunters excellent wine.
2908,Catelyn,Colemon,".You are mistaken, Maester,It was Casterly Rock, not Dragonstone, and those arrangements were made after the Hands death, without my sisters consent."
2909,Catelyn,Tyrion,"No, begging your forgiveness, my lady, but it was Lord Jon who-"
2910,Alys,Robert,"The bad little man,Mother, can I make him fly?I want to see him fly.Later, my sweet baby,Trial first,then execution."
2911,Robert,Vardis,When are they going to fight?
2912,Lysa,Vardis,"I had that sword crafted for Jon in Kings Landing,He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Roberts place."
2913,Catelyn,Vardis,I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.
2914,Robert,Vardis,Make them fight!
2915,Tyrion,Vardis,For the Eyrie and the Vale!
2916,Bronn,Lysa,"They await your command,Fight!"
2917,Bronn,Vardis,"The man is craven,Stand and fight, coward! "
2918,Catelyn,Rodrik,He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him.The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man.
2919,Bran,Brandon,"He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother.It would grieve me to see him die."
2920,Brandon,Petyr,Yield!
2921,Catelyn,Petyr,Cat
2922,Alys,Vardis,"Theyre not fighting good, Mother,I want them to fight.They will, sweet baby,The sellsword cant run all day."
2923,Bronn,Vardis,"Behind you, ser!"
2924,Catelyn,Rodrik,"Ser Vardis is hurt,"
2925,Lysa,Vardis,"Enough, Ser Vardis!"
2926,Lysa,Vardis,"Finish him now, my baby is growing tired."
2927,Catelyn,Lysa,"Is it over, Mother?"
2928,Catelyn,Lysa,"Yes,Can I make the little man fly now?"
2929,Lysa,Tyrion,"Not this little man,This little man is going down in the turnip hoist, thank you very much.You presume-I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words,As High as Honor. You promised I could make him fly,"
2930,Lysa,Tyrion,"The gods have seen fit to proclaim him innocent, child.We have no choice but to free him."
2931,Lysa,Tyrion,Guards.
2932,Lysa,Tyrion,"They shall need them on the high road.The high road,"
2933,Catelyn,Tyrion,"As you command, my lady,I believe we know the way."
2934,Daenerys,Drogo, Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard.
2935,Alliser,Jon,"To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will."
2936,Alliser,Jon,Toad.
2937,Alliser,Jon,Ser Loon.
2938,Alliser,Jon,And the Bastard.
2939,Alliser,Jon,"They will call you men of Nights Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummers Monkey here if you believe that.You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies."
2940,Grenn,Halder,"Toad, of the Nights Watch!"
2941,Jon,Samwell,A swallow of wine?
2942,Jon,Samwell,"No thank you, Jon.Are you well?Very well, truly,I am so happy for you all."
2943,Benjen,Jon,"You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.Is, "
2944,Benjen,Grenn,"Here, you planning to drink that all yourself?"
2945,Bowen,Jon,"From the Lord Commanders own table,"
2946,Bowen,Grenn,Do you think theyll keep us together?
2947,Bowen,Grenn,"I hope not.Im sick of looking at those ears of yours.Ho,Listen to the crow call the raven black."
2948,Bowen,Grenn,"If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and hell run off screaming."
2949,Bowen,Grenn,"I hope Im a ranger.You and everyone else,"
2950,Grenn,Halder,"Not everyone,Its the builders for me.What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?"
2951,Dareon,Jon,"The Old Bears no fool,Youre certain to be a builder, and Jons certain to be a ranger."
2952,Dareon,Jon,.
2953,Dareon,Jon,"Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,"
2954,Hobb,Jon,Arent you going to eat those?
2955,Hobb,Jon,Theyre yours.
2956,Hobb,Jon,I could not eat another bite.
2957,Hobb,Jon,"Jon, what is it?SamwellHe was not at table tonight.Its not like him to miss a meal,Do you suppose hes taken ill?Hes frightened.Were leaving him."
2958,Arya,Samwell,"Once we say our words, well all have duties to attend to."
2959,Jon,Rast,"Gods only know what theyll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first chance he gets."
2960,Jon,Rast,"You did all you could.All we could wasnt enough,"
2961,Aemon,Jon,"I have not   sworn yet,"
2962,Chett,Jon,"I need to speak to Maester Aemon,The maester is abed, as you should be.Come back on the morrow and maybe hell see you."
2963,Chett,Jon,I need to speak to him now.The morning will be too late.
2964,Chett,Jon,"The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night.Do you know how old he is?Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,Give him my pardons.I would not disturb his rest if it were not important.And if I refuse?"
2965,Chett,Jon,I can stand here all night if I must.
2966,Chett,Jon,Wait in the library.
2967,Chett,Jon,I wont have the maester catching a chill on account of you.
2968,Aemon,Chett,"The chair beside the fire would be pleasant,"
2969,Aemon,Jon,"I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,You did not wake me,I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old."
2970,Chett,Jon,"So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Nights Watch.This is no concern of Maester Aemon,Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne,Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know.Why then come to me?The Lord Commander listens to you,And the wounded and the sick of the Nights Watch are in your charge.And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?He will be,unless you help."
2971,Chett,Jon,"Without us to keep him safe, Samwellwill have no chance,Hes hopeless with a sword."
2972,Arya,Chett,"If Ser Alliser makes him fight, its only a matter of time before hes hurt or killed."
2973,Aemon,Chett,"Ive seen this fat boy in the common hall,He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.Maybe it is so,Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?Leave him where he is,The Wall is no place for the weak."
2974,Aemon,Jon,"Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.Thats stupid, "
2975,Aemon,Jon,I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.
2976,Aemon,Jon,"Go on.He told me that a maesters collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve,I asked why each link was a different metal."
2977,Aemon,Randyll,"A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people."
2978,Aemon,Randyll,And so?The Nights Watch needs all sorts too.
2979,Alliser,Chett,Why shouldnt Samwellbe a steward?
2980,Alliser,Chett,Im a steward.
2981,Aemon,Jon,The stewards.
2982,Aemon,Jon,"Is your friend a hunter?He hates hunting,Can he plow a field?"
2983,Aemon,Jon,"Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship?Could he butcher a cow?No.,, Chett gave a nasty laugh.Ive seen what happens to soft lordlings when theyre put to work."
2984,Aemon,Jon,"Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.I know one thing Samwellcould do better than anyone.Yes?"
2985,Chett,Clydas,"He could help you,He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write."
2986,Aemon,Jon,Make use of him instead.
2987,Daenerys,Drogo,"Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow."
2988,Jon,Luwin,"It means I shall think on what you have said,And now, I believe I am ready to sleep.Chett, show our young brother to the door."
2989,Bronn,Tyrion,Will this do?
2990,Bronn,Tyrion,Morrec did that for me.Afire?
2991,Bronn,Tyrion,"Are you so hungry to die, dwarf?"
2992,Bronn,Tyrion,"I mean to survive this journey, Lannister.And how do you hope to do that?"
2993,Tyrion,Vardis,"We have no chance of fighting our way back,"
2994,Tyrion,Vardis,"Travel by night and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, make no noise and light no fires."
2995,Tyrion,Vardis,"A splendid plan, Bronn."
2996,Tyrion,Vardis,"and forgive me if I do not linger to bury you.You think to outlive me, dwarf?"
2997,Tyrion,Vardis,Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull.
2998,Bronn,Tyrion,Their eyes are all around us.
2999,Bronn,Tyrion,"Then were dead men, Lannister.If so, I prefer to die comfortable,We need a fire."
3000,Bronn,Tyrion,"Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef, hard cheese, and stale bread, but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester.I can find meat."
3001,Bronn,Tyrion,I should   leave you here with your fools fire.
3002,Bronn,Tyrion,"What would you do then, dwarf?Die, most like."
3003,Bronn,Tyrion,"You dont think Id do it?Youd do it in an instant, if it meant your life.You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly."
3004,Catelyn,Chiggen,"He was good as dead,"
3005,Bronn,Tyrion,"I fought for you, but I do not love you.It was your blade I needed,not your love."
3006,Bronn,Tyrion,"Youre bold as any sellsword, Ill give you that.How did you know Id take your part?Know?"
3007,Chiggen,Tyrion,I tossed the dice.
3008,Catelyn,Chiggen,"You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves?"
3009,Bronn,Catelyn,"Well, why do sellswords do anything?"
3010,Bronn,Tyrion,Do you have a flint?
3011,Eddard,Tyrion,"My thanks,The thing is, you did not know the Starks."
3012,Bronn,Tyrion,"The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum."
3013,Bronn,Tyrion,"You have a bold tongue, little man.One day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it.Everyone tells me that."
3014,Bronn,Tyrion,Did I offend you?
3015,Bronn,Tyrion,"Happily for me, you did."
3016,Bronn,Tyrion,"Here,Ill do it."
3017,Bronn,Tyrion,"Well done,Scum you may be, but youre undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand youre almost as good as my brother Jaime."
3018,Bronn,Tyrion,"Keep me alive, and youll have it."
3019,Bronn,Tyrion,"And if you die?Why then, Ill have one mourner whose grief is sincere,The gold ends when I do."
3020,Bronn,Tyrion,"Fair enough,My swords yours, then ."
3021,Bronn,Tyrion,"Im no mans toady.Nor any mans friend,Ive no doubt youd betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it."
3022,Bronn,Tyrion,"And now, do you think you could do something about finding us some supper?Take care of the horses,"
3023,Bronn,Tyrion,"All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid,That, a woman, and another dozen swords,"
3024,Bronn,Tyrion,"It will be full dark soon,Ill take first watch ."
3025,Bronn,Tyrion,"It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep.Oh, I imagine theyll be here long before it comes to sleep."
3026,Bronn,Tyrion,"You have a plan,A hope, call it,Another toss of the dice.With our lives as the stake?"
3027,Bronn,Tyrion,What choice do we have?
3028,Bronn,Tyrion,"Ahhhh,"
3029,Bronn,Tyrion,"A bit tougher than Id like, and in want of spicing, but Ill not complain too loudly.If I were back at the Eyrie, Id be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean.And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold,A Lannister always pays his debts."
3030,Bronn,Tyrion,"I kept the silver,but you were promised the gold, and there it is."
3031,Bronn,Tyrion,"And remember what I said, this is only a taste.If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryns service, present yourself at Casterly Rock, and Ill pay you the rest of what I owe you."
3032,Bronn,Tyrion,"If we do reach the river, what will you do then?"
3033,Bronn,Tyrion,"Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start."
3034,Bronn,Tyrion,"And then to Casterly Rock or Kings Landing, I think.I have some questions that want answering, concerning a certain dagger."
3035,Bronn,Tyrion,So you were telling it true?It was not your knife?
3036,Bronn,Tyrion,Do I look a liar to you?
3037,Bronn,Tyrion,"Our friends are taking their sweet time.If I were them, Id fear a trap,Why else would we be so open, if not to lure them in?"
3038,Bronn,Tyrion,Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror.
3039,Bronn,Tyrion,"Youre mad, dwarf,Wheres your love of music, Bronn?If it was music you wanted, you should have gotten the singer to champion you."
3040,Bronn,Tyrion,That would have been amusing.I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his woodharp.
3041,Bronn,Tyrion,Do you know this song?
3042,Bronn,Tyrion,"You hear it here and there, in inns and whorehouses.Myrish."
3043,Bronn,Tyrion,"The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it, and Ive never been able to put it out of my head."
3044,Bronn,Tyrion,"I met her on a night like this,Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream, and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels, shouting   threats."
3045,Eddison,Jaime,Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men.
3046,Bronn,Tyrion,She was hungrier than I would have believed.
3047,Bronn,Tyrion,"When I broke her maidenhead, she wept, but afterward she kissed me and sang her little song, and by morning I was in love.You?"
3048,Bronn,Tyrion,"Absurd, isnt it?"
3049,Bronn,Tyrion,"I married her,A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofters daughter,How did you manage that?Oh, youd be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies, fifty pieces of silver, and a drunken septon."
3050,Bronn,Tyrion,And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father.
3051,Jaime,Tyrion,That was the end of my marriage.
3052,Jaime,Tyrion,"He sent the girl away?He did better than that,First he made my brother tell me the truth."
3053,Jaime,Tyrion,"After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards."
3054,Bronn,Tyrion,.
3055,Bronn,Tyrion,"Lord Tywin had me go last,And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more."
3056,Bronn,Tyrion,"Thirteen or thirty or three, I would have killed the man who did that to me."
3057,Bronn,Tyrion,You may get that chance one day.
3058,Bronn,Tyrion,A Lannister always pays his debts.
3059,Bronn,Tyrion,I think I will try and sleep.Wake me if were about to die.
3060,Bronn,Tyrion,Tyrion. 
3061,Bronn,Tyrion,"Come share our fire, the night is cold,I fear weve no wine to offer you, but youre welcome to some of our goat."
3062,Bronn,Tyrion,"Our mountain,Our goat.Your goat,Who are you?When you meet your gods,say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them."
3063,Conn,Tyrion,And Shagga son of Dolf.
3064,Conn,Tyrion,"I am Tyrion son of Tywin, of the Clan Lannister, the Lions of the Rock.We will gladly pay you for the goat we ate.What do you have to give us, Tyrion son of Tywin?"
3065,Shagga,Tyrion,"There is silver in my purse,This hauberk I wear is large for me, but it should fit Conn nicely, and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shaggas mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he holds.The halfman would pay us with our own coin,Conn speaks truly,Your silver is ours."
3066,Bronn,Shagga,"How   would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maidens mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty,"
3067,Bronn,Shagga,"Conn, take their horses,Kill the other and seize the halfinan.He can milk the goats and make the mothers laugh."
3068,Bronn,Tyrion,Who dies first?No!
3069,Bronn,Tyrion,"Gunthor son of Gurn, hear me."
3070,Shagga,Tyrion,"If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains, my lord father will shower you with gold.The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfmans promises,Half a man I may be,yet I have the courage to face my enemies."
3071,Shagga,Tyrion,Are these the best weapons you could steal?
3072,Shagga,Tyrion,"Good enough for killing sheep, perhaps ."
3073,Tyrion,Tywin,"My fathers smiths shit better steel.Little boyman,will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood and feed it to the goats?"
3074,Tyrion,Tywin,No.
3075,Tyrion,Tywin,"Mail?All that, and more, Gunthor son of Gurn,I will give you the Vale of Arryn."
3076,Robert,Varys,You are quite certain these were more than brigands?
3077,Catelyn,Eddard,"Brigands, Lord Varys?"
3078,Catelyn,Eddard,"Oh, they were brigands, beyond a doubt.Lannister brigands."
3079,Eddard,Karyl,"This is all the remains of the holdfast of Sherrer, Lord Eddard.The rest are dead, along with the people of Wendish Town and the Mummers Ford.Rise,"
3080,Eddard,Karyl,"All of you, up."
3081,Eddard,Eddison,"Joss,Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer."
3082,Eddard,Eddison,"If it please His Grace-His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater,"
3083,Eddard,Eddison,"I am Lord Eddard Stark, the Kings Hand.Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders.I keep ."
3084,Eddard,Eddison,"Mlord.They burnt us out,Come riding in the dark, up from the south, and fired the fields and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop them."
3085,Eddard,Eddison,"They had no mind to steal our stock, not these, they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows.They rode down my prentice boy,"
3086,Eddard,Varys,"Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was a game, them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean through."
3087,Eddard,Varys,"They killed my mother too, Your Grace."
3088,Eddard,Varys,.
3089,Eddard,Varys,"At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in their holdfast, but the walls were timbered."
3090,Eddard,Varys,"When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running out, even women with suckling babes.Oh, dreadful,How cruel can men be?They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfasts made of stone,Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver, and they made for the Mummers Ford."
3091,Eddard,Marq,What proof do you have that these were Lannisters?
3092,Eddard,Marq,"Did they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner?Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that,"
3093,Edmure,Karyl,"Every man among them was mounted and mailed, my lord,They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with battle-axes for the butchering."
3094,Edmure,Karyl,You.
3095,Edmure,Karyl,Tell the Hand what you told   me.
3096,Karyl,Petyr,"Concerning their horses,"
3097,Eddard,Petyr,"Not a one of these ever pulled a plow, gods bear witness if Im wrong.Well-mounted brigands,Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided.How many men were there in this raiding party?"
3098,Eddard,Petyr,"A hundred, at the least,Fifty,Hunnerds and hunnerds, mord, an army they was.You are more right than you know, goodwoman,You say they flew no banners."
3099,Eddard,Petyr,"Did any of you note ornaments or decorations, devices on shield or helm?"
3100,Eddard,Petyr,"It grieves me, mord, but no, the armor they showed us was plain, only ."
3101,Eddard,Marq,"Big as an ox he was, and a voice like stone breaking.Gregor!"
3102,Eddard,Marq,Can any man doubt it?This was Gregor Cleganes work.
3103,Karyl,Pycelle,"Ser Marq, with respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor.There are many large men in the realm.As large as the Mountain That Rides?"
3104,Karyl,Pycelle,"I have never met one.Nor has any man here,Even his brother is a pup beside him."
3105,Marq,Pycelle,It was Gregor.Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?
3106,Marq,Pycelle,"By the grace of his liege lord, he holds a stout keep and lands of his own.The man is an anointed knight.A false knight!"
3107,Eddard,Marq,"Lord Tywins mad dog.My lord Hand,I urge you to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin Lannister is the father of our own gracious queen.Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle,I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out."
3108,Karyl,Petyr,"Ser Marq, Ser Karyl, Ser Raymun-perhaps I might ask you a question?"
3109,Karyl,Petyr,Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on?
3110,Karyl,Petyr,"I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth, as was Ser Marq.When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully, he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king."
3111,Karyl,Petyr,Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength.
3112,Marq,Petyr,"By the time  could return to my own lands, Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for Lannisters hills."
3113,Marq,Petyr,"And if they come again, ser?If they come again, well use their blood to water the fields they burnt,Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a days ride of the border,The next raider will not have such an easy time of it."
3114,Hoster,Tywin,"If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm,what then do you ask of the throne?The lords of the Trident keep the kings peace,The Lannisters have broken it."
3115,Hoster,Tywin,"We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummers Ford.Edmure agrees, we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin,but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the kings leave before we strike."
3116,Pycelle,Robert,"My lord Hand, if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape, let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint."
3117,Eddard,Pycelle,"Let them seek Lord Tywins justice.It is all the kings justice,North, south, east, or west, all we do we do in Roberts name.The kings justice,So it is, and so we should defer this matter until the king-The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days,Robert bid me to sit here in his place, to listen with his ears, and to speak with his voice.I mean to do just that ... though I agree that he must be told."
3118,Eddard,Robar,Ser Robar.
3119,Eddard,Robar,"My lord.Your father is hunting with the king,Will you bring them word of what was said and done here today?At once, my lord.Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?"
3120,Eddard,Marq,Vengeance?
3121,Eddard,Marq,"I thought we were speaking of justice.Burning Cleganes fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the kings peace, only your injured pride."
3122,Eddard,Marq,"People of Sherrer, I cannot give you back your homes or your crops, nor can I restore your dead to life.But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice, in the name of our king, Robert."
3123,Eddard,Loras,"The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword, and in the north we hold to that still."
3124,Eddard,Loras,yet it seems I have no choice.
3125,Loras,Petyr,Lord Eddard!
3126,Loras,Petyr,"I beg you the honor of acting in your place.Give this task to me, my lord, and I swear I shall not fail you."
3127,Loras,Petyr,"Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours.Gregor is not the sort to bend his neck to any mans justice.I do not fear Gregor Clegane,"
3128,Aegon,Eddard,"Lord Beric,Thoros of Myr."
3129,Aegon,Eddard,Lord Lothar.
3130,Aegon,Eddard,"Each of you is to assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregors keep."
3131,Aegon,Eddard,"Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the command, as befits your rank."
3132,Aegon,Eddard,"As you command, Lord Eddard."
3133,Eddard,Loras,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, his Hand, I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the kings flag, and there bring the kings justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in his crimes."
3134,Eddard,Loras,May the gods take pity on his soul.
3135,Eddard,Loras,"Lord Eddard, what of me?"
3136,Beric,Robb,"No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and what you seek is vengeance."
3137,Alyn,Beric,Ride at first light.These things are best done quickly.
3138,Alyn,Beric,The throne will hear no more petitions today.
3139,Eddard,Pycelle,"You are a bolder man than , my lord,How so, Lord Varys?"
3140,Eddard,Pycelle,"Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras."
3141,Eddard,Pycelle,"and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends.Ser Loras is young,I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment.And Ser Ilyn?"
3142,Eddard,Varys,"He is the Kings Justice, after all."
3143,Eddard,Varys,some might construe that as a grave insult.No slight was intended.
3144,Eddard,Varys,"I remind you, the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister.I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty.Very prudent, no doubt,Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight."
3145,Sansa,Varys,.
3146,Jeyne,Sansa,"He wouldnt send Ser Loras,I think it was because of his leg."
3147,Jeyne,Sansa,His leg?
3148,Jeyne,Sansa,"Did Ser Loras hurt his leg?Not his leg,Fathers leg, silly."
3149,Nan,Sansa,Otherwise Im certain he would have sent Ser Loras.
3150,Daenerys,Drogo,
3151,Mordane,Sansa,The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.
3152,Mordane,Sansa,"The girl was just talking, my lord,Foolish chatter.She meant nothing by the comment.Nothing?"
3153,Jeyne,Sansa,"Well, those are not the reasons Id have given, but ."
3154,Jeyne,Sansa,.
3155,Jeyne,Sansa,"Life is not a song, sweetling.You may learn that one day to your sorrow."
3156,Jeyne,Sansa,"Ser Ilyns the Kings Justice, not Ser Loras,Lord Eddard should have sent him."
3157,Beric,Sansa,"Ser Ilyns almost like a second monster.Im glad Father didnt pick him.Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras.Hes ever so brave and gallant.I suppose,"
3158,Beric,Sansa,"I had a dream that Joffreytey would be the one to take the white hart,"
3159,Joffrey,Sansa,A dream?
3160,Joffrey,Sansa,"Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it no harm?No,He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me."
3161,Arya,Jeyne,"I saw your sister this afternoon,She was walking through the stables on her hands.Why would she do a thing like that?Im sure I dont know why Arya does anything."
3162,Benjen,Jeyne,"Do you want to hear about the court or not?I do,There-was a black brother,begging men for the Wall, only he was kind of old and smelly."
3163,Jeyne,Jon,"Father asked if there were any knights in the hall   who would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward, so he gave this Yoren his pick of the kings dungeons and sent him on his way."
3164,Jeyne,Sansa,.
3165,Jeyne,Sansa,Are there any lemon cakes?
3166,Jeyne,Sansa,"Lets see,"
3167,Arya,Sansa,Where is everyone?
3168,Mordane,Sansa,Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister?
3169,Mordane,Sansa,"They rode with Lord Beric, to behead Ser Gregor Clegane."
3170,Jeyne,Mordane,"Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregors head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king?"
3171,Arya,Sansa,A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge.
3172,Arya,Sansa,"I swear, of late youve been near as bad as your sister.What did Gregor do?"
3173,Arya,Sansa,"He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women and children too."
3174,Arya,Sansa,"Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and Wyl, and the Hound murdered Mycah.Somebody should have beheaded them.Its not the same,Sandor is Joffreys sworn shield.Your butchers boy attacked the prince.Liar,"
3175,Arya,Sansa,"Go ahead, call me all the names you want,You wont dare when Im married to Joffrey.Youll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace."
3176,Arya,Sansa,"You have juice on your face, Your Grace,"
3177,Mordane,Sansa,"Youre horrible,They should have killed you instead of Lady!"
3178,Mordane,Sansa,Your lord father will hear of this!
3179,Mordane,Sansa,At once!Me too?
3180,Mordane,Sansa,Thats not fair.The matter is not subject to discussion.Go!
3181,Mordane,Sansa,I hate her!
3182,Mordane,Sansa,Sansa.Your lord father will see you now.
3183,Mordane,Sansa,"Lady,"
3184,Eddard,Mordane,Sansa.
3185,Eddard,Mordane,"Do you hear me?Yes, Septa,Might I have a moment to dress, please?"
3186,Arya,Mordane,"Come here, Sansa,Sit beside me."
3187,Arya,Sansa,"Here is the other one,My thanks, Septa Mordane.I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would be so kind."
3188,Eddard,Sansa,"Arya started it,She called me a liar and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the one Queen Cersei gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey."
3189,Arya,Eddard,"She tries to spoil everything, Father, she cant stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid.Enough, Sansa."
3190,Arya,Sansa,"Im sorry, Father.I was wrong and I beg my sweet sisters forgiveness."
3191,Arya,Sansa,What about my dress?Maybe .
3192,Daenerys,Drogo, Arya said doubtfully. Sansa said.
3193,Daenerys,Drogo,
3194,Arya,Sansa,You?You couldnt sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.
3195,Arya,Sansa,I did not call you here to talk of dresses.Im sending you both back to Winterfell.
3196,Arya,Sansa,"You cant,Please, Father,Please dont."
3197,Eddard,Sansa,"At last weve found something you agree on.I didnt do anything wrong,I dont want to go back."
3198,Arya,Robert,"Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swear it.Ill be good, youll see, just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen."
3199,Arya,Robert,"Sansa, Im not sending you away for fighting, though the gods know Im sick of you two squabbling."
3200,Arya,Robert,He goes hunting.
3201,Arya,Sansa,Can we take Syrio back with us?Who cares about your stupid dancing master?
3202,Arya,Sansa,"Father, I only just now remembered, I cant go away, Im to marry Prince Joffrey."
3203,Arya,Sansa,"I love him, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian.I want to be his queen and have his babies.Sweet one,"
3204,Joffrey,Sansa,"That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.He is!"
3205,Joffrey,Sansa,"I dont want someone brave and gentle, I want him."
3206,Arya,Sansa,"Ill give him a son with golden hair, and one day hell be the king of all the realm, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion."
3207,Arya,Sansa,"Not if Joffreys his father,Hes a liar and a craven and anyhow hes a stag, not a lion."
3208,Arya,Sansa,He is not!
3209,Mordane,Sansa,"Gods, "
3210,Mordane,Sansa,.
3211,Daenerys,Drogo,
3212,Mordane,Sansa,Well talk again tomorrow.
3213,Arya,Mordane,"Stop that weeping, child,I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you.It wont be so bad, Sansa,Were going to sail on a galley.It will be an adventure, and then well be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest."
3214,Arya,Sansa,Hodor!
3215,Arya,Sansa,"You ought to marry Hodor, youre just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!"
3216,Eddard,Pycelle,"Pain is a gift from the gods, Lord Eddard,It means the bone is knitting, the flesh healing itself.Be thankful.I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing."
3217,Eddard,Pycelle,"The milk of the poppy, for when the pain grows too onerous.I sleep too much already.Sleep is the great healer.I had hoped that was you."
3218,Eddard,Pycelle,"It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord."
3219,Eddard,Pycelle,"There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from her lord father.I thought you had best know.Dark wings, dark words,What of it?Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane,I feared he would be.You will recall, I said as much in council.Let him be wroth,"
3220,Beric,Jory,Let him write all the letters to the queen he likes.
3221,Pycelle,Robert,The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him.
3222,Pycelle,Robert,As you say.I shall visit again on the morrow.
3223,Petyr,Varys,"I cannot visit long, my lord,Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her."
3224,Petyr,Varys,"And how is your leg?Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad."
3225,Petyr,Varys,"In future, try not to let any horses fall on it."
3226,Eddard,Varys,"Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock, and not for the thin pleasure of Lord Tywins conversation.Is there word of the king?"
3227,Eddard,Petyr,"Just how long does Robert intend to hunt?Given his preferences, I believe hed stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age,Lacking that, I imagine hell return as soon as hes killed something."
3228,Balon,Eddard,The rest are still with the king.Sandor?
3229,Jaime,Petyr,"Oh, returned with Joffrey, and went straight to the queen."
3230,Jaime,Petyr,"I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother.Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother.Ah, but Gregor was his to loathe, not yours to kill."
3231,Petyr,Sandor,Lady Tanda awaits with her fatted calves.
3232,Eddard,Petyr,"The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it.A sleeping potion, my lord?"
3233,Eddard,Petyr,"Jon Arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick,"
3234,Eddard,Petyr,"In that case,death must have come as a blessed relief."
3235,Eddard,Tomard,"I shall require your help,Take me to the godswood.Is that wise, Lord Eddard?With your leg and all?Perhaps not.But necessary."
3236,Eddard,Tomard,"I want the guard doubled,No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave."
3237,Eddard,Tomard,"NIlord, with Alyn and the others away, we are hardpressed already-It will only be a short while. Tom answered. "
3238,Eddard,Tomard,Thank you.
3239,Eddard,Tomard,Kindly deliver this at once.
3240,Eddard,Tomard,My lord .
3241,Eddard,Tomard,".Do as I bid you, Tom,"
3242,Cersei,Eddard,Why here?
3243,Cersei,Eddard,So the gods can see.
3244,Cersei,Eddard,"I know the truth Jon Arryn died for,Do you?"
3245,Cersei,Eddard,"Is that why you called me here, Lord Stark?"
3246,Cersei,Eddard,"Or is it your intent to seize me, as your wife seized my brother?If you truly believed that, you would never have come."
3247,Cersei,Eddard,Has he done this before?Once or twice.
3248,Cersei,Eddard,"Never on the face before.Jaime would have killed him, even if it meant his own life."
3249,Cersei,Eddard,My brother is worth a hundred of your friend.Your brother?
3250,Cersei,Eddard,Or your lover?Both.
3251,Cersei,Eddard,Since we were children together.
3252,Cersei,Robert,whole.
3253,Cersei,Robert,My son Bran .
3254,Cersei,Robert,.
3255,Cersei,Robert,"He saw us.You love your children, do you not?"
3256,Eddard,Robert,With all my heart.No less do I love mine.
3257,Catelyn,Jon,"All three are Jaimes,"
3258,Catelyn,Jon,Thank the gods.
3259,Eddard,Eddison,"A dozen years,How is it that you have had no children by the king?"
3260,Eddard,Eddison,"Your Robert got me with child once,My brother found a woman to cleanse me."
3261,Eddard,Eddison,"Whatever we do, the king is usually so drunk that hes forgotten it all by the next morning."
3262,Eddard,Joffrey,"I remember Robert as he was the day he took the throne, every inch a king,A thousand other women might have loved him with all their hearts.What did he do to make you hate him so?"
3263,Eddard,Joffrey,"The night of our wedding feast, the first time we shared a bed, he called me by your sisters name.He was on top of me, in me, stinking of wine, and he whispered Lyanna. "
3264,Eddard,Joffrey,I do not know which of you I pity most.
3265,Eddard,Joffrey,"Save your pity for yourself, Lord Stark.I want none of it.You know what I must do.Must?"
3266,Eddard,Joffrey,"A true man does what he will, not what he must."
3267,Eddard,Joffrey,The realm needs a strong Hand.
3268,Eddard,Joffrey,"No one wants war again, least of all me."
3269,Eddard,Joffrey,"If friends can turn to enemies, enemies can become friends."
3270,Eddard,Joffrey,"I swear to you, you shall never regret it.Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn?"
3271,Eddard,Joffrey,"I shall wear that as a badge of honor,Honor, How dare you play the noble lord with me!"
3272,Asha,Eddard,"Tell me, my honorable Lord Eddard, how are you any different from Robert, or me, or Jaime?For a start,"
3273,Jaime,Tywin,"As far as the winds blow.Exile,A bitter cup to drink from.A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegars children,"
3274,Jaime,Tywin,"I promise you, no matter where you flee, Roberts wrath will follow you, to the back of beyond if need be."
3275,Jaime,Tywin,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?"
3276,Jaime,Tywin,You should have taken the realm for yourself.
3277,Cersei,Jaime,"Such a sad mistake.I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine,but that was not one of them.Oh, but it was, my lord,When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.There is no middle ground."
3278,Daenerys,Jhiqui,Khalakka dothrae mranha!
3279,Eddison,Jhiqui,Khalakka dothrae!
3280,Eddison,Jhiqui,He is tiding!
3281,Eddison,Jhiqui,Rakh!
3282,Eddison,Jhiqui,Rakh haj!
3283,Daenerys,Drogo,"I have seen his face, and heard the thunder of his hooves,The thunder of his hooves!"
3284,Daenerys,Drogo,"As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass."
3285,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name."
3286,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.The stallion who mounts the world!"
3287,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"What shall he be called, the stallion who mounts the world?"
3288,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"He shall be called Rhaego,"
3289,Drogo,Jhiqui,"Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!"
3290,Drogo,Jorah,"What is meaning, name Rhaego?"
3291,Drogo,Viserys,"My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,He died before I was born.Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons."
3292,Drogo,Jhiqui,"Is good name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life,"
3293,Daenerys,Drogo,"The stallion who mounts the world, "
3294,Daenerys,Drogo,"The stallion that mounts the world, "
3295,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Khaleesi, I am yours to command."
3296,Jhiqui,Jorah,Sit and talk with me.You honor me.
3297,Daenerys,Jorah,Where is my brother?
3298,Daenerys,Jorah,"He ought to have come by now, for the feast.I saw His Grace this morning,He told me he was going to the Western Market, in search of wine.Wine?"
3299,Daenerys,Viserys,"Wine,and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords who guard the caravans."
3300,Jorah,Viserys,Is that wise?
3301,Jorah,Viserys,He has no gold to pay soldiers.What if hes betrayed?
3302,Daenerys,Jorah,"You ought to have gone with him, to keep him safe.You are his sworn sword.We are in Vaes Dothrak,No one may carry a blade here or shed a mans blood.Yet men die,Jhogo told me."
3303,Daenerys,Jorah,That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered.Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything.
3304,Daenerys,Jorah,"He had planned to take your dragons eggs, until I warned him that Id cut off his hand if he so much as touched them."
3305,Daenerys,Jorah,"My eggs ... but theyre mine, Magister Illyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want ."
3306,Daenerys,Jorah,".The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, Princess ."
3307,Daenerys,Jorah,"Those traders hes been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need."
3308,Daenerys,Jorah,Then .
3309,Jorah,Viserys,"and my true king.He is your brother,You do not understand, ser,My mother died giving me birth, and my father and my brother Rhaegar even before that."
3310,Jorah,Viserys,"He is all I have.Once,No longer, Khaleesi."
3311,Daenerys,Jorah,In your womb rides the stallion who mounts the world.
3312,Daenerys,Doreah,What does it mean?
3313,Daenerys,Doreah,"What is this stallion?Everyone was shouting it at me, but I dont understand.The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy, child."
3314,Daenerys,Doreah,"All the people of the world will be his herd.Oh,"
3315,Daenerys,Doreah,I   named him Rhaego.A name to make the Usurpers blood run cold.
3316,Daenerys,Doreah,"My lady, "
3317,Daenerys,Doreah,.
3318,Jorah,Viserys,"Go to him,Stop him."
3319,Jorah,Viserys,Tell him he can have the dragons eggs if that is what he wants.
3320,Jorah,Viserys,Where is my sister?
3321,Jorah,Viserys,Ive come for her feast.
3322,Jorah,Viserys,The whore cant hide from the dragon.
3323,Daenerys,Viserys,Keep your hands off me!No one touches the dragon without leave.
3324,Jorah,Viserys,"Khal Drogo,Im here for the feast."
3325,Daenerys,Jorah,"Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,Khal Drogo says your place is there."
3326,Jorah,Viserys,"That is no place for a king,Is place,for Sorefoot King."
3327,Jorah,Viserys,A cart!Bring cart for Khal Rhaggat! 
3328,Jorah,Viserys,Keep away from me!
3329,Daenerys,Viserys,"There she is,"
3330,Daenerys,Viserys,The blade .
3331,Daenerys,Drogo, she begged him.
3332,Daenerys,Viserys,"You can have them, only throw away the sword.Do as she tells you, fool,before you get us all killed."
3333,Daenerys,Viserys,They cant kill us.
3334,Daenerys,Viserys,but I can.
3335,Daenerys,Viserys,"I want what I came for,I want the crown he promised me."
3336,Daenerys,Viserys,Ill cut the bastard out and leave it for him.
3337,Drogo,Jhiqui,"Dont be afraid,I shall tell him."
3338,Daenerys,Drogo,What did he say?
3339,Daenerys,Viserys,He says you shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.
3340,Daenerys,Viserys,"That was all I wanted,What was promised."
3341,Drogo,Viserys,"No,you cannot touch me, I am the dragon, the dragon, and I will be crowned!"
3342,Daenerys,Jorah,"Turn away, my princess, I beg you.No."
3343,Daenerys,Viserys,"Sister, please ."
3344,Daenerys,Drogo,.
3345,Drogo,Viserys,Crown!
3346,Drogo,Viserys,Here.A crown for Cart King!
3347,Brandon,Lyanna,"Promise me, Eddard, "
3348,Eddard,Tomard,"Lord Eddard,A moment."
3349,Eddard,Robert,"My lord Hand,His Grace the King commands your presence.At once."
3350,Cayn,Eddard,I shall need a few moments to dress.
3351,Eddard,Robert,"Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King,Bring him here,"
3352,Eddard,Robert,"Eddard,"
3353,Eddard,Robert,Come .
3354,Eddard,Robert,closer.
3355,Renly,Robert,What .
3356,Renly,Robert,?
3357,Renly,Robert,A boar.
3358,Eddard,Renly,"A devil,My own fault."
3359,Eddard,Renly,Missed my thrust.And where were the rest of you?
3360,Eddard,Renly,Where was Ser Barristan and the Kingsguard?
3361,Eddard,Renly,My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone.
3362,Eddard,Robert,"Stinks,The stink of death, dont think I cant smell it."
3363,Eddard,Robert,"I paid him back in kind, Eddard."
3364,Renly,Robert,Drove a knife right through his eye.
3365,Renly,Robert,"Ask them.Truly,We brought the carcass back with us, at my brothers command.For the feast,Now leave us."
3366,Renly,Robert,"I need to speak with Eddard.Robert, my sweet lord Cersei began.I said leave,What part of that dont you understand, woman?"
3367,Pycelle,Robert,"The milk of the poppy, Your Grace,Drink.For your pain."
3368,Pycelle,Robert,Away with you.
3369,Eddard,Pycelle,Get out.
3370,Eddard,Pycelle,"Damn you, Robert,"
3371,Gregor,Robar,"Why do you always have to be so headstrong?Ah, fuck you, Eddard,I killed the bastard, didnt IT A lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at Eddard.Ought to do the same for you."
3372,Gregor,Robar,Let Cersei surprise him.
3373,Daenerys,Gregor,"Gods have mercy,The girl."
3374,Petyr,Varys,.
3375,Petyr,Varys,"Wrong, it was wrong, I ."
3376,Eddard,Petyr,.
3377,Eddard,Petyr,Paper and ink.
3378,Eddard,Petyr,Write what I tell you.
3379,Eddard,Joffrey,"At your command, Your Grace.This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and all the rest-put in the damn titles, you know how it goes."
3380,Joffrey,Robert,"Robert Joffreyirey is not your son, he wanted to say, but the words would not come."
3381,Eddard,Robert,"my son Joffrey,my heir"
3382,Eddard,Robert,What else would you have me say?Say .
3383,Eddard,Robert,"You give it to the council when Im dead.Robert,"
3384,Eddard,Robert,The realm needs you.
3385,Eddard,Robert,You are .
3386,Daenerys,Drogo, he said through his pain.
3387,Aerys,Robert,"Bad as Aerys, the gods spare me.No,not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace."
3388,Aerys,Robert,"At the least, they will say ."
3389,Eddard,Robert,"Are you done with the scribbling?Yes, Your Grace."
3390,Eddard,Robert,"The seal should be witnessed.Serve the boar at my funeral feast,Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp."
3391,Eddard,Lyanna,"Promise me, Eddard.I promise."
3392,Eddard,Lyanna,"The girl,Daenerys."
3393,Eddard,Petyr,better than me.
3394,Eddard,Petyr,"Gods have mercy.They will, my friend,They will."
3395,Eddard,Robert,"Killed by a pig,Ought to laugh, but it hurts too much."
3396,Eddard,Robert,Shall I call them back?
3397,Eddard,Robert,"As you will.Gods, why is it so cold in here?"
3398,Eddard,Pycelle,Now give me something for the pain and let me die.
3399,Eddard,Pycelle,Will I dream?
3400,Eddard,Pycelle,"You will, my lord.Good,I will give Lyanna your love, Eddard.Take care of my children for me."
3401,Gendry,Mya,I shall .
3402,Daenerys,Drogo,
3403,Eddard,Pycelle,"I will do all in my power, my lord, but the wound has mortified."
3404,Eddard,Renly,"I can lessen His Graces suffering, but only the gods can heal him now.How long?"
3405,Eddard,Renly,"By rights, he should be dead already.I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely.My brother was always strong,Not wise, perhaps, but strong."
3406,Eddard,Robert,"He slew the boar.His entrails were sliding from his belly, yet somehow he slew the boar."
3407,Barristan,Eddard,"Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing,"
3408,Barristan,Eddard,"Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy,See that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me. It shall be as you command, my lord."
3409,Barristan,Eddard,"I have failed my sacred trust.Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself,Robert loved to hunt boar.I have seen him take a thousand of them."
3410,Barristan,Eddard,"No one could know this one would be his death.You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.The king himself said as much.He blamed the wine."
3411,Barristan,Eddard,"His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair, yet he commanded us all to stand aside. I wonder, Ser Barristan,who gave the king this wine?"
3412,Barristan,Eddard,"The wine was from the kings own skin,Only one skin?Hunting is such thirsty work.I did not keep count."
3413,Barristan,Eddard,"His squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever he required it.Such a dutiful boy,to make certain His Grace did not lack for refreshment."
3414,Barristan,Varys,"Which squire?The elder,Lancel.I know the lad well,A stalwart boy, Ser Kevan Lannisters son, nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen."
3415,Eddard,Varys,"Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth, how well do I remember."
3416,Eddard,Robert,You mention children.
3417,Daenerys,Varys,"At once.Alas,At once may be too late."
3418,Cayn,Varys,With your leave.
3419,Eddard,Maegor,"Lord Eddard,a moment, if you would be so kind."
3420,Eddard,Renly,As you wish.
3421,Eddard,Renly,Send your men away.
3422,Boros,Renly,That letter.
3423,Boros,Renly,Was it the regency?Has my brother named you Protector?
3424,Boros,Renly,"My lord, I have thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and lords.Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.And what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?Strike!Now, while the castle sleeps."
3425,Boros,Renly,We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand.
3426,Cersei,Eddard,The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward.
3427,Eddard,Renly,Robert is not dead yet.
3428,Eddard,Renly,"If not, I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession, but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds."
3429,Renly,Robert,Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
3430,Renly,Robert,"for both of us.Then we should pray that Robert does not die.Small chance of that,Sometimes the gods are merciful.The Lannisters are not."
3431,Cayn,Renly,"I want Petyr,If hes not in his chambers, take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in Kings Landing until you find him.Bring him to me before break of day."
3432,Eddard,Tomard,"The Wind Witch sails on   the evening tide.Have you chosen the escort?Ten men, with Porther in command.Twenty, and you will command,"
3433,Eddard,Tomard,"As you wish, mlord,Cant say Ill be sad to see the back of this place.I miss the wife.You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north.I need you to deliver a letter for me."
3434,Eddard,Stannis,"To Dragonstone, mlord?"
3435,Stannis,Tomard,Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island.
3436,Stannis,Tomard,"Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself.As you command, mord."
3437,Eddard,Petyr,"I suppose congratulations are in order,"
3438,Eddard,Petyr,"The king lies wounded and near to death.I know,I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm."
3439,Catelyn,Eddard,"And how is it you know that, my lord?Varys hinted as much,and you have just confirmed it."
3440,Catelyn,Eddard,Damn Varys and his little birds.
3441,Catelyn,Petyr,I do not trust him.Excellent.Youre learning.
3442,Eddard,Petyr,"Yet Ill wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch.No,I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect."
3443,Petyr,Robert,"Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannisters bastards, born of his incestuous union with the queen."
3444,Petyr,Robert,"Shocking,The girl as well?"
3445,Petyr,Stannis,".The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Roberts two brothers."
3446,Petyr,Stannis,So it would seem.
3447,Petyr,Stannis,".Unless, my lord?"
3448,Eddard,Stannis,"Nothing can change that. Stannis cannot take the throne without your help.If youre wise, youll make certain Joffrey succeeds."
3449,Eddard,Petyr,"Have you no shred of honor?Oh, a shred, surely,Hear me out."
3450,Joffrey,Robert,Now look at the other side of the coin.
3451,Eddard,Stannis,"Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne.We?"
3452,Eddard,Petyr,"Youll need someone to share your burdens.I assure you, my price would be modest.Your price."
3453,Eddard,Jory,"Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason.Only if we lose.You forget,You forget Jon Arryn."
3454,Eddard,Jory,And you forget this.
3455,Eddard,Petyr,"They sent a man to cut my sons throat, Lord Baelish."
3456,Eddard,Petyr,"I fear I did forget, my lord."
3457,Eddard,Petyr,For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark.
3458,Eddard,Petyr,"So it will be Stannis, and war?It is not a choice.Stannis is the heir.Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector."
3459,Eddard,Robert,"Not my wisdom, for a certainty.I shall do my best to forget your ."
3460,Daenerys,Drogo, Eddard said with distaste.
3461,Petyr,Yohn,"And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for Kings Landing even as we speak, with a Lannister host at his back.And you without an army."
3462,Balon,Yohn,There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters.
3463,Loras,Tanda,"each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court.Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer."
3464,Petyr,Tanda,"The City   Watch is two thousand strong, sworn to defend the castle, the city, and the kings peace.Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they protect?"
3465,Eddard,Petyr,"Why, theres your answer,They follow the man who pays them."
3466,Eddard,Petyr,"You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark."
3467,Eddard,Petyr,"but its not honorable, so the words stick in your throat."
3468,Catelyn,Petyr,"I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel ."
3469,Eddard,Janos,"We might be able to buy them for half that much, but I prefer not to take chances."
3470,Jon,Samwell,"Ive been summoned to the sept,Theyre passing me out of training."
3471,Aemon,Samwell,"Can you believe it?No, truly?Truly."
3472,Jon,Samwell,"He needs someone who can read and write letters.Youll do well at that,"
3473,Jon,Samwell,"Is it time to go?I shouldnt be late, they might change their minds."
3474,Benjen,Ryk,"You came to us outlaws,"
3475,Benjen,Ryk,"At evenfall, as the sun sets and we face the gathering night, you shall take your vows."
3476,Eddison,Mag,A man of the Nights Watch lives his life for the realm.
3477,Grenn,Jon,You have learned the words of the vow.
3478,Grenn,Jon,The penalty for desertion is death.Are there any among you who wish to leave our company?
3479,Grenn,Jon,"Well and good,You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order.Do any of you keep to the old gods?"
3480,Grenn,Jon,"I do, my lord.I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did,Yes, my lord,"
3481,Grenn,Jon,Theres no godswood here.
3482,Grenn,Jon,"I never saw a godswood.You wouldnt see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,I would so,Id see them a long way off."
3483,Grenn,Jon,Castle Black has no need of a godswood.
3484,Jon,Samwell,"You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your   gods as well.My lord."
3485,Jon,Samwell,Might I .
3486,Jon,Samwell,To say my words at this heart tree?Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?
3487,Jon,Samwell,"No, my lord,"
3488,Jaremy,Ryk,"I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years.Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?"
3489,Ryk,Samwell,"The Nights Watch is my House now,The Seven have never answered my prayers.Perhaps the old gods will.As you wish, boy,"
3490,Bowen,Jon,"We have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills."
3491,Albett,Bowen,"Haider, to the builders,"
3492,Albett,Jon,"Grenn, to the rangers."
3493,Albett,Jon,"Pypar, to the rangers."
3494,Jon,Samwell,"Samwell, to the stewards."
3495,Dareon,Samwell,"Matthar, to the rangers."
3496,Dareon,Jon,"Jon, to the stewards."
3497,Alliser,Jon,"Your firsts will instruct you in your duties.May all the gods preserve you, brothers."
3498,Jaremy,Ryk,"Rangers with me,"
3499,Jaremy,Othell,"Builders,"
3500,Bowen,Chett,"Samwell, you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library."
3501,Cotter,Jon,"Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lords table and shared their meat and mead."
3502,Cotter,Jon,"We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil were getting has been frightful, Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between ships."
3503,Cotter,Jon,"Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon.Youll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commanders tower.And what will my duties be?"
3504,Aemon,Jon,"Will I serve the Lord Commanders meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?Certainly."
3505,Aemon,Jon,"And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of YOU.Do you take me for a servant?No,We took you for a man of Nights Watch ."
3506,Clydas,Jon,but perhaps we were wrong in that.
3507,Bowen,Dareon,May I go?
3508,Bowen,Dareon,"As you wish,"
3509,Jon,Samwell,"Jon,Wait.Dont you see what theyre doing?"
3510,Dareon,Jon,"I see Ser Allisers bloody hand, thats all I see.He wanted to shame me, and he has."
3511,Dareon,Jon,"The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Samwell but not for Lord Snow.Im a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you,Its notfair!Fair?"
3512,Dareon,Samwell,"The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born.She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair?"
3513,Dareon,Samwell,"There is no shame in being a steward,Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old mans smallclothes?The old man is Lord Commander of the Nights Watch,Youll be with him day and night."
3514,Dick,Samwell,"When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court."
3515,Eddard,Jon,He wants to groom you for command!
3516,Jon,Samwell,"I never asked for this,None of us are here for asking,"
3517,Benjen,Jon,You have the right of it.Then youll stay and say your words with me?The old gods will be expecting us.
3518,Jon,Samwell,The wildlings .
3519,Bowen,Jon,Would they?They never have.
3520,Bowen,Jon,"Do you mean to take that beast?Yes, my lord,"
3521,Bowen,Samwell,"This is a sacred place, we will not defile it."
3522,Jon,Samwell,"Theyre watching us,The old gods.Yes."
3523,Jon,Samwell,"Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow,Night gathers, and now my watch begins."
3524,Bowen,Jon,"I pledge my life and honor to the Nights Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."
3525,Bowen,Jon,"You knelt as boys,Rise now as men of the Nights Watch."
3526,Bowen,Dywen,"Best we be starting back, mlord,Darks falling, and theres something in the smell o the night that I mislike."
3527,Bowen,Jon,Whats he got there?
3528,Bowen,Jon,"To me, Ghost."
3529,Bowen,Jon,Bring it here.
3530,Dywen,Samwell,"Gods be good,Thats a hand."
3531,Arya,Sansa,"Syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening,Can , Father?All my things are packed.A short lesson, and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change.I want you ready to leave by midday, is that understood?By midday,"
3532,Mordane,Sansa,"If she can have a dancing lesson, why wont you let me say farewell to Prince Joffrey?I would gladly go with her, Lord Eddard,There would be no question of her missing the ship.It would not be wise for you to go to Joffrey right now, Sansa.Im sorry."
3533,Mordane,Sansa,"But why?Sansa, your lord father knows best,You are not to question his decisions.Its notfair!"
3534,Eddard,Mordane,"Let her go, Septa.I will try to make her understand when we are all safely back in Winterfell."
3535,Eddard,Robert,"My lord,King Robert is gone. Eddard answered."
3536,Pycelle,Robert,"Be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar,"
3537,Eddard,Pycelle,My lord?
3538,Eddard,Pycelle,"Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow, when our grief is not so fresh."
3539,Eddard,Pycelle,I fear we must convene at once.
3540,Eddard,Pycelle,As the Hand commands.
3541,Eddard,Petyr,"My lords,my place is beside the young king now."
3542,Eddard,Varys,"My lords,That little task you set me is accomplished, Lord Eddard."
3543,Eddard,Varys,"The little birds sing a grievous song today,The realm weeps.Shall we begin?When Lord Renly arrives,"
3544,Eddard,Varys,I fear Lord Renly has left the city.Left the city?
3545,Renly,Varys,"He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn, accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers,When last seen, they were galloping south in some haste, no doubt bound for Storms End or Highgarden."
3546,Renly,Robert,The king called me to his side last night and commanded me to record his final words.
3547,Pycelle,Robert,"Ser Barristan, if you would be so kind?"
3548,Eddard,Robert,"King Roberts seal, and unbroken."
3549,Eddard,Pycelle,"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as regent until the heir comes of age."
3550,Eddard,Stannis,"I would ask this council to confirm me as Lord Protector, as Robert wished,"
3551,Eddard,Varys,"Pardon, my lords, the kings steward insists ."
3552,Eddard,Varys,.
3553,Cersei,Eddard,"Esteemed lords, the king demands the immediate presence of his small council in the throne room."
3554,Cersei,Petyr,"The king is dead,but we shall go with you nonetheless."
3555,Joffrey,Petyr,"All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,"
3556,Eddard,Robert,"I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation,I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors."
3557,Eddard,Robert,"Lord Varys, be so kind as to show this to my lady of Lannister."
3558,Cersei,Robert,"Protector of the Realm,Is this meant to be your shield, my lord?A piece of paper?"
3559,Barristan,Cersei,"Those were the kings words,We have a new king now,Lord Eddard, when last we spoke, you gave me some counsel."
3560,Cersei,Eddard,"Bend the knee and swear fealty to my son, and we shall allow you to step down as Hand and live out your days in the grey waste you call home.Would that I could,"
3561,Joffrey,Myrcella,Your son has no claim to the throne he sits.Lord Stannis is Roberts true heir.Liar!
3562,Joffrey,Myrcella,"Mother, what does he mean?"
3563,Cersei,Myrcella,"Isnt Joffrey the king now?You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark,Ser Barristan, seize this traitor."
3564,Cersei,Myrcella,"And now the treason moves from words to deeds,Do you think Ser Barristan stands alone, my lord?"
3565,Cersei,Eddard,Kill him!
3566,Cersei,Eddard,"Kill all of them, I command it!You leave me no choice,"
3567,Cersei,Janos,"Commander, take the queen and her children into custody.Do them no harm, but escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.Men of the Watch!"
3568,Eddard,Janos,"I want no bloodshed,Tell your men to lay down their swords, and no one need-"
3569,Eddard,Petyr,"I did warn you not to trust me, you know."
3570,Arya,Syrio,"High,"
3571,Arya,Syrio,"Left,"
3572,Arya,Syrio,"Right,Low,Left,Left"
3573,Arya,Syrio,"Lunge,"
3574,Small,Syrio,"Left,Low."
3575,Small,Syrio,Left.
3576,Small,Syrio,Left!
3577,Arya,Syrio,Owl 
3578,Arya,Syrio,You are dead now.
3579,Arya,Syrio,"You cheated,You said left and you went right.Just so.And now you are a dead girl.But you lied!My words lied.My eyes and my arm shouted out the truth, but you were not seeing.I was so,I watched you every second!Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
3580,Arya,Syrio,"Come, put down the sword, it is time for listening now."
3581,Arya,Syrio,"Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, and are you knowing how that came to pass?You were the finest swordsman in the city.Just so, but why?"
3582,Arya,Syrio,I will tell you now.
3583,Arya,Syrio,"The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of it.Hear me."
3584,Arya,Syrio,"On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for me."
3585,Arya,Syrio,"And to him I said, Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him, and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword."
3586,Arya,Syrio,I dont understand.
3587,Arya,Syrio,"The cat was an ordinary cat, no more."
3588,Arya,Syrio,Are you hearing?
3589,Arya,Syrio,You saw what was there.Just so.
3590,Arya,Syrio,"Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.Just so,"
3591,Arya,Syrio,"I am thinking that when we are reaching this Winterfell of yours, it will be time to put this needle in your hand.Yes!"
3592,Arya,Small,Wait till I show Jon-
3593,Arya,Syrio,"Arya Stark,come with us, child."
3594,Arya,Syrio,What do you want?Your father wants to see you.
3595,Meryn,Syrio,"And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own?I am wondering.Mind your place, dancing master,This is no concern of yours.My father wouldnt send you,"
3596,Arya,Meryn,"Put down the stick, girl,I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, the White Swords.So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king,I dont have to go with you if I dont want."
3597,Arya,Meryn,"Take her,"
3598,Arya,Syrio,"You will be stopping there.Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child?Out of the way, old man,"
3599,Arya,Syrio,"I am Syrio Forel, and you will now be speaking to me with more respect.Bald bastard."
3600,Arya,Meryn,"My hand,You are quick, for a dancing master,You are slow, for a knight,Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,"
3601,Arya,Syrio,"Arya child,"
3602,Arya,Syrio,Run to your father.
3603,Arya,Syrio,"Swift as a deer, Just so,"
3604,Meryn,Syrio,"Bloody oafs,"
3605,Meryn,Syrio,"Arya child,be gone now."
3606,Meryn,Syrio,"Syrio, run,The first sword of Braavos does not run,"
3607,Arya,Eddison,"No, "
3608,Heward,Syrio,"Fear cuts deeper than swords, "
3609,Arya,Hullen,"Arya Underfoot,You must ."
3610,Arya,Hullen,.
3611,Arya,Desmond,You liar!
3612,Arya,Eddison,"There she is,"
3613,Arya,Syrio,Who are you?
3614,Arya,Syrio,"She dont know me,but I knows her, oh, yes. Arya pleaded, reaching back into the chest, groping for Needle."
3615,Arya,Syrio,"Its the queen wholl be rewarding me.Come here, girl.Stay away!"
3616,Arya,Syrio,"I says, come."
3617,Arya,Jon,"Oh, gods,Take it out."
3618,Arya,Hot,"Dragons, "
3619,Bran,Robb,"There are worse things than spiders and rats,This is where the dead walk."
3620,Jon,Robb,"You stupid,you scared the baby,"
3621,Jeyne,Sansa,"Im certain your father is well,Ill ask the queen to let you see him."
3622,Jeyne,Sandor,"Theyre killing everyone, "
3623,Joffrey,Sansa,"Please, I need to speak to the queen again,Shell want to talk to me, I know she will."
3624,Joffrey,Sansa,Were to marry when were older.
3625,Jeyne,Sansa,What is it?
3626,Jeyne,Sansa,Why are they ringing the bells?The king is dead.
3627,Boros,Sansa,"You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros,"
3628,Boros,Sansa,"And you, my lady,Her Grace awaits.Come with me."
3629,Cersei,Sansa,"To keep you safe, my sweet one,Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious."
3630,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your Grace,Ive brought the girl."
3631,Cersei,Sansa,"Sansa, my sweet child,"
3632,Cersei,Sansa,"I trust my people have been taking good care of you?Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for asking,Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us whats happened "
3633,Boros,Cersei,"We put the stewards girl in with her,We did not know what else to do with her."
3634,Boros,Sansa,"Next time, you will ask,The gods only know what sort of tales shes been filling Sansas head with.Jeynes scared,She wont stop crying.I promised her Id ask if she could see her father."
3635,Pycelle,Sansa,"Her father is well, isnt he?"
3636,Cersei,Petyr,"I wont have Sansa fretting needlessly.What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?"
3637,Cersei,Petyr,"Ill find a place for her.Not in the city,Do you take me for a fool?"
3638,Boros,Petyr,"Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyrs apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her."
3639,Boros,Petyr,"I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber.As you command, Your Grace,"
3640,Boros,Sansa,"I dont understand,Where is Jeynes father?Why cant Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?"
3641,Catelyn,Sansa,"Where are you sending her?She hasnt done anything wrong, shes a good girl.Shes upset you,We cant be having that."
3642,Cersei,Sansa,"Lord Baelish will see that Jeynes well taken care of, I promise you."
3643,Cersei,Sansa,"Sit down, Sansa.I want to talk to you."
3644,Cersei,Sansa,"Sweet Sansa,Such a beautiful child.I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you.You do?"
3645,Petyr,Sansa,I think of you almost as my own daughter.And I know the love you bear for Joffrey.
3646,Sansa,Varys,"I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father.You must be brave, child."
3647,Sansa,Varys,"What is it?Your father is a traitor, dear,"
3648,Pycelle,Sansa,"With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons.And yet the moment the king was dead, he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffreys rightful throne.No,He wouldnt do that.He wouldnt!"
3649,Pycelle,Sansa,"We found this on the captain of your household guard, Sansa.It is a letter to my late husbands brother Stannis, inviting him to take the crown.Please, Your Grace, theres been a mistake."
3650,Pycelle,Sansa,"Please, send for my father, hell tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was his friend.Robert thought so,This betrayal would have broken his heart.The gods are kind, that he did not live to see it."
3651,Joffrey,Sansa,"Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in."
3652,Joffrey,Sansa,"How   can I allow you to marry my son?But I love him,"
3653,Cersei,Sansa,"How well I know that, child,Why else should you have come to me and told me of your fathers plan to send you away from us, if not for love?It was for love,Father wouldnt even give me leave to say farewell."
3654,Joffrey,Sansa,"He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joffrey I wanted.I told him, but he wouldnt listen."
3655,Joffrey,Maegor,"Please,you have to let me marry Joffrey, Ill be ever so good a wife to him, youll see."
3656,Cersei,Varys,"My lords of the council, what do you say to her plea?The poor child,A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, it would be cruel to deny it ."
3657,Cersei,Varys,Her father stands condemned.
3658,Pycelle,Sansa,"A child born of traitors seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her,She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can say what treasons she may hatch?No, Im not, Id never ."
3659,Sansa,Varys,"I wouldnt betray Joffrey, I love him, I swear it, I do.Oh, so poignant,And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths.She reminds me of the mother, not the father,Look at her."
3660,Petyr,Sansa,She is the very image of Cat at the same age.
3661,Joffrey,Sansa,"Child,if I could truly believe that you were not like your father, why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey."
3662,Joffrey,Sansa,"And yet, I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it."
3663,Joffrey,Sansa,"I have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son.Im not like Arya,She has the traitors blood, not me.Im good, ask Septa Mordane,   shell tell you, I only want to be Joffreys loyal and loving wife."
3664,Cersei,Pycelle,"I believe you mean it, child."
3665,Cersei,Pycelle,"My lords, it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time, that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest."
3666,Petyr,Sansa,"Lord Eddard has three sons.Mere boys,I should be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the Tullys."
3667,Petyr,Sansa,"Child, do you know your letters?"
3668,Joffrey,Sansa,I am pleased to hear that.
3669,Joffrey,Sansa,".What do you want me to do?You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldest ."
3670,Joffrey,Sansa,"what is his name?Robb,The word of your lord fathers treason will no doubt reach them soon."
3671,Joffrey,Sansa,You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king.
3672,Joffrey,Sansa,But he never .
3673,Joffrey,Pycelle,.
3674,Joffrey,Pycelle,"We will tell you what to write, child.The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the kings peace.It will go hard for them if they dont,By the love you bear them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom.Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully,You must tell her that you are well and in our care, that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want."
3675,Joffrey,Sansa,"why, then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood, and when you come into the flower of your womanhood, you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor, before the eyes of gods and men."
3676,Sansa,Varys,Perhaps .
3677,Sansa,Varys,.Treason?
3678,Sansa,Varys,"You disappoint me, Sansa,Weve told you of your fathers crimes.If you are truly as loyal as you say, why should you want to see him?I ."
3679,Eddard,Sansa,Hes not .
3680,Daenerys,Drogo,
3681,Eddard,Pycelle,"whats to become of him?That is a matter for the king to decide,"
3682,Cersei,Sansa,Ill .
3683,Catelyn,Cersei,I knew you would.Joffrey will be so proud when I tell him what courage and good sense youve shown here today.
3684,Jon,Sansa,"Othor,beyond a doubt."
3685,Aemon,Jon,"They were Ben Starks men, both of them."
3686,Aemon,Jon,"Gods have mercy,"
3687,Jon,Samwell,"I cant look,You have to look,Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didnt he?What good are eyes if theyre shut?Yes, but ."
3688,Jon,Samwell,"Im such a coward, Jon."
3689,Jon,Samwell,"We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost."
3690,Jon,Samwell,The first look is the hardest.
3691,Jaremy,Jon,"Ser Jaremy,Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall."
3692,Jaremy,Jon,Would that I knew.
3693,Jaremy,Jon,"Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing."
3694,Jaremy,Jon,"Do we still sweep these woods?Yes, my lord, but-Do we still mount watches?We do, but-This man wears a hunting horn."
3695,Jaremy,Jon,Must I suppose that he died without sounding it?Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?
3696,Jaremy,Jon,"No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it."
3697,Jaremy,Jon,"and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command."
3698,Jaremy,Jon,Yes.
3699,Dywen,Jaremy,Be that as it may.
3700,Dywen,Jaremy,Tell me how they died.
3701,Dywen,Jon,"This was done with an axe.Aye,Belike the axe that Othor carried, mlord."
3702,Jaremy,Jon,The wildlings have axes too.
3703,Jaremy,Jon,"So you believe this is Mance Rayders work?This close to the Wall?Who else, my lord?"
3704,Arya,Jaremy,"If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half days ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads.Unless he was slain as well,"
3705,Jaremy,Jon,"It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord,The forest is vast."
3706,Jon,Samwell,"No, "
3707,Jaremy,Ryk,"I did not ask for your views, boy,Let him speak, ser,"
3708,Jon,Samwell,"If the lad has something to say, Ill hear him out."
3709,Jon,Samwell,We cant see you behind those horses.
3710,Jon,Samwell,"My lord, it ."

3720,Jon,Samwell,. 
3721,Dywen,Ryk,"If theyd been dead much longer than a day, theyd be ripe by now, boy.They dont even smell."
3722,Dywen,Samwell,"Well, theyre no pansy flowers, but ... mlord has the truth of it.Theres no corpse stink.They ."
3723,Dywen,Samwell,they arent rotting.
3724,Dywen,Samwell,"Look, theres ."
3725,Chett,Jon,".Untouched,And Ghost is different.The dogs and the horses wont go near them."
3726,Chett,Jon,"Chett, bring the hounds closer."
3727,Chett,Samwell,This .
3728,Daenerys,Drogo, SamwellTarly said earnestly.
3729,Dywen,Samwell,.
3730,Dywen,Samwell,With those wounds .
3731,Dywen,Samwell,Shouldnt there?
3732,Dywen,Jaremy,Might be they didnt die here.
3733,Dywen,Jaremy,"A warning, as like."
3734,Dywen,Jaremy,"And might be Im a fool, but I dont know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore."
3735,Dywen,Jaremy,"Neither did Flowers,"
3736,Dywen,Jon,"Bum them, "
3737,Aemon,Jon,"Yes, burn them,"
3738,Aemon,Jon,Not yet.
3739,Aemon,Dywen,Well bring them back to the Wall.
3740,Dywen,Jaremy,"I will have these woods searched,Every tree,   every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here."
3741,Jaremy,Jon,"Is that understood?It is, my lord,It will be done."
3742,Jon,Samwell,"Tarly,come here."
3743,Jon,Samwell,"Youre fat but youre not stupid, boy,You did well back there.And you, Snow."
3744,Bowen,Jon,"My lord,theres been a bird, you must come at once.What is it, man?"
3745,Alliser,Jon,"Maester Aemon has the letter.Hes waiting in your solar.Very well.Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them."
3746,Donal,Jon,"The gods be with you, Snow,"
3747,Jon,Robert,Whats happened?
3748,Jon,Robert,The kings dead.
3749,Joffrey,Jon,How can you know?One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon.
3750,Joffrey,Jon,"Jon, Im sorry.He was your fathers friend, wasnt he?They were as close as brothers, once."
3751,Arya,Jon,"I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncles,Yes,Two of the six he took with him."
3752,Arya,Jon,the bodies are queer.Queer?
3753,Arya,Jon,How queer?Samwellwill tell you.
3754,Arya,Jon,I should see if the Old Bear has need of me.
3755,Arya,Jon,"The Old Bears in his solar,He was asking for you."
3756,Eddison,Jon,Corn!
3757,Eddison,Jon,Corn!
3758,Eddison,Jon,"Corn!Dont you believe it, I just fed him,"
3759,Eddison,Jon,"Bring me a cup of wine, and pour one for yourself.For myself, my lord?"
3760,Eddison,Jon,You heard me.
3761,Eddison,Jon,"Sit, boy,Drink."
3762,Eddison,Jon,"Its my father, isnt it?"
3763,Eddison,Jon,"Your father and the king,I wont lie to you, its grievous news.I never thought to see another king, not at my age, with Robert half my years and strong as a bull."
3764,Eddard,Jon,They say the king loved to hunt.
3765,Eddard,Jon,"If not for her, he would never have thought to sell those poachers."
3766,Eddard,Jon,"My lord, I dont understand.Whats happened to my father?I told you to sit,Sit, And have a drink, damn you.Thats a command, Snow."
3767,Eddard,Jon,Lord Eddard has been imprisoned.
3768,Eddard,Jon,"It is said he plotted with Roberts brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.No,That couldnt be.My father would never betray the king!Be that as it may,It is not for me to say.But its a lie,"
3769,Pycelle,Stannis,"My lord, what will happen to him?Will they kill him?As to that, I cannot say, lad."
3770,Barristan,Jon,"Gods knows, we need men of Lord Eddards ability."
3771,Jon,Rodrik,"My lord, will the king listen to you?"
3772,Jon,Rodrik,A boy king .
3773,Jon,Tyrion, 
3774,Arya,Sansa,"My lord, what of my sisters? I will ask about them when I write."
3775,Jon,Pycelle,This could not have happened at a worse time.
3776,Jon,Pycelle,.
3777,Jon,Pycelle,"I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid, boy."
3778,Jon,Pycelle,"Your duty is here now,Your old life ended when you took the black."
3779,Jon,Pycelle,Black. 
3780,Eddison,Jon,Whatever they do in Kings Landing is none of our concern.
3781,Eddison,Jon,On the morrow you can help me write that letter.
3782,Daenerys,Drogo,"Be strong, boy."
3783,Eddison,Jon,"My father is no traitor,"
3784,Grenn,Samwell,"We asked the septon to light a candle for your father,Its a lie, we all know its a lie, even Grenn knows its a lie,Youre my brother now, so hes my father too,If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods, Ill go with you."
3785,Alliser,Jon,"Not only a bastard, but a traitors bastard,"
3786,Grenn,Jon,"I told you not to do anything stupid, boy,Boy, "
3787,Grenn,Jon,And to think I had high hopes for you.

3790,Eddison,Jon,"Its me, Ghost,"
3791,Eddison,Jon,"Theres someone out there, isnt there?"
3792,Eddison,Jon,"Corn, Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn. "

3799,Eddison,Jon,Ghost!
3800,Bran,Robb,"We have no men to spare to guard you,Ill take Summer,Dont act the boy with me, Bran,You know better than that."
3801,Bran,Robb,Our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk.
3802,Bran,Luwin,How many is it now?
3803,Bran,Luwin,"Twelve thousand men, or near enough as makes no matter.How many knights?Few enough,To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows."
3804,Bran,Luwin,"As I have told you a hundred times before.Still,how many knights?"
3805,Bran,Luwin,"Three hundred, perhaps four ."
3806,Bran,Luwin,"among three thousand armored lances who are not knights.Lord Karstark is the last,Robb will feast him tonight.No doubt he will.How long before ."
3807,Bran,Luwin,"before they go?He must march soon, or not at all,The winter town is full to bursting, and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer."
3808,Bran,Luwin,"The fighting has begun in the riverlands, and your brother has many leagues to go.I know."
3809,Hodor,Luwin,"I dont want to watch anymore.Hodor, take me back to the keep.Hodor,"
3810,Hodor,Luwin,"Bran, your lord brother will not have time to see you now.He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome.I wont trouble Robb.I want to visit the godswood."
3811,Hodor,Luwin,Hodor.
3812,Bran,Luwin,"Men will look at you,They will look, and they will talk, and some will mock you."
3813,Bran,Hodor,"The godswood,"
3814,Bran,Hodor,"I want to be by myself for a while,You go soak.Go to the pools.Hodor."
3815,Bran,Robb,"Please make it so Robb wont go away,"
3816,Bran,Robb,Please make him stay.
3817,Nan,Robb,make it so Rickon understands.
3818,Daenerys,Drogo,I dont want to go.
3819,Luwin,Robb,"My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell,"
3820,Greatjon,Robb,"And when we are done with the Lannisters,we will march back north, root you out of your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker."
3821,Bran,Greatjon,"My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord,but doubtless you only meant to cut my meat."
3822,Greatjon,Robb,"Your meat,is bloody tough. "
3823,Greatjon,Robb,"I thought he was going to kill me,Did you see the way he threw down Hal, like he was no bigger than Rickon?"
3824,Bran,Greatjon,"Lord Roose never says a word, he only looks at me, and all I can think of is that room they have in the Dreadfort, where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies.Thats just one of Old Nans stories,"
3825,Bran,Theon,Isnt it?I dont know.
3826,Bran,Theon,Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south with us.
3827,Bran,Rickon,.
3828,Robb,Sansa,"She says Father conspired at treason with the kings brothers,King Robert is dead, and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey.She says we must be loyal, and when she marries Joffreytey she will plead with him to spare our lord fathers life."
3829,Bran,Sansa,"And she says nothing of Arya, nothing, not so much as a word."
3830,Bran,Sansa,Whats wrong with the girl?
3831,Bran,Sansa,"She lost her wolf,"
3832,Bran,Theon,"If Robb has to go, watch over him,"
3833,Bran,Theon,Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home.
3834,Bran,Osha,"You hear them, boy?"
3835,Bran,Osha,"Summer, to me,"
3836,Bran,Osha,What are you doing here?
3837,Bran,Osha,"They are my gods too,Beyond the Wall, they are the only gods."
3838,Bran,Osha,"Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, when I feel the need, and I let him do as he likes under my skirt, when he feels the need."
3839,Bran,Osha,"I like the smell of flour on his hands, and hes gentler than Stiv."
3840,Bran,Osha,"Ill leave you.Theres pots that want scouring.No, stay,Tell me what you meant, about hearing the gods."
3841,Bran,Osha,"You asked them and theyre answering.Open your ears, listen, youll hear."
3842,Bran,Osha,"Its only the wind,The leaves are rustling.Who do you think sends the wind, if not the gods?"
3843,Bran,Mikken,"They see you, boy."
3844,Bran,Mikken,"That rustling, thats them talking back.:What are they saying?"
3845,Bran,Osha,How can they watch your brother when they have no eyes?
3846,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor!He must have heard our voices,Hodor, you forgot your clothes.Hodor,"
3847,Hodor,Osha,"Now theres a big man,He has giants blood in him, or Im the queen.Maester Luwin says there are no more giants."
3848,Hodor,Osha,"All thats left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time.Let Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall,Hell find giants then, or theyll find him."
3849,Bran,Hodor,The men are so big theyll rip a maid apart before they get her with child.
3850,Bran,Hodor,"But you dont know what I mean, do you, boy?Yes I do,"
3851,Bran,Hodor,"Go back and bring your clothes, Hodor,Go dress.Hodor."
3852,Bran,Osha,Are there truly giants beyond the Wall?
3853,Bran,Osha,"Giants and worse than giants, Lordling."
3854,Greatjon,Osha,We remember.
3855,Greatjon,Osha,I tried to tell your lordling brother.
3856,Bran,Greatjon,"A man who wont listen cant hear.Tell me.Robb will listen to me, I know he will.Will he now?"
3857,Bran,Robb,You hear me?
3858,Bran,Robb,Ill tell him.
3859,Bran,Rickard,"My lords,Brandon Stark, of Winterfell.I welcome you to our fires,and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship."
3860,Daenerys,Drogo,
3861,Bran,Luwin,"I dont want to be broken,I want to be a knight.There are some who call my order the knights of the mind,You are a surpassing clever boy when you work at it, Bran."
3862,Bran,Luwin,"There is   no limit to what you might learn.I want to learn magic,The crow promised that I would fly."
3863,Bran,Luwin,"I can teach you history, healing, herblore."
3864,Bran,Osha,"But, Bran, no man can teach you magic.The children could,The children of the forest."
3865,Bran,Luwin,"The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales, I think,I will talk with her again if you like, but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this folly."
3866,Bran,Luwin,"Its the Lannisters who hold your lord father, Bran, not the children of the forest."
3867,Bran,Robb,"Think on what I said, child."
3868,Bran,Robb,"You are the lord in Winterfell now,"
3869,Bran,Rickon,"You must take my place, as I took Fathers, until we come home.I know,"
3870,Bran,Rickon,"Listen to Maester Luwins counsel, and take care of Rickon.Tell him that Ill be back as soon as the fighting is done."
3871,Bran,Rickon,No!
3872,Bran,Robb,"NO farewell!I told him,He says no one ever comes back.He cant be a baby forever.Hes a Stark, and near four."
3873,Bran,Robb,"Well, Mother will be home soon.And Ill bring back Father, I promise."
3874,Bran,Hodor,Hodor?
3875,Bran,Hodor,"Hodor,"
3876,Daenerys,Drogo,The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs.
3877,Daenerys,Drogo,"It was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth,The earth ends at the black salt sea,"
3878,Daenerys,Drogo,"No horse can cross the poison water.In the Free Cities, there are ships by the thousand,Wooden horses with a hundred legs, that fly across the sea on wings full of wind."
3879,Daenerys,Drogo,We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
3880,Daenerys,Drogo,"This day I will go to the grass and hunt, woman wife,Yes, my sun-and-stars,"
3881,Daenerys,Jorah,"My princess.How may I serve you?You must talk to my lord husband,Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule, and no need to cross the poison water.He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born, to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea."
3882,Daenerys,Jorah,"The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms,They are nothing to him."
3883,Daenerys,Drogo,"The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect.But he must ride west,Please, help me make him understand."
3884,Jorah,Viserys,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons,Have patience, Princess."
3885,Jorah,Viserys,"We will go home, I promise you."
3886,Illyrio,Jorah,"A great caravan arrived during the night, Khaleesi."
3887,Daenerys,Illyrio,Would you care to visit the Western Market?
3888,Daenerys,Illyrio,"Yes,I would like that."
3889,Drogo,Jorah,"Irri, have them prepare a litter.,, "
3890,Daenerys,Jorah,"When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,It was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, so many wonderful things to look at ."
3891,Daenerys,Jorah,"do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?Cakes, are they?I could not say, Princess."
3892,Daenerys,Jorah,"If you would pardon me for a time, I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us.Very well.Ill help you find him.There is no need for you to trouble yourself."
3893,Daenerys,Jorah,Enjoy the market.I will rejoin you when my business is concluded.
3894,Daenerys,Jorah,"Come,"
3895,Daenerys,Jorah,"Oh, look,those are the kind of sausages I meant."
3896,Daenerys,Quaro,They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers.
3897,Daenerys,Quaro,"They taste different than I remember,In Pentos, I make them with pork,but all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea."
3898,Daenerys,Irri,"You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo,It is good to see, Khaleesi."
3899,Irri,Jhiqui,"Sweet reds,"
3900,Daenerys,Jhiqui,"Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have them, I have them."
3901,Daenerys,Jhiqui,A taste for the khaleesi?
3902,Daenerys,Doreah,"One taste, and you will name your child after me."
3903,Daenerys,Doreah,"My son has his name, but I will try your summerwine,"
3904,Daenerys,Doreah,"Just a taste, if you would be so kind."
3905,Daenerys,Doreah,"My lady, you are ."
3906,Daenerys,Doreah,"Can it be so?My speech may be Tyroshi, and my garb Dothraki, but I am of Westeros, of the Sunset Kingdoms,"
3907,Daenerys,Doreah,"You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Daenerys Stormborn, khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms."
3908,Daenerys,Doreah,"Princess,Rise,I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of."
3909,Daenerys,Drogo,That?
3910,Daenerys,Drogo,"Please, let me give you a cask."
3911,Daenerys,Drogo,"You honor me, ser,The honor is mine."
3912,Daenerys,Jorah,"The Redwyne sigil,for the Arbor."
3913,Aggo,Jorah,No. 
3914,Aggo,Daenerys,"Aggo, put down that cask."
3915,Aggo,Daenerys,"Ser Jorah, is something wrong?I have a thirst.Open it, wineseller."
3916,Daenerys,Jorah,"The wine is for the khaleesi, not for the likes of you, ser."
3917,Daenerys,Jorah,"If you dont open it, Ill crack it open with your head."
3918,Daenerys,Jorah,"Pour,"
3919,Daenerys,Jhogo,It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe.
3920,Daenerys,Jhogo,"Do as Ser Jorah says,"
3921,Daenerys,Jorah,As the princess commands.
3922,Daenerys,Jorah,"Sweet, isnt it?"
3923,Daenerys,Jorah,"Can you smell the fruit, ser?"
3924,Daenerys,Jorah,"Taste it, my lord, and tell me it isnt the finest, richest wine thats ever touched your tongue."
3925,Daenerys,Jorah,You taste it first.Me?
3926,Daenerys,Jorah,"I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord.And its a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares."
3927,Daenerys,Jorah,"You will drink,Empty the cup, or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat."
3928,Daenerys,Doreah,"No, "
3929,Doreah,Jhiqui,"Take this one away to await the pleasure of the khal,"
3930,Doreah,Jhiqui,"His goods I gift to you as well, Princess,Small token of regret, that one of mine would do this thing."
3931,Daenerys,Jorah,How did you know?
3932,Daenerys,Jorah,"How?I did not know, Khaleesi, not until the man refused to drink, but once I read Magister Illyrios letter, I feared."
3933,Daenerys,Jorah,Come.Best not to talk of it here.
3934,Daenerys,Jorah,"You are the blood of the dragon, little one,You are the blood of the dragon, and the dragon does not fear."
3935,Daenerys,Jorah,"Tell me,Was it the Usurper?Yes."
3936,Daenerys,Jorah,"A letter to Viserys, from Magister Illyrio.Robert Baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death, or your brothers.My brother?"
3937,Daenerys,Jorah,"He does not know yet, does he?The Usurper owes Drogo a lordship."
3938,Daenerys,Jorah,"And me, you said.Only me?You and the child,No.He cannot have my son."
3939,Daenerys,Jorah,"Ser Jorah, light the brazier.Khaleesi?"
3940,Daenerys,Jorah,It is so hot.Are you certain?
3941,Daenerys,Jorah,Yes.
3942,Daenerys,Jorah,Light the brazier.
3943,Daenerys,Jorah,As you command.
3944,Daenerys,Drogo,"I shall make you a cloak of its skin, moon of my life,"
3945,Daenerys,Drogo,"This poisoner was the first,but he will not be the last."
3946,Daenerys,Drogo,
3947,Jhogo,Jorah,"And to Rhaego son of Drogo, the stallion who will mount the world, to him I also pledge a gift."
3948,Drogo,Jorah,", Drogo, khal, will do this thing."
3949,Drogo,Jorah,"I will take my khalasar west to where the world ends, and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before."
3950,Daenerys,Drogo,"This I swear before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars look down in witness."
3951,Brynden,Catelyn,"They await our coming, my lady,as my lord father swore they would.Let us not keep them waiting any longer, ser."
3952,Catelyn,Wyman,"If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels,"
3953,Catelyn,Wyl,"My boys will see you safe to your son, though, have no fear.boys"
3954,Brynden,Catelyn,"Gods have mercy,This is Moat Cailin?  Catelyn finished."
3955,Brynden,Greatjon,"To assault any of the towers, an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck, cross a moat full of lizard-lions, and scale walls slimy with moss, all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers."
3956,Brynden,Greatjon,"And when night falls, there are said to be ghosts, cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood."
3957,Brynden,Greatjon,"Remind me not to linger here.Last I looked, I was southron myself."
3958,Catelyn,Robb,Mother?
3959,Catelyn,Robb,"Youve grown a beard,"
3960,Catelyn,Robb,Yes.
3961,Catelyn,Helman,I like it.
3962,Catelyn,Helman,It makes you look like my brother Edmure.
3963,Galbart,Greatjon,"Lady Catelyn,you are fair as ever, a welcome sight in troubled times."
3964,Greatjon,Theon,"I had not looked to see you here, my lady,I had not thought to be here,until I came ashore at White Harbor, and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners."
3965,Robb,Wendel,"And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my sisters service for mine.The Brynden,Thank you for joining us, ser."
3966,Rodrik,Wendel,Ive missed him.Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor.
3967,Greatjon,Roose,"Maester Luwin is a wise counsellor, but unskilled in the arts of war.Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark,Winterfell is safe.Well shove our swords up Tywin Lannisters bunghole soon enough, begging your pardons, and then its on to the Red Keep to free Eddard.My lady, a question, as it please you."
3968,Catelyn,Roose,It is said that you hold Lord Tywins dwarf son as captive.
3969,Catelyn,Roose,"I vow, we should make good use of such a hostage.I did hold Tyrion Lannister, but no longer,"
3970,Catelyn,Robert,"I was no more pleased than you, my lords.The gods saw fit to free him, with some help from my fool of a sister."
3971,Catelyn,Lysa,"Sister or no,if you try to steal my son, you   will leave by the Moon Door."
3972,Catelyn,Lysa,"No doubt we will have time for all this later, but my journey has fatigued me."
3973,Catelyn,Lysa,"I know you will forgive me, my lords."
3974,Catelyn,Robb,"And you, Theon,"
3975,Robb,Roose,"Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers.I will be sixteen soon enough,And you are fifteen now."
3976,Robb,Roose,"Can you understand why I might fear, Robb?"
3977,Rickard,Roose,There was no one else.No one?
3978,Rickard,Roose,"Pray, who were those men I saw here a moment ago?"
3979,Galbart,Greatjon,"Gods be good, you might even have sent Theon, though he would not be my choice.They are not Starks,They are men, Robb, seasoned in battle.You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past."
3980,Catelyn,Greatjon,"I know,Are you ."
3981,Catelyn,Greatjon,are you sending me back to Winterfell?
3982,Catelyn,Greatjon,I should.
3983,Eddard,Robert,"I will not do that to you, much as I might wish to keep you safe.You have my thanks, Mother,"
3984,Eddard,Robert,"You are my firstborn, Robb.I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world, red-faced and squalling."
3985,Eddard,Robert,You know .
3986,Eddard,Robert,about Father?Yes.
3987,Catelyn,Robb,"Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor.Have you had any word of your sisters?There was a letter,One for you as well, but it came to Winterfell with mine."
3988,Catelyn,Robb,"This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bring yours."
3989,Catelyn,Robb,"This is Cerseis letter, not your sisters,The real message is in what Sansa does not say."
3990,Catelyn,Robb,"They have Sansa hostage, and they mean to keep her.Theres no mention of Arya,No."
3991,Catelyn,Sansa,I had hoped .
3992,Catelyn,Sansa,.
3993,Lysa,Sansa,Is there word from the Eyrie?
3994,Brynden,Lysa,"Will the knights of the Vale come join us?Only one,"
3995,Brynden,Robb,My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.
3996,Brynden,Robb,"Mother, what are we going to do?"
3997,Brynden,Robb,.
3998,Brynden,Robb,"What are you so afraid of, Robb?"
3999,Brynden,Robb,I .
4000,Brynden,Robb,.
4001,Brynden,Robb,"If we march ... even if we win ... the Lannisters hold Sansa, and Father.Theyll kill them, wont they?They want us to think so.You mean theyre lying?I do not know, Robb."
4002,Catelyn,Robb,"Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace, should the fighting go against her.What if the fighting doesnt go against her?"
4003,Catelyn,Robb,What if it goes against us?
4004,Catelyn,Robb,"Robb, I will not soften the truth for you."
4005,Catelyn,Robb,Remember the fate of Rhaegars children.
4006,Catelyn,Robb,"Then I will not lose,Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands,"
4007,Jaime,Robb,"Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth,Uncle Edmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass, but the Kingslayer descended on them and put them to flight."
4008,Jaime,Tywin,"Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, under the kings own banner."
4009,Catelyn,Robb,"Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, its said, and now hes marching north toward Harrenhal, burning as he goes."
4010,Catelyn,Robb,You mean to meet him here?
4011,Catelyn,Robb,"If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will,Ive sent word to Howland Reed, Fathers old friend at Greywater Watch."
4012,Catelyn,Jaime,We need to march south to meet him.
4013,Jaime,Tywin,Is that wise?
4014,Jaime,Tywin,"Its said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own.Yes, but our food and supplies are running low, and this is not land we can live off easily.Weve been waiting for Lord Manderly, but now that his sons have joined us, we need to march."
4015,Robb,Roose,"Marching is all very well,but where, and to what purpose?"
4016,Robb,Roose,"The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him,but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel wed be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer."
4017,Robb,Roose,Though by the time we reach Riverrun ... Im not certain .
4018,Robb,Roose,".Be certain,"
4019,Rickard,Robb,Command.
4020,Rickard,Robb,"As you say, Mother.Ill ask you again.What do you mean to do?"
4021,Robb,Tywin,"Both plans have virtues, but ."
4022,Eddard,Tywin,"The Greatjon says that wont matter if we catch him with his breeches down, but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister wont be so easily surprised.Good,"
4023,Eddard,Robb,"Tell me more.Id leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin, archers mostly, and march the rest down the causeway,but once were below the Neck, Id split our host in two."
4024,Catelyn,Robb,"When Lord Tywin gets word that weve come south, hell march north to engage our main host, leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun."
4025,Catelyn,Robb,"Youd put a river between the two parts of your army.And between Jaime and Lord Tywin,"
4026,Catelyn,Robb,"Theres no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford, where Robert won his crown."
4027,Catelyn,Robb,"Hes your fathers bannerman, isnt that so?"
4028,Catelyn,Robb,"He is,but my father has never trusted him. Robb promised."
4029,Eddard,Robb,"Which force would you command?The horse,"
4030,Eddard,Robb,And the other?The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin.I thought Id give him the honor.
4031,Catelyn,Robb,Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known.
4032,Catelyn,Robb,"Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and he laughed about it.So you agree, then?Your father is not fearless,He is brave, but that is very different."
4033,Catelyn,Robb,"The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell,Well, them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat.No. Robb said at once."
4034,Catelyn,Robb,"Ill give the commands, and assemble an escort to take you home to Winterfell."
4035,Catelyn,Eddard,"I am not going to Winterfell,My father may be dying behind the walls of Riverrun."
4036,Chella,Eddard,I must go to them.
4037,Bronn,Tyrion,"By their fires I call them twenty thousand strong,Their banners are red, with a golden lion.Your father?"
4038,Bronn,Tyrion,"Or my brother Jaime,We shall know soon enough."
4039,Moon,Shagga,"It might be best if I rode down alone,Best for Tyrion son of Tywin,"
4040,Moon,Shagga,"Shagga son of Dolf likes this not. ,,-and feed it to the goats, yes,Shagga, I give you my word as a Lannister, I will return.Why should we trust your word?"
4041,Chella,Tyrion,"Lowland lords have lied to the clans before.You wound me, Chella,Here I thought we had become such friends."
4042,Chella,Tyrion,"You shall ride with me, and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows, Ulf for the Moon Brothers, and Timett son of Timett for the Burned Men."
4043,Chella,Tyrion,The rest shall wait here until I send for you.Try not to kill and maim each other while Im gone.
4044,Bronn,Tyrion,"I wonder what their king burned off,"
4045,Eddison,Tyrion,Who commands here?
4046,Tyrion,Tywin,Ser Flement.
4047,Tyrion,Tywin,"Tyrion,My lord, we all feared you dead, or ."
4048,Tyrion,Tywin,.
4049,Tyrion,Tywin,These .
4050,Tyrion,Tywin,".Bosom friends and loyal retainers,Where will I find my lord father?He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters."
4051,Tyrion,Tywin,"I will see him at once.As you say, my lord."
4052,Shagga,Tyrion,"A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked,"
4053,Shagga,Tyrion,"The lad wont steal your mare,He only wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat."
4054,Shagga,Tyrion,"You have my word, the horse will not be harmed."
4055,Shagga,Tyrion,"This is the horse of Shagga son of Dolf,If he doesnt give her back, chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats,Provided you can find some."
4056,Tyrion,Tywin,"My father?In the common room, mlord.My men will want meat and mead,See that they get it."
4057,Kevan,Tyrion,"Tyrion,Uncle,And my lord father.What a pleasure to find you here."
4058,Tyrion,Tywin,"I see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded.Sorry to disappoint you, Father,No need to leap up and embrace me, I wouldnt want you to strain yourself."
4059,Tyrion,Tywin,"Kind of you to go to war for me,By my lights, it was you who started this,Your brother Jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman.Thats one way we differ, Jaime and .Hes taller as well, you may have noticed."
4060,Tyrion,Tywin,The honor of our House was at stake.
4061,Tyrion,Tywin,"Hear Me Roar, "
4062,Tyrion,Tywin,"Truth be told, none of my blood was actually shed, although it was a close thing once or twice.Morrec and Jyck were killed.I suppose you will be wanting some new men.Dont trouble yourself, Father, Ive acquired a few of my own."
4063,Edmure,Tyrion,How is your war going?
4064,Edmure,Jaime,"Well enough, for the nonce.Ser Edmure had scattered small troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding, and your lord father and I were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup.Your brother has been covering himself with glory,He smashed the Lords Vance and Piper at the Golden Tooth, and met the massed power of the Tullys under the walls of Riverrun."
4065,Jaime,Kevan,"The rest fled to their own strongholds.Your father and I have been marching on each in turn,With Lord Blackwood gone, Raventree fell at once, and Lady Whent yielded Harrenhal for want of men to defend it."
4066,Kevan,Tyrion,.Leaving you unopposed?
4067,Kevan,Tyrion,"Not wholly,The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling his levies at the Twins.No matter,Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air, and all he smells now is ruin."
4068,Eddard,Tyrion,"Unless the Starks and the Arryns come forth to oppose us, this war is good as won.I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you,The Starks are another matter.  his father said. Ser Kevan agreed,  Lord Tywin declared."
4069,Tyrion,Tywin,I doubt he has the stomach for it.
4070,Cersei,Tyrion,And what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this butchers work is being done?
4071,Cersei,Tyrion,"How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment of his dear friend Eddard?Robert Baratheon is dead,Your nephew reigns in Kings Landing."
4072,Cersei,Tyrion,"My sister, you mean."
4073,Cersei,Tyrion,"If you have a mind to make yourself of use, I will give you a command,Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear, raiding our lands across the Red Fork."
4074,Tyrion,Tywin,"The gall of them, fighting back.Ordinarily Id be glad to punish such rudeness, Father, but the truth is, I have pressing business elsewhere.Do you?"
4075,Beric,Tywin,We also have a pair of Eddard Starks afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties.
4076,Beric,Tyrion,Without making too much a botch of it?
4077,Beric,Tyrion,"Father, it warms my heart to think that you might entrust me with ."
4078,Kevan,Tyrion,"If I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric, I shall spank them both."
4079,Kevan,Tyrion,"First, though, I have some promises of my own to keep,I shall require three thousand helms and as many hauberks, plus swords, pikes, steel spearheads, maces, battleaxes, gauntlets, gorgets, greaves, breastplates, wagons to carry all this-"
4080,Shagga,Tyrion,"Little redcape,when next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire.What, no goats?"
4081,Tyrion,Tywin,Who might you be?
4082,Tyrion,Tywin,"They followed me home, Father,May I keep them?They dont eat much."
4083,Conn,Kevan,By what right do you savages intrude on our councils?
4084,Conn,Kevan,"Savages, lowlander?"
4085,Chella,Timett,"We are free men, and free men by rights sit on all war councils.Which one is the lion lord?"
4086,Chella,Timett,"They are both old men,"
4087,Tyrion,Tywin,"Tyrion, have you forgotten your courtesies?"
4088,Tyrion,Tywin,honored guests.
4089,Chella,Tyrion,"With pleasure,The fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears.Im no maid,My sons have taken fifty ears among them.May they take fifty more."
4090,Shagga,Tyrion,This is Conn son of Coratt.
4091,Bronn,Tywin,"He has already changed sides twice in the short time Ive known him, you and he ought to get on famously, Father.May I present my lord father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, and once and future Hand of the King."
4092,Shagga,Tywin,"Even in the west, we know the prowess of the warrior clans of the Mountains of the Moon.What brings you down from your strongholds, my lords?Horses,A promise of silk and steel,"
4093,Tyrion,Tywin,"My lord,Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway."
4094,Addam,Tyrion,"So the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the lions,Splendid."
4095,Addam,Kevan,"He is not to engage the northerners until we arrive, but I want him to harass their flanks and draw them farther south.It will be as you command."
4096,Kevan,Tywin,"We are well situated here,Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes.If they are coming south, I say let them come, and break themselves against us.The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers,The sooner the Starks are broken, the sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon.Tell the drummers to beat assembly, and send word to Jaime that I am marching against Robb Stark.As you will,"
4097,Chella,Conn,"It is said that the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear.It is said truly,And the women,Ride with me against my enemies, and you shall have all my son promised you, and more,Would you pay us with our own coin?"
4098,Chella,Tywin,"Why should we need the fathers promise, when we have the sons?I said nothing of need,My words were courtesy, nothing more."
4099,Tyrion,Tywin,"The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice, and even my boldest knights fear to face them."
4100,Conn,Tyrion,"The Burned Men fear nothing.Timett son of Timett will ride with the lions.Wherever the Burned Men go, the Stone Crows have been there first,We ride as well.Shagga son of Dolf will chop off their manhoods and feed them to the crows.We will ride with you, lion lord,"
4101,Tyrion,Tywin,"Until we hold the steel he has pledged us, his life is ours."
4102,Tyrion,Tywin,"Joy,"
4103,Mandon,Sansa,"Honor guards for my daughter-to-be,Freedom, of the castle"
4104,Barristan,Joffrey,"All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.All hail his lady mother, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent, Light of the West, and Protector of the Realm."
4105,Pycelle,Sansa,"It is a kings duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true.Grand Maester Pycelle, I command you to read my decrees."
4106,Pycelle,Sansa,"In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, take up the office of Hand of the King, to speak with his voice, lead his armies against his enemies, and carry out his royal will."
4107,Pycelle,Sansa,"In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who has ever been his staunchest support, be seated upon his small council, that she may help him rule wisely and with justice."
4108,Pycelle,Sansa,The small council consents.
4109,Pycelle,Sansa,"It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of Kings Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time."
4110,Janos,Sansa,The small council consents.
4111,Cersei,Pycelle,"Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, with our beloved Robert so lately dead, it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount importance He looked to the queen."
4112,Barristan,Cersei,"Ser Barristan Selmy, stand forth."
4113,Barristan,Cersei,"Your Grace, I am yours to command.Rise, Ser Barristan,You may remove your helm.My lady?"
4114,Cersei,Janos,"You have served the realm long and faithfully, good ser, and every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks."
4115,Cersei,Janos,It is the wish of king and council that you lay down your heavy burden.My .
4116,Janos,Joffrey,Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
4117,Janos,Joffrey,"Your Grace,The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood."
4118,Joffrey,Sansa,"Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of his sacred trust.Whose death, Ser Barristan?"
4119,Joffrey,Sansa,"Yours, or your kings?You let my father die,Youre too old to protect anybody."
4120,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your Grace,I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year."
4121,Cersei,Petyr,".And all of them dead,Your time is done,Joffrey requires men around him who are young and strong.The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as the Lord Commander of Sworn Brothers of the White Swords.The Kingslayer,The false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend.Have a care for your words, ser,You are speaking of our beloved brother, your kings own blood."
4122,Barristan,Varys,"We are not unmindful of your service, good ser.Lord Tywin Lannister has generously agreed to grant you a handsome tract of land north of Lannisport, beside the sea, with gold and men sufficient to build you a stout keep, and servants to see to your every need."
4123,Barristan,Varys,"A hall to die in, and men to bury me."
4124,Barristan,Varys,but I spit upon your pity.
4125,Joffrey,Petyr,"I am a knight,"
4126,Joffrey,Petyr,"I shall die a knight.A naked knight, it would seem,"
4127,Barristan,Meryn,"Have no fear, sers, your king is safe ."
4128,Barristan,Meryn,"If you would serve under the Kingslayer, not a one of you is fit to wear the white."
4129,Barristan,Meryn,"Here, boy."
4130,Joffrey,Sansa,Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne.
4131,Joffrey,Varys,"He called me boy,He talked about my uncle Stannis too.Idle talk,Without meaning I want him seized and questioned."
4132,Janos,Joffrey,"I said, I want him seized!"
4133,Janos,Joffrey,"My gold cloaks will see to it, Your Grace.Good,"
4134,Joffrey,Petyr,"Your Grace,If we might resume, the seven are now six.We find ourselves in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard."
4135,Joffrey,Sandor,"Tell them, Mother.The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect His Grace than his sworn shield, Sandor Clegane.How do you like that, dog?"
4136,Boros,Sandor,"Why not?I have no lands nor wife to forsake, and whod care if I did?"
4137,Boros,Sandor,"But I warn you, Ill say no knights vows.The Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard have always been knights,Until now,"
4138,Arya,Sansa,"If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence."
4139,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your Grace,"
4140,Joffrey,Sansa,"Come forward, my lady,"
4141,Barristan,Sansa,"The Lady Sansa, of House Stark,"
4142,Barristan,Pycelle,"Do you have some business for king and council, Sansa?"
4143,Barristan,Pycelle,I do.
4144,Pycelle,Varys,"As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was the Hand of the King."
4145,Pycelle,Varys,"Sansa, you disappoint me.What did I tell you about traitors blood?Your father has committed grave and terrible crimes, my lady,Ah, poor sad thing,She is only a babe, my lords, she does not know what she asks."
4146,Joffrey,Sansa,"Let her speak,I want to hear what she says.Thank you, Your Grace."
4147,Pycelle,Sansa,"Treason is a noxious weed,It must be torn up, root and stem and seed, lest new traitors sprout from every roadside.Do you deny your fathers crime?"
4148,Pycelle,Sansa,"No, my lords."
4149,Robert,Sansa,I know he must be punished.
4150,Joffrey,Stannis,.
4151,Sansa,Varys,"He said I wasnt the king.Why did he say that?His leg was broken,It hurt ever so much, Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy, and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds.Otherwise he would never have said it."
4152,Joffrey,Pycelle,"and yet, they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.Treason is treason,"
4153,Cersei,Joffrey,Mother?
4154,Joffrey,Sansa,"If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime,we would know he had repented his folly."
4155,Joffrey,Sansa,Do you have any more to say?
4156,Joffrey,Sansa,Only .
4157,Daenerys,Drogo,
4158,Joffrey,Sansa,"Your sweet words have moved me,I shall do as you ask ."
4159,Joffrey,Sansa,"He has to confess and say that Im the king, or there will be no mercy for him.He will,Oh, I know he will."
4160,Eddard,Robert,"Ah, Robert,"
4161,Cersei,Robert,"Fool, thrice-damned blind fool."
4162,Cersei,Eddard,"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,"
4163,Eddard,Robert,"Look at us, Eddard,Gods, how did we come to this?"
4164,Eddard,Robert,.
4165,Eddard,Robert,"You stiff-necked fool,"
4166,Petyr,Robert,Will honor shield your children?
4167,Eddard,Eddison,How long .
4168,Eddard,Eddison,"No talking,Please,"
4169,Eddard,Harren,.
4170,Eddard,Grunt,"Gods save me,I am going mad."
4171,Catelyn,Cersei,"No,"
4172,Catelyn,Eddard,"Food,Wine,"
4173,Eddard,Varys,"Drink, Lord Eddard."
4174,Eddard,Varys,Varys?
4175,Eddard,Varys,Im not .
4176,Eddard,Varys,Youre here.
4177,Eddard,Varys,How did you .
4178,Eddard,Varys,"what sort of magician are you?A thirsty one,Drink, my lord."
4179,Eddard,Varys,"Is this the same poison they gave Robert?You wrong me,Truly, no one loves a eunuch.Give me the skin."
4180,Eddard,Varys,"Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney, but no more poisonous than most,Here."
4181,Eddard,Varys,Dregs.
4182,Eddard,Varys,All men must swallow the sour with the sweet.
4183,Eddard,Varys,"Your hour has come, my lord.My daughters ."
4184,Eddard,Varys,".The younger girl escaped Ser Meryn and fled,I have not been able to find her."
4185,Cersei,Eddard,"A pity you couldnt have been there, you would have been touched."
4186,Cersei,Eddard,"I trust you realize that you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?The queen will not kill me,"
4187,Eddard,Varys,Cat .
4188,Eddard,Varys,".The wrong brother,And lost to her, in any case."
4189,Eddard,Varys,"I expect he is dead by now, somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon.If that is true, slit my throat and have done with it."
4190,Eddard,Varys,Your blood is the last thing I desire.
4191,Eddard,Varys,"When they slaughtered my guard, you stood beside the queen and watched, and said not a word.And would again.I seem to recall that I was unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister swords."
4192,Eddard,Varys,"When I was a young boy, before I was cut, I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities."
4193,Eddard,Varys,A courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight.
4194,Eddard,Varys,Can you free me from this pit?I could .
4195,Eddard,Varys,"Questions would be asked, and the answers would lead back to me."
4196,Eddard,Varys,"You are blunt.A eunuch has no honor, and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples, my lord.Would you at least consent to carry a message out for me?That would depend on the message."
4197,Eddard,Varys,"And when you have written what you will, I will take the letter and read it, and deliver it or not, as best serves my own ends.Your own ends.What ends are those, Lord Varys?Peace,If there was one soul in Kings Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me."
4198,Eddard,Varys,"For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies, but I could not protect him from his friends.What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffreys birth?The madness of mercy,Ah,To be sure."
4199,Eddard,Varys,I have met so few of them in my life.
4200,Eddard,Varys,"When I see what honesty and honor have won you, I understand why."
4201,Eddard,Robert,The kings wine .
4202,Eddard,Robert,"did you question Lancel?Oh, indeed.Cersei gave him the wineskins, and told him it was Roberts favorite vintage."
4203,Eddard,Robert,A hunter lives a perilous life.
4204,Eddard,Robert,It was your mercy.
4205,Eddard,Robert,"Gods forgive me.If there are gods,"
4206,Renly,Stannis,The iron gauntlet and the silk glove.
4207,Renly,Varys,"You have been foolish, my lord.You ought to have heeded Petyr when he urged you to support Joffreys succession.How ."
4208,Eddard,Varys,how could you know of that?
4209,Eddard,Varys,"I know, thats all that need concern you.I also know that on the morrow the queen will pay you a visit."
4210,Eddard,Varys,"Why?Cersei is frightened of you, my lord ."
4211,Eddard,Elia,"And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.Robb is only a boy,A boy with an army,Yet only a boy, as you say."
4212,Eddard,Varys,"and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe she cares more about the boy.Stannis Baratheon is Roberts true heir,The throne is his by rights.I would welcome his ascent."
4213,Stannis,Varys,"Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you."
4214,Cersei,Eddard,"She knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one.You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, butchered my men, and crippled my son?"
4215,Eddard,Varys,"I want you to serve the realm,Tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason, command your son to lay down his sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir."
4216,Eddard,Jon,"If you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son of yours."
4217,Petyr,Varys,"Is this your own scheme,or are you in league with Petyr?"
4218,Petyr,Varys,I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor.
4219,Petyr,Varys,"just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers.And just as you let me believe that you were mine.Tell me, Lord Varys, who do you truly serve?"
4220,Petyr,Varys,"Why, the realm, my good lord, how ever could you doubt that?"
4221,Eddard,Varys,"I serve the realm, and the realm needs peace."
4222,Eddard,Varys,"So what is your answer, Lord Eddard?Give me your word that youll tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling.If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor.My life is not so precious to me as that.Pity."
4223,Eddard,Varys,"And your daughters life, my lord?How precious is that?"
4224,Eddard,Varys,"My daughter The queen most certainly has not.No, Varys, gods have mercy, do as you like with me, but leave my daughter out of your schemes.Sansas no more than a child.Rhaenys was a child too."
4225,Eddard,Varys,"Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her door."
4226,Eddard,Varys,"The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer."
4227,Catelyn,Sansa,"The choice, my dear lord Hand, is entirely yours."
4228,Catelyn,Edmure,"Late again,"
4229,Catelyn,Robb,"Four thousand men,Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself.Surely he means to join his power to ours.Does he?"
4230,Robb,Walder,"I wonder.Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be surprised.Hes your fathers bannerman.Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb."
4231,Catelyn,Robb,".Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?"
4232,Catelyn,Robb,"If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey intends to do.He has an old mans caution and a young mans ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.We must have the Twins, Mother,There is no other way across the river.You know that.Yes.And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that."
4233,Theon,Tywin,Ser Brynden says to tell you hes crossed swords with the Lannisters.
4234,Catelyn,Tywin,Or ever.
4235,Catelyn,Tywin,"Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and hes pulling back south, burning as he goes.He knows where we are, more or less, but the Brynden vows he will not know when we split.Unless Lord Frey tells him,Theon, when you return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements.I want no birds bringing word of my sons movements to Lord Tywin.Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady,A few more blackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie.Ill save you their feathers for a hat."
4236,Brynden,Theon,"What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters; burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts?Theres been some fighting between Ser Addams men and Lord Walders,Not a days ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up.Most of Lord Walders strength remains massed at the Twins, though."
4237,Catelyn,Robb,"If hes been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows,"
4238,Catelyn,Robb,"Defending his own lands is one thing, open battle against Lord Tywin quite another."
4239,Robb,Theon,Has the Brynden found any other way across the Green Fork?
4240,Robb,Theon,"The rivers running high and fast.Ser Brynden says it cant be forded, not this far north.I must have that crossing!"
4241,Robb,Theon,"Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs."
4242,Theon,Tywin,"Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,We have five times his numbers.You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.Not easily,and not in time."
4243,Brynden,Robb,What would my lord father do?
4244,Brynden,Robb,"Find a way across,Whatever it took."
4245,Brynden,Catelyn,"There has been a battle under the walls of Riverrun,We had it from a Lannister outrider we took captive.The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmures host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight."
4246,Brynden,Catelyn,"And my brother?Wounded and taken prisoner,Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are under siege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaimes host."
4247,Brynden,Robb,"We must get across this accursed river if were to have any hope of relieving them   in time.That will not be easily done,Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles, and his gates are closed and barred.Damn the man,If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, hell leave me no choice but to storm his walls.Ill pull the Twins down around his ears if I have to, well see how well he likes that!You sound like a sulky boy, Robb,A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down.A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot."
4248,Catelyn,Robb,"Tell me what you mean, Mother,The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll.What toll?What does he want?"
4249,Catelyn,Robb,"That is what we must discover.And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in battle ."
4250,Catelyn,Robb,I see no other choices.
4251,Rickard,Roose,"That cannot be assaulted, my lords,Nor can we take it by siege, without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle,"
4252,Helman,Roose,"Even if we had the time.Which, to be sure, we do not."
4253,Robb,Stevron,"My lord father has sent me to greet you, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host.I do."
4254,Galbart,Robb,My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here.
4255,Galbart,Robb,"You must not do this, my lord,Lord Walder is not to be trusted."
4256,Robb,Roose,"Go in there alone and youre his.He can sell you to the Lannisters, throw you in a dungeon, or slit your throat, as he likes.If he wants to talk to us, let him open his gates, and we will all share his meat and mead,Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of his men and ours,"
4257,Greatjon,Robb,"I will go, You, my lady?"
4258,Greatjon,Robb,"Mother, are you certain?"
4259,Catelyn,Robb,"Never more,Lord Walder is my fathers bannerman."
4260,Catelyn,Robb,He would never offer me any harm.
4261,Robb,Stevron,"I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Catelyn,To vouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you.,, "
4262,Robb,Stevron,"I require my lady mothers return by evenfall, Ser Stevron,It is not my intent to linger here long."
4263,Catelyn,Stevron,"As you say, my lord."
4264,Catelyn,Spare,"It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord,"
4265,Catelyn,Spare,Is it?
4266,Catelyn,Walder,What am I to do with you?
4267,Catelyn,Walder,"Father,you forget yourself."
4268,Catelyn,Walder,"Ill hear no instructions from you.This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest, Father,Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy,Ill speak any way I like, damn you."
4269,Catelyn,Walder,Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed.
4270,Catelyn,Walder,"Danwell, Whalen, help me to my chair."
4271,Catelyn,Walder,"There,Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.Why are you here?To ask you to open your gates, my lord,My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way.To Riverrun?"
4272,Catelyn,Walder,"Oh, no need to tell me, no need."
4273,Catelyn,Walder,"The old man can still read a map.To Riverrun,"
4274,Catelyn,Walder,"Where I might have expected to find you, my lord.You are still my fathers bannerman, are you not?Heh, I called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the walls."
4275,Jared,Walder,"I am well past marching myself, Lady Catelyn."
4276,Jared,Walder,"Tell her, Jared.Tell her that was my intent.It was, my lady,On my honor.Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march?"
4277,Catelyn,Jared,I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese.
4278,Catelyn,Jared,All those who did go south are running north again.
4279,Daenerys,Drogo,"All the more reason that we must reach Riverrun, and soon."
4280,Catelyn,Stevron,What are you all looking at?
4281,Catelyn,Stevron,Get out of here.
4282,Catelyn,Stevron,"Out, out, out."
4283,Catelyn,Stevron,"I wont do it.I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred.That would boil them, to be sure."
4284,Catelyn,Stevron,"Now, what do you want to say?We want to cross,Oh, do you?"
4285,Catelyn,Jaime,Why should I let you?
4286,Catelyn,Jaime,"If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements, Lord Frey, you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls.Theyll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here,Dont you try and frighten me, my lady."
4287,Catelyn,Joffrey,"Ill match you son for son, and Ill still have eighteen when yours are all dead.You swore an oath to my father,"
4288,Catelyn,Joffrey,"Oh, yes, I said some words, but I swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me."
4289,Joffrey,Walder,"If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, Id help the Lannisters boil you all.Why dont you?"
4290,Joffrey,Walder,"Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, Warden of the West, Hand of the King, oh, what a great man that one is, him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there."
4291,Catelyn,Walder,"Ill match him son for son, and Ill still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead!"
4292,Catelyn,Walder,"If Lord Tywin wants my help, he can bloody well ask for it."
4293,Catelyn,Walder,"I am asking for your help, my lord,And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice."
4294,Catelyn,Walder,"Save your sweet words, my lady."
4295,Catelyn,Walder,"Perhaps Ill make him heir, wouldnt that boil the rest of them?Im certain she will give you many sons."
4296,Catelyn,Walder,Your lord father did not come to the wedding.
4297,Hoster,Jon,"And your sister, that one, shes full as bad."
4298,Danwell,Walder,I was speaking of your sister.
4299,Stannis,Walder,which one was his father now?
4300,Stannis,Walder,"Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldnt have him, or the other one, and I blame your lady sister for that."
4301,Catelyn,Stannis,I ask you.
4302,Catelyn,Stannis,"I had understood that Lysas boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock.No, it was Lord Stannis,Do you think I cant tell Lord Stannis from Lord Tywin?"
4303,Catelyn,Walder,"Boy or girl, it will be red, wrinkled, and squalling, and like as not shell want to name it Walder or Walda."
4304,Catelyn,Walder,"Jon Arryn was going to foster his son with Lord Stannis, you are quite certain of that?Yes, yes, yes,Only he died, so what does it matter?You say you want to cross the river?We do., "
4305,Catelyn,Walder,"Not unless I allow it, and why should I?The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine."
4306,Robb,Walder,"Its done,Lord Walder will grant you your crossing."
4307,Robb,Walder,"Lord Walder may need help keeping faith.As you say, Mother,Perhaps ."
4308,Robb,Walder,"Ser Helman Tallhart, do you think?A fine choice.What ."
4309,Robb,Walder,"what did he want of us?If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Freys grandsons north to Winterfell,I have agreed to take them as wards."
4310,Robb,Walder,"Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age, I should think.Is that all?"
4311,Robb,Walder,  she went on.
4312,Robb,Walder,"Fine, thats fine, if hes-Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walders youngest son, Elmar, when the two of them come of age."
4313,Robb,Walder,"Arya wont like that one bit.And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done,His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer.He has a number he thinks might be suitable."
4314,Robb,Walder,"I see.Do you consent?Can I refuse?Not if you wish to cross.I consent,"
4315,Jon,Tywin,"Are you well, Snow?"
4316,Jon,Tywin,"Well, Well. I am, my lord,"
4317,Jon,Tywin,And you?
4318,Jon,Tywin,A dead man tried to kill me.How well could I be?
4319,Aemon,Jon,You do not look well.How is your hand?Healing.
4320,Aemon,Jon,"The maester says Ill have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before.A scarred hand is nothing.On the Wall, youll be wearing gloves often as not.As you say, my lord."
4321,Aemon,Jon,"Dywen and Hake returned last night,They found no sign of your uncle, no more than the others did.I know."
4322,Aemon,Jon,"You know,How is it that everyone knows everything around here?"
4323,Aemon,Jon,It would seem there were only the two of .
4324,Aemon,Jon,"Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen."
4325,Aemon,Jon,"My lord,its said there was a bird last night What of it?I had hoped for some word of my father.Father, Father. "
4326,Barristan,Eddard,"Grief and noise,Thats all theyre good for, ravens."
4327,Barristan,Jon,"The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped."
4328,Barristan,Jon,"We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,"
4329,Barristan,Jon,"Boy, boy, boy, boy."
4330,Aemon,Pycelle,What of my sisters?The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.
4331,Aemon,Pycelle,Perhaps they never got my letter.
4332,Jon,Robb,"They tell us what they want us to know, and thats little enough."
4333,Jon,Robb,"Corn, Corn, corn.Oh, be quiet,Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon say youll have use of that hand back? Jon replied."
4334,Jon,Robb,"Here.Youll be ready for this, then."
4335,Eddison,Jon,My lord?The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip.
4336,Eddison,Jon,youd need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade.
4337,Eddison,Jon,"I had the rest made anew.Take it.Take it, Take it, take it."
4338,Eddison,Jon,bastard sword.
4339,Eddison,Jon,"This is Valyrian steel, my lord,"
4340,Jon,Jorah,"It is,It was my fathers sword, and his fathers before him."
4341,Jon,Jorah,I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.
4342,Jon,Jorah,Your son-
4343,Bran,Jon,One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.
4344,Eddard,Jon,"My lord, you honor me, but-Spare me your buts, boy,I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours."
4345,Eddison,Jon,"yet if the Nights Watch does not remember, who will?Who will, "
4346,Eddard,Jon,"A swords small payment for a life,Take it, Ill hear no more of it, is that understood?Yes, my lord."
4347,Eddard,Jon,"I want no courtesies either,so thank me no thanks."
4348,Eddard,Jon,"Does it have a name, my lord?It did, once.Longclaw, it was called.Claw, Claw. Longclaw is an apt name."
4349,Eddard,Jon,"Wolves have claws, as much as bears."
4350,Eddard,Jon,I suppose they do.
4351,Joffrey,Jon,"Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.Ser Endrew?"
4352,Joffrey,Jon,"Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man."
4353,Joffrey,Jon,Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
4354,Joffrey,Jon,Why?
4355,Joffrey,Jon,"Because I sent him, why do you think?"
4356,Joffrey,Jon,"and Ser Allisers a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.Crow. "
4357,Joffrey,Jon,"As well,it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke."
4358,Joffrey,Jon,And dont think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall.
4359,Alliser,Jon,"Ill expect you to act the part, henceforth.Yes, my lord."
4360,Alliser,Hobb,"I had forgotten how much a new beard itches,Well, no help for that.Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?Yes, my lord.Good."
4361,Hobb,Jon,Even the bird wouldnt touch it.
4362,Hobb,Jon,Away with you.Ive work to do.
4363,Hobb,Jon,"Sweet steel,You earned that, Snow,"
4364,Grenn,Jon,"Well, come about, lets have a look.At what?"
4365,Grenn,Jon,"Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?The sword,We want to see the sword."
4366,Grenn,Jon,You knew.
4367,Grenn,Halder,"Were not all as dumb as Grenn.You are so,Youre dumber."
4368,Grenn,Halder,"I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel,and your friend Samwellbought the garnets in Moles Town.We knew even before that, though,Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge.He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade.The sword!"
4369,Grenn,Jon,"The sword, the sword, the sword."
4370,Grenn,Jon,"Valyrian steel,I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,He cut his head off trying to shave."
4371,Grenn,Jon,"The Nights Watch is thousands of years old,but Ill wager Lord Snows the first brother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commanders Tower."
4372,Jaremy,Jon,"I need to see Hobb about the Old Bears supper,"
4373,Jon,Samwell,Look.Its you.
4374,Jon,Samwell,"Youre the one deserves an honor,"
4375,Jon,Samwell,Jon?
4376,Jon,Samwell,SamwellWhat is it?Do you want to see the sword?
4377,Randyll,Samwell,"I was heir to my fathers blade once,Heartsbane."
4378,Jon,Randyll,Dickon will have it now.
4379,Jon,Samwell,I ah .
4380,Jon,Samwell,Maester Aemon wants to see you.
4381,Jon,Samwell,Why?
4382,Jon,Samwell,"You told him, didnt you?"
4383,Jon,Samwell,You told him that you told me.I .
4384,Jon,Samwell,".Hes blind,I can find the way myself."
4385,Clydas,Jon,Samwellsaid you wanted me?
4386,Clydas,Jon,I did indeed.
4387,Clydas,Jon,Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me.
4388,Aemon,Jon,"Toss the meat into the cages,The birds will do the rest. "
4389,Aemon,Jon,"Lord Mormonts raven likes fruit and corn.He is a rare bird,Most ravens will eat grain, but they prefer flesh."
4390,Aemon,Jon,"and like men, not all ravens are alike."
4391,Aemon,Jon,"Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,"
4392,Aemon,Jon,"Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the   ravens with doves, did you know?"
4393,Aemon,Jon,The Nights Watch prefers ravens.
4394,Aemon,Jon,"Dywen says the wildlings call us crows,The crow is the ravens poor cousin.They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood."
4395,Aemon,Jon,"Jon, did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take no wives and father no children?"
4396,Aemon,Jon,No.
4397,Aemon,Jon,"So they will not love,for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty."
4398,Eddard,Jon,"Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
4399,Eddard,Jon,"He would do whatever was right,"
4400,Eddard,Jon,No matter what.Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand.
4401,Aegon,Harren,The men who formed the Nights Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north.
4402,Aegon,Harren,"Yet brothers they had, and sisters."
4403,Aegon,Harren,They kept their pledge.
4404,Aemon,Jon,"A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear."
4405,Aemon,Jon,"Yet soon or late in every mans life comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose."
4406,Aemon,Jon,And this is my day .
4407,Aemon,Jon,is that what youre saying?
4408,Aemon,Jon,"It hurts, boy,Oh, yes."
4409,Aemon,Jon,"I know.You dont know,No one knows."
4410,Aemon,Jon,.
4411,Aemon,Jon,"Have you heard nothing Ive told you, Jon?Do you think you are the first?"
4412,Aemon,Jon,Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows.
4413,Aemon,Jon,.
4414,Aemon,Jon,Who are you?
4415,Aemon,Jon,"Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Nights Watch.In my order, we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar."
4416,Aemon,Jon,"My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead."
4417,Aemon,Jon,.Aemon .
4418,Aemon,Jon,Targaryen?
4419,Aemon,Jon,"Once,Once."
4420,Aemon,Jon,As I have.
4421,Daenerys,Jon,As I have .
4422,Daenerys,Jon,.
4423,Jorah,Viserys,"Your lord husband awaits you within the town.Drogo took no harm?A few cuts,"
4424,Jorah,Viserys,"His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair, and now Khal Drogos every step rings louder than before."
4425,Daenerys,Jorah,"Most of Ogos riders fled,Still, there may be as many as ten thousand captives."
4426,Illyrio,Jorah,"Ive told the khal he ought to make for Meereen,Theyll pay a better price than hed get from a slaving caravan."
4427,Daenerys,Illyrio,"If enough children survive the journey, the gold will buy us all the ships we need, and hire men to sail them."
4428,Daenerys,Jorah,"Make them stop,Khaleesi?"
4429,Daenerys,Jorah,"You heard my words,Stop them."
4430,Daenerys,Jorah,"Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah.I want no rape."
4431,Daenerys,Jorah,"Princess,"
4432,Daenerys,Jorah,Now they claim their reward.
4433,Daenerys,Quaro,"She is a lamb girl,She is nothing, Khaleesi."
4434,Irri,Quaro,"The Lamb Men lay with sheep, it is known.It is known,It is known,If her wailing offends your ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue."
4435,Daenerys,Drogo,"I will not have her harmed,I claim her.Do as I command you, or Khal Drogo will know the reason why."
4436,Jorah,Quaro,"Go with them,As you command."
4437,Daenerys,Jorah,"You are your brothers sister, in truth.Viserys?"
4438,Daenerys,Jhogo,"No,Rhaegar."
4439,Aggo,Daenerys,What do you want done with her?
4440,Aggo,Daenerys,"Doreah, see to her hurts."
4441,Aggo,Daenerys,"The rest, with me."
4442,Daenerys,Jorah,"You cannot claim them all, child,I am khaleesi, heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the blood of the dragon,It is not for you to tell me what I cannot do."
4443,Daenerys,Jhiqui,My sun-and-stars is wounded.
4444,Drogo,Haggo,"Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo,I kill him for it, and Ogo too."
4445,Drogo,Haggo,"Is Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him.No man can stand before the sun of my life,the father of the stallion who mounts the world."
4446,Daenerys,Drogo,"This one is Mago, who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo."
4447,Daenerys,Drogo,"Tell me the truth of this, moon of my life,"
4448,Daenerys,Drogo,"This is the way of war.These women are our slaves now, to do with as we please.It pleases me to hold them safe,If your warriors would mount these women, let them take them gently and keep them for wives.Give them places in the khalasar and let them bear you sons."
4449,Daenerys,Viserys,Does the horse breed with the sheep?
4450,Daenerys,Drogo,The dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.
4451,Daenerys,Drogo,See how fierce she grows!
4452,Daenerys,Drogo,"It is my son inside her, the stallion who   mounts the world, filling her with his fire."
4453,Daenerys,Mag,These belong to my khaleesi.
4454,Daenerys,Jorah,Where are the healers?
4455,Cohollo,Daenerys,"Why do they not attend the khal?The khal sent the hairless men away, Khaleesi,"
4456,Daenerys,Drogo,"Many riders are hurt,Let them be healed first.This arrow is no more than the bite of a fly, this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son."
4457,Daenerys,Drogo,"It is not for Khal Drogo to wait,Jhogo, seek out these eunuchs and bring them here at once.Silver Lady,I can help the Great Rider with his hurts."
4458,Aggo,Qotho,"The khal needs no help from women who lie with sheep,Aggo, cut out her tongue."
4459,Aggo,Daenerys,No.
4460,Aggo,Qotho,Let her speak.
4461,Aggo,Qotho,"I meant no wrong, fierce riders."
4462,Daenerys,Haggo,I have some small skill in the healing arts.Who are you?
4463,Daenerys,Haggo,"I am named Mirri Maz Duur.I am godswife of this temple.Maegi,"
4464,Mirri,Qotho,"I am a healer,A healer of sheeps,Blood of my blood, I say kill this maegi and wait for the hairless men."
4465,Daenerys,Qotho,"Where did you learn your healing, Mirri Maz Duur?My mother was godswife before me, and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to the Great Shepherd, and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry."
4466,Daenerys,Jorah,"A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin."
4467,Daenerys,Jorah,"A maester?Marwyn, he named himself,From the sea."
4468,Daenerys,Jorah,"He taught me this speech.A maester in Asshai,Tell me, Godswife, what did this Marwyn wear about his neck?A chain so tight it was like to choke him, Iron Lord, with links of many metals."
4469,Daenerys,Mirri,"Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown wears such a chain,and such men do know much of healing.Why should you want to help my khal?All men are one flock, or so we are taught,The Great Shepherd sent me to earth to heal his lambs, wherever I might find them."
4470,Daenerys,Qotho,"We are no sheep, maegi.Stop it,She is mine.I will not have her harmed."
4471,Drogo,Mirri,"The arrow must come out, Qotho.Yes, Great Rider,And your breast must be washed and sewn, lest the wound fester.Do it, then,Great Rider,my tools and potions are inside the gods house, where the healing powers are strongest.I will carry you, blood of my blood,"
4472,Drogo,Haggo,"I need no mans help,"
4473,Daenerys,Drogo,"I am no man,so you may lean on me."
4474,Drogo,Mirri,"There,"
4475,Cohollo,Qotho,"Best if you wait outside,We are blood of his blood,Here we wait."
4476,Mirri,Qotho,"Know this, wife of the Lamb God.Harm the khal and you suffer the same."
4477,Daenerys,Mirri,She will do no harm.
4478,Daenerys,Mirri,"If you must stay, then help,The Great Rider is too strong for me.Hold him still while I draw the arrow from his flesh."
4479,Drogo,Mirri,"You must say the prayers I give you and keep the lambskin in place for ten days and ten nights,There will be fever, and itching, and a great scar when the healing is done."
4480,Drogo,Mirri,"I sing of my scars, sheep woman."
4481,Drogo,Mirri,"Drink neither wine nor the milk of the poppy,Pain you will have, but you must keep your body strong to fight the poison spirits.I am khal,I spit on pain and drink what I like.Cohollo, bring my vest."
4482,Drogo,Mirri,"Before,"
4483,Daenerys,Mirri,".I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a babe,My time is near,I would have you attend me when he comes, if you would."
4484,Daenerys,Drogo,"Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell her.She will do as you command."
4485,Drogo,Haggo,"Come, my blood."
4486,Haggo,Qotho,It is time to ride.
4487,Mirri,Qotho,"Remember, maegi, as the khal fares, so shall you.As you say, rider,The Great Shepherd guards the flock."
4488,Tyrion,Tywin,"My pardons,Perhaps Id best charge you with burying our dead, Tyrion,If you are as late to battle as you are to table, the fighting will all be done by the time you arrive.Oh, surely you can save me a peasant or two, Father,Not too many, I wouldnt want to be greedy."
4489,Tyrion,Tywin,"Ser Addams outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins,Lord Freys levies have joined them.They are likely no more than a days march north of us.Please, Father,Im about to eat.Does the thought of facing the Stark boy unman you, Tyrion?Your brother Jaime would be eager to come to grips with him.Id sooner come to grips with that pig.Robb Stark is not half so tender, and he never smelled as good."
4490,Tyrion,Tywin,"I hope your savages do not share your reluctance, else weve wasted our good steel on them.My savages will put your steel to excellent use, my lord,"
4491,Kevan,Tyrion,"I saw that great hairy one today, the one who insisted that he must have two battle-axes, the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades.Shagga likes to kill with either hand,He still had that wood-axe of his strapped to his back.Shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two."
4492,Kevan,Tywin,We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when we come to battle.had a thought
4493,Tyrion,Tywin,The vanguard?
4494,Kevan,Tyrion,"They seem ferocious enough,Ferocious?"
4495,Moon,Tyrion,Let me tell you how ferocious they are.
4496,Jaime,Tyrion,"Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock, which was fortunate, but even so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay.When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander,"
4497,Tyrion,Tywin,"A bigger man would be able to put the fear in them, is that what youre saying, my lord?"
4498,Tyrion,Tywin,"If my sons men will not obey his commands, perhaps the vanguard is not the place for him.No doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear, guarding our baggage train.Do me no kindnesses, Father,If you have no other command to offer me, Ill lead your van."
4499,Tyrion,Tywin,I said nothing about command.You will serve under Ser Gregor.
4500,Tyrion,Tywin,"I find I am not hungry after all,Pray excuse me, my lords."
4501,Conn,Shagga,Tyrion Halftnan!
4502,Conn,Shagga,"We have an ox.I can see that, Conn son of Coratt."
4503,Conn,Moon,I thank you.Send for me when the ox is cooked.
4504,Podrick,Tyrion,"What did you eat?Trout, mlord,Bronn caught them."
4505,Ilyn,Tyrion,"Definitely a tongue,Someday you must learn to use it."
4506,Bronn,Tyrion,Is this her?
4507,Bronn,Tyrion,"It is, mlord, and she can speak for herself, if it please you."
4508,Bronn,Tyrion,"I am Tyrion, of House Lannister.Men call me the Imp.My mother named me Shae."
4509,Bronn,Tyrion,often.
4510,Bronn,Tyrion,"Into the tent, Shae, if you would be so kind."
4511,Bronn,Tyrion,"I would prefer one who is reasonably young, with as pretty a face as you can find,If she has washed sometime this year, I shall be glad."
4512,Bronn,Tyrion,"Be certain that you tell her who I am, and warn her of what I am."
4513,Bronn,Tyrion,"Shall I take my gown off, mlord?"
4514,Bronn,Tyrion,"In good time.Are you a maiden, Shae?If it please you, mlord,What would please me would be the truth of you, girl.Aye, but that will cost you double."
4515,Bronn,Tyrion,I am a Lannister.
4516,Shae,Tyrion,"and whether I keep you a day or a year, for so long as we are together you will take no other men into your bed.Fair enough."
4517,Shae,Tyrion,"If he dont put down that candle, mord will burn his fingers."
4518,Shae,Tyrion,"Whats that, mlord?"
4519,Shae,Tyrion,"Nothing,A song I learned as a boy, thats all.Go to sleep, sweetling."
4520,Bronn,Tyrion,Where did you find her?
4521,Bronn,Tyrion,I took her from a knight.
4522,Bronn,Tyrion,"that, and my dirk at his throat.Splendid,I seem to recall saying find me a whore, not make me an enemy.The pretty ones were all claimed,Ill be pleased to take her back if youd prefer a toothless drab."
4523,Bronn,Tyrion,"My lord father would call that insolence, and send you to the mines for impertinence.Good for me youre not your father,I saw one with boils all over her nose.Would you like her?What, and break your heart?"
4524,Bronn,Tyrion,I shall keep Shae.
4525,Bronn,Tyrion,Id rather not have him beside me in the battle.
4526,Bronn,Tyrion,"Youll have me beside you in the battle, dwarf."
4527,Bronn,Tyrion,"See that I survive this battle, and you can name your reward."
4528,Bronn,Tyrion,"Whod want to kill the likes of you?My lord father, for one.Hes put me in the van.Id do the same."
4529,Bronn,Tyrion,"Youll give the archers fits.I find you oddly cheering,I must be mad."
4530,Bronn,Tyrion,Beyond a doubt.I woke and mlord was gone.MIord is back now.
4531,Bronn,Shae,"Yes he is,"
4532,Bronn,Tyrion,"You need not fear his like, mlord,He is a small man.And what am , pray?"
4533,Bronn,Tyrion,"A giant?Oh, yes,my giant of Lannister."
4534,Shae,Tyrion,"MIord,Wake up, mlord.Im frightened."
4535,Shae,Tyrion,"My lord fathers trumpets,Battle assembly.I thought Stark was yet a days march away."
4536,Bronn,Tyrion,"My armor,and be quick about it."
4537,Bronn,Tyrion,Do you know whats happened?
4538,Bronn,Tyrion,"The Stark boy stole a march on us,He crept down the kingsroad in the night, and now his host is less than a mile north of here, forming up in battle array."
4539,Bronn,Tyrion,See that the clansmen are ready to ride.
4540,Shae,Tyrion,Where are my clothes?
4541,Shae,Tyrion,There.
4542,Shae,Tyrion,Bring me my boots.
4543,Shae,Tyrion,"If I die, weep for me,How will you know?Youll be dead.Ill know.I believe you would."
4544,Shae,Tyrion,"NIlord looks fearsome.NIlord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor,but I thank you for the kindness."
4545,Bronn,Tyrion,Always follow a big man into battle.
4546,Bronn,Tyrion,"And why is that?They make such splendid targets.That one, hell draw the eyes of every bowman on the field."
4547,Bronn,Tyrion,"I confess, I had not considered it in that light."
4548,Gregor,Tyrion,"Any man runs, Ill cut him down myself,Imp!"
4549,Gregor,Tyrion,If you can.
4550,Gregor,Tyrion,"Look,The river."
4551,Shagga,Tyrion,That river is ours.
4552,Moon,Shagga,"If they dirty our waters, hack off their cocks and feed them to the fishes."
4553,Moon,Shagga,Halfman!
4554,Moon,Tyrion,Halfman!
4555,Moon,Tyrion,Ha fm a n! 
4556,Daenerys,Drogo,
4557,Tyrion,Walder,ere is the boy?
4558,Chella,Tyrion,The river!
4559,Chella,Shagga,"Remember, hew to the river."
4560,Daenerys,Drogo,
4561,Moon,Tyrion,After me!
4562,Bronn,Tyrion,"Dwarf,Die."
4563,Bronn,Tyrion,"Die,"
4564,Bronn,Tyrion,Die!
4565,Bronn,Tyrion,"You die,"
4566,Bronn,Tyrion,Eddard!
4567,Bronn,Tyrion,For Eddard and Winterfell!
4568,Eddison,Tyrion,"Tyrion the Imp,You are mine.Do you yield, Lannister?"
4569,Eddison,Tyrion,Do you yield?
4570,Eddison,Tyrion,"Yield or die,"
4571,Eddison,Tyrion,.
4572,Eddison,Tyrion,"Yes,"
4573,Kevan,Tyrion,"Yield,"
4574,Kevan,Tyrion,"I yield, my lord."
4575,Bronn,Tyrion,"I believe you are losing, ser,"
4576,Bronn,Tyrion,"Small use you turned out to be,It would seem you did well enough on your own,Youve lost the spike off your helm, though."
4577,Bronn,Tyrion,I havent lost it.
4578,Tyrion,Tywin,Do you see my horse?
4579,Conn,Shagga,They have killed Conn son of Coratt.
4580,Kevan,Tyrion,"A fine victory,Your wild   men fought well."
4581,Tyrion,Tywin,"Did that surprise you, Father?"
4582,Tyrion,Tywin,"Did it upset your plans?We were supposed to be butchered, were we not?"
4583,Robb,Tywin,"I put the least disciplined men on the left, yes."
4584,Robb,Tyrion,"Once he was fully committed, Ser Kevans pikes would wheel and take him in the flank, driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve.And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage, yet keep me ignorant of your plans.A feigned rout is less convincing,and I am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages.A pity my savages ruined your dance."
4585,Tyrion,Tywin,"The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years,but a victory is a victory."
4586,Tyrion,Tywin,"Good of you to notice, Father,Might I trouble you to send for your maesters?"
4587,Addam,Tywin,.Lord Tywin!
4588,Tywin,Wyl,"My liege, we have taken some of their commanders."
4589,Addam,Tywin,"Lord Hornwood is dead, and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us.And the boy?"
4590,Addam,Tyrion,"The Stark boy was not with them, my lord.They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of his horse, riding hard for Riverrun."
4591,Hallis,Robb,"it should not be long now, my lady,"
4592,Catelyn,Robb,"It will come when it comes,"
4593,Catelyn,Robb,"Watch for me, little cat,"
4594,Bran,Brandon,Did you watch for me?
4595,Bran,Brandon,"Did you, little cat?"
4596,Bran,Brandon,"I shall not be long, my lady,We will be wed on my return."
4597,Brynden,Robb,"The Kingslayer is restless, and quick to anger,"
4598,Brynden,Robb,"Jaime does not know,Ill stake my life on that."
4599,Galbart,Robb,He does not know.How large is his host?
4600,Galbart,Robb,"Twelve thousand foot, scattered around the castle in three separate camps, with the rivers between,There is no other way to besiege Riverrun, yet still, that will be their undoing.Two or three thousand horse. said Galbart Glover.True enough,yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks.Yes?"
4601,Galbart,Robb,Patience.
4602,Catelyn,Robb,"I must ride down the line, Mother,Father says you should let the men see you before a battle. she said.It will give them courage,"
4603,Catelyn,Maege,"This is not about the honor of your houses,This is about keeping my son alive and whole."
4604,Catelyn,Eon,"Theyre coming, my lady,"
4605,Catelyn,Eon,Gods be with us.
4606,Brynden,Robb,"He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers,He has ridden out with his knights thrice already, to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast."
4607,Eddard,Robb,"Raid him here,A few hundred men, no more."
4608,Eddard,Robb,-his finger moved an inch to the left-
4609,Catelyn,Robb,Winte~pll!
4610,Catelyn,Eddison,LannisterWinterfellTully!
4611,Daenerys,Drogo,To me!
4612,Catelyn,Robb,"Youre hurt,"
4613,Robb,Torrhen,"No,This is ."
4614,Theon,Torrhen,I do not know.
4615,Greatjon,Jaime,"The Kingslayer,"
4616,Greatjon,Jaime,"Lady Stark,"
4617,Catelyn,Theon,"I would offer you my sword, but I seem to have mislaid it.It is not your sword I want, ser,Give me my father and my brother Edmure."
4618,Catelyn,Theon,"Give me my lord husband. I have mislaid them as well, I fear.A pity,Kill him, Robb,Take his head off.No,Hes more use alive than dead.And my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle.A wise man,and honorable.Take him away and put him in irons,Do as my lady mother says,and make certain theres a strong guard around him."
4619,Catelyn,Robb,Why should Lord Karstark want him dead?
4620,Eddard,Galbart,He .
4621,Eddard,Galbart,".Lord Karstarks sons,Both of them,Torrhen and Eddard.And Daryn Hornwood as well.No one can fault Lannister on his courage,When he saw that he was lost, he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley, hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut him down.And almost did.He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstarks neck, after he took Torrhens hand off and split Daryn Hornwoods skull open,All the time he was shouting for me.  Catelyn said."
4622,Garth,Theon,"We have won a battle, not a war.But such a battle!"
4623,Garth,Theon,"My lady, the realm has not seen such a victory since the Field of Fire."
4624,Catelyn,Tywin,.And Lord Tywin?
4625,Catelyn,Robb,"Have you perchance taken Lord Tywin, Theon?No,Until you do, this war is far from done."
4626,Catelyn,Robb,My mother is right.We still have Riverrun.
4627,Daenerys,Drogo,"My lord,Drogo.My sun-and-stars."
4628,Daenerys,Drogo,Drogo. 
4629,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,"
4630,Daenerys,Drogo,"My horse,"
4631,Cohollo,Haggo,"Blood of my blood,"
4632,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,Must ride."
4633,Daenerys,Haggo,"No.He fell from his horse,"
4634,Daenerys,Haggo,"You must not say that,We have ridden far enough today.We will camp here.Here?"
4635,Daenerys,Haggo,"This is no camping ground.It is not for a woman to bid us halt,not even a khaleesi.We camp here,Haggo, tell them Khal Drogo commanded the halt."
4636,Cohollo,Qotho,  Qotho said.
4637,Daenerys,Qotho,"Bring her to me, with her chest."
4638,Daenerys,Qotho,The maegi.
4639,Daenerys,Qotho,"This I will not do.You will,or when Drogo wakes, he will hear why you defied me."
4640,Doreah,Drogo,"No,No, no."
4641,Drogo,Jhogo,"Admit no one without my leave,No one."
4642,Daenerys,Drogo,"He dies,"
4643,Daenerys,Drogo,The khal cannot die.
4644,Daenerys,Drogo,"He still wears the bells his father gave him.Khaleesi, he fell from his horse."
4645,Daenerys,Drogo,"We must bathe him,"
4646,Doreah,Drogo,"Irri, have the tub brought at once.Doreah, Eroeh, find water, cool water, hes so hot."
4647,Drogo,Irri,Where is Mirri Maz Duur?
4648,Drogo,Irri,"Ootho will find her,"
4649,Aggo,Jorah,"Khaleesi, the Andal is come, and begs leave to enter.The AndalYes,send him in."
4650,Daenerys,Drogo,"Talk goes from mouth to ear, all over the khalasar,It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse.Help him,For the love you say you bear me, help him now."
4651,Daenerys,Drogo,Send your maids away.
4652,Daenerys,Drogo,"No,No, please, gods hear me, no."
4653,Daenerys,Drogo,"Your khal is good as dead, Princess.No, he cant die, he mustnt, it was only a cut."
4654,Daenerys,Jorah,I will not let him die .
4655,Daenerys,Jorah,.
4656,Daenerys,Jorah,"Khaleesi or queen, that command is beyond your power."
4657,Daenerys,Jorah,"We must go, and quickly, before he dies."
4658,Daenerys,Jorah,"Go?Where should we go?Asshai, I would say."
4659,Drogo,Jorah,"Will they come with us?Khal Drogo commanded them to keep me safe,"
4660,Drogo,Jorah,.
4661,Drogo,Jorah,I dont understand.
4662,Drogo,Jorah,.
4663,Drogo,Jorah,"Princess, hear me."
4664,Daenerys,Viserys,.
4665,Daenerys,Viserys,But why?
4666,Daenerys,Viserys,"Why should they kill a little baby?He is Drogos son, and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the world."
4667,Daenerys,Viserys,Better to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows to manhood.
4668,Daenerys,Jorah,They must not hurt my son!
4669,Daenerys,Jorah,"I will order my khas to keep him safe, and Drogos bloodriders will-A bloodrider dies with his khaL You know that, child."
4670,Daenerys,Jorah,"when it is done, they will join Drogo in the night lands."
4671,Daenerys,Drogo,"I will not leave him,"
4672,Daenerys,Drogo,I will not.
4673,Drogo,Haggo,"The wound has festered.This is your work, maegi,"
4674,Daenerys,Qotho,Stop it!
4675,Daenerys,Drogo,
4676,Daenerys,Qotho,.
4677,Daenerys,Qotho,"No,I will not have her harmed."
4678,Daenerys,Qotho,No?
4679,Jorah,Qotho,"You did this, as much as the other."
4680,Daenerys,Qotho,"Rein in your tongue, bloodrider.The princess is still your khaleesi. Only while the blood-of-my-blood still lives,When he dies, she is nothing."
4681,Daenerys,Qotho,"Before I was khaleesi, I was the blood of the dragon.Ser Jorah, summon my khas.No,We will go."
4682,Haggo,Qotho,Khaleesi. 
4683,Daenerys,Haggo,"That one means you no good, Princess,The Dothraki say a man and his bloodriders share one life, and Qotho sees it ending.A dead man is beyond fear.No one has died,Ser Jorah, I may have need of your blade.Best go don your armor."
4684,Daenerys,Mirri,As you say.
4685,Daenerys,Mirri,"So you have saved me once more.And now you must save him,Please  Mirri replied sharply, "
4686,Daenerys,Drogo,"Ask or tell, it makes no matter.He is beyond a healers skills."
4687,Daenerys,Mirri,"He has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy.Yes,I made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and bound it in a lambskin.It burned, he said."
4688,Daenerys,Mirri,"The herbwomen made him a new one, wet and soothing.It burned, yes.There is great healing magic in fire, even your hairless men know that.Make him another poultice,This time I will make certain he wears it.The time for that is past, my lady,All I can do now is ease the dark road before him, so he   might ride painless to the night lands.He will be gone by morning."
4689,Daenerys,Mirri,"No,Save him, and I will free you, I swear it."
4690,Daenerys,Mirri,.
4691,Daenerys,Mirri,There is a spell.
4692,Daenerys,Mirri,"But it is hard, lady, and dark."
4693,Daenerys,Mirri,My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.
4694,Daenerys,Mirri,"Then you truly are a maegi Only a maegi can save your rider now, Silver Lady.Is there no other way?No other."
4695,Daenerys,Drogo,"Do it,"
4696,Daenerys,Drogo,"Save him.There is a price,Youll have gold, horses, whatever you like.It is not a matter of gold or horses."

4779,Bran,Luwin,"No.They dont fight very well,"
4780,Bran,Luwin,"For a certainty,"
4781,Luwin,Rodrik,Yet given time .
4782,Bran,Rodrik,"Many will not come back to us, and we must needs find the men to take their places."
4783,Bran,Tommen,"If I still had my legs, I could beat them all."
4784,Hodor,Tommen,Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe.
4785,Hodor,Luwin,We could be a knight together.I think that .
4786,Daenerys,Drogo, Maester Luwin said.
4787,Luwin,Rodrik,You fight like a goose.
4788,Bran,Rodrik,"If those were real swords, the first peck would take your arm off!"
4789,Bran,Rodrik,You laugh.
4790,Bran,Rodrik,".There was a knight once who couldnt see,Old Nan told me about him.He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once.Symeon Star-Eyes,When he lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim."
4791,Bran,Florian,A fable from the Age of Heroes.
4792,Bran,Florian,"You must put these dreams aside, they will only break your heart."
4793,Bran,Florian,I dreamed about the crow again last night.
4794,Bran,Luwin,He was sad.And why was that?
4795,Bran,Luwin,"It was something to do about Jon, I think."
4796,Bran,Luwin,Hodor wont go down into the crypts.
4797,Bran,Luwin,Hodor wont .
4798,Daenerys,Drogo,
4799,Bran,Hodor,"It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is always doing.I didnt, though.Good.Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I cant do that when Im awake,Why would you want to go down to the crypts?I told you.To look for Father."
4800,Bran,Hodor,"Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside his father and his fathers father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the North ."
4801,Hodor,Osha,"You will not find him in the crypts.He was there last night.I talked to him.Stubborn boy,Would you like to go see?I cant.Hodor wont go, and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer.I believe I can solve that difficulty."
4802,Bran,Osha,"I lived my life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground wont fret me none, mlords,Summer, come,"
4803,Bran,Osha,"Grim folk, by the look of them,They were the Kings of Winter,"
4804,Luwin,Osha,"Winters got no king.If youd seen it, youd know that, summer boy.They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,"
4805,Jon,Luwin,Hard men for a hard time.Come.
4806,Bran,Osha,"Do you recall your history, Bran?"
4807,Bran,Osha,"Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can."
4808,Nan,Rickard,That one is Jon Stark.
4809,Aegon,Bran,"He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said hed never faced a finer swordsman."
4810,Bran,Lyanna,"And theres my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys."
4811,Brandon,Osha,"Theyre not supposed to have statues, thats only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so much he had them done.The maids a fair one,Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her,Robert fought a war to win her back.He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, but Lyanna died and he never got her back at all.A sad tale,but those empty holes are sadder.Lord Eddards tomb, for when his time comes,Is this where you saw your father in your dream, Bran?Yes."
4812,Bran,Luwin,"As you see, hes not here."
4813,Bran,Luwin,"Dreams are only dreams, child."
4814,Bran,Luwin,Do you see?
4815,Bran,Luwin,Summer!
4816,Bran,Rickard,"Shaggy,"
4817,Luwin,Rickon,"You let my father be,You let him be.Rickon,Fathers not here.Yes he is.I saw him."
4818,Bran,Rickon,I saw him last night.In your dream ... ?
4819,Bran,Rickon,You leave him.
4820,Bran,Luwin,Hes coming home.
4821,Bran,Luwin,"Osha, the torch,"
4822,Bran,Rickon,That .
4823,Bran,Rickon," Luwin went on, "
4824,Bran,Rickon,I let him loose.He doesnt like chains.
4825,Bran,Rickon,"Rickon,would you like to come with me?No.I like it here.Its dark here.And cold.Im not afraid.I have to wait for Father.You can wait with me,Well wait together, you and me and our wolves."
4826,Bran,Rickon,"Bran,"
4827,Bran,Luwin,"The truth is hard, but the wolf has to be chained, or ."
4828,Daenerys,Drogo,He was not made for chains.
4829,Luwin,Osha,"The boys the lordling here, as I recall."
4830,Bran,Luwin,"The maesters tower it is.Will you come, Rickon?"
4831,Bran,Osha,"If Shaggy comes too,"
4832,Luwin,Osha,"This is folly,I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream, yet when you stop to consider it, its only natural."
4833,Osha,Rickon, 
4834,Luwin,Osha,"-too young, and-ooh, seven hells, that burns, no, dont stop, more.Too young, as I say, but you, Bran, youre old enough to know that dreams are only dreams.Some are, some arent."
4835,Luwin,Osha,The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming.
4836,Bran,Luwin,The children .
4837,Bran,Luwin,"Pads and then wrap, and make it tight, Ill be bleeding.Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals,She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it.And all this they did with magic,I wish they were here now.A spell would heal my arm less painfully, and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite."
4838,Bran,Luwin,"Take a lesson, Bran."
4839,Bran,Luwin,"Here, let me show you something."
4840,Bran,Rickon,"Have a look at these,"
4841,Bran,Rickon,Its made of glass.
4842,Osha,Rickon,"Dragonglass,Obsidian,Forged in the fires of the gods, far below the earth."
4843,Bran,Osha,"In place of swords, they carried blades of obsidian.And still do."
4844,Luwin,Rickon,"Can I keep one?As you wish,I want one too,I want four.Im four."
4845,Bran,Luwin,"Careful, theyre still sharp.Dont cut yourself.Tell me about the children,"
4846,Bran,Luwin,What do you wish to know?Everything.
4847,Bran,Luwin,"They were people of the Dawn Age, the very first, before kings and kingdoms,In those days, there were no castles or holdfasts, no cities, not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne."
4848,Bran,Luwin,"They were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even when grown to manhood."
4849,Eddison,Mag,"But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken."
4850,Eddison,Mag,There they forged the Pact.
4851,Bran,Osha,The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children.
4852,Bran,Osha,"The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes."
4853,Bran,Osha,"But the children of the forest are all gone now, you said.Here, they are,North of the Wall, things are different.Thats where the children went, and the giants, and the other old races."
4854,Bran,Luwin,"Woman, by rights you ought to be dead or in chains."
4855,Bran,Rickon,"It is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys heads with folly.Tell me where they went,I want to know.Me too,Oh, very well,So long as the kingdoms of the First Men held sway, the Pact endured, all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms, yet finally there came a time, many centuries later, when other peoples crossed the narrow sea.The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests."
4856,Daenerys,Drogo,
4857,Bran,Luwin,"Its coming, "
4858,Bran,Osha,"A hawk,perhaps an owl."
4859,Bran,Osha,What is it?
4860,Luwin,Osha,"You know what it is, boy,"
4861,Luwin,Osha,"My lords,"
4862,Luwin,Maegor,.
4863,Joffrey,Sansa,"Please, please, Ill be good, Ill be good, please dont,"
4864,Joffrey,Sandor,"You will attend me in court this afternoon,See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed."

4869,Joffrey,Sansa,I only want to go home.
4870,Joffrey,Sansa,"As it please you,It does not please me,Mother says Im still to marry you, so youll stay here, and youll obey.I dont want to marry you,You chopped off my fathers head!He was a traitor."
4871,Joffrey,Sansa,"If he hadnt been your father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave him a clean death."
4872,Joffrey,Sansa,"I hate you,"
4873,Joffrey,Sansa,My mother tells me that it isnt fitting that a king should strike his wife.Ser Meryn.
4874,Meryn,Sansa,"Will you obey now, or shall I have him chastise you again?"
4875,Joffrey,Sansa,I .
4876,Joffrey,Meryn,"as you command, my lord.Your Grace, I shall look for you in court."

4878,Sandor,Sansa,"Please, tell me.He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love,He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you."
4879,Sandor,Sansa,and fear him.
4880,Joffrey,Sansa,"I will need hot water for my bath, please,and perfume, and some powder to hide this bruise."
4881,Meryn,Sansa,"My lady,His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room.Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?Are you refusing to come, my lady?"
4882,Sandor,Sansa,"No,I shall do whatever His Grace commands.As I do,Yes ."
4883,Sandor,Sansa,"but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn."
4884,Ilyn,Joffrey,"To the death,"
4885,Joffrey,Sansa,"If you loved a traitor, you must be a traitor too,"
4886,Ilyn,Petyr,"Life is not a song, sweetling,You may learn that one day to your sorrow."
4887,Joffrey,Robert,"Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants."
4888,Meryn,Sansa,"You look much better than you did.Thank you, Your Grace,"
4889,Joffrey,Sansa,"Walk with me,"
4890,Joffrey,Sansa,"My name day will be here soon,There will be a great feast, and gifts.What are you going to give me?I ."
4891,Joffrey,Meryn,"I had not thought, my lord.Your Grace,You truly are a stupid girl, arent you?My mother says so.She does?"
4892,Meryn,Sandor,"Oh, yes.She worries about our children, whether theyll be stupid like you, but I told her not to trouble herself."
4893,Meryn,Sandor,"Thank you, Your Grace,"
4894,Joffrey,Sansa,"Ill get you with child as soon as youre able,If the first one is stupid, Ill chop off your head and find a smarter wife.When do you think youll be able to have children?"
4895,Joffrey,Sansa,Septa Mordane says most .
4896,Joffrey,Sansa,most highborn girls have their flowering at twelve or thirteen.
4897,Joffrey,Sansa,This way.

4902,Sandor,Sansa,"Do it, girl,"
4903,Joffrey,Sansa,What are you looking at?
4904,Joffrey,Sansa,"This is what I wanted you to see, right here."

4993,Daenerys,Mirri,"You warned me that only death could pay for life.I thought you meant the horse.No,That was a lie you told yourself.You knew the price."
4994,Daenerys,Mirri,"The price was paid,The horse, my child, Quaro and Qotho, Haggo and Cohollo.The price was paid and paid and paid."
4995,Daenerys,Drogo,Where is Khal Drogo?
4996,Daenerys,Drogo,"Show me what I bought with my sons life.As you command, Khaleesi,Come, I will take you to him."
4997,Daenerys,Jorah,"Time enough for this later, my princess,I would see him now, Ser Jorah."
4998,Jhogo,Jorah,"Drogos khalasar is gone,A khal who cannot ride is no khal,The Dothraki follow only the strong,I am sorry, my princess."
4999,Aggo,Rakharo,"There are a dozen new khalasars on the Dothraki sea, where once there was only Drogos.The old remain,The frightened, the weak, and the sick."
5000,Aggo,Rakharo,"We remain.They took Khal Drogos herds, Khaleesi,We were too few to stop them."
5001,Daenerys,Rakharo,"They took many slaves as well, the khals and yours, yet they left some few.Eroeh?"
5002,Aggo,Jhogo,"Mago seized her, who is Khal Jhaqos bloodrider now,He mounted her high and low and gave her to his khal, and Jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders."
5003,Aggo,Jhogo,"When they were done with her, they cut her throat.It was her fate, Khaleesi,"
5004,Aggo,Mag,"It was a cruel fate,"
5005,Aggo,Mag,"Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh."
5006,Daenerys,Mag,"Khaleesi, Jhaqo is a khal now, with twenty thousand riders at his back."
5007,Daenerys,Mag,"And I am Daenerys Stormhorn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old Valyria before them."
5008,Daenerys,Mag,Now bring me to Khal Drogo.
5009,Daenerys,Jorah,"Why is he out here alone, in the sun?"
5010,Daenerys,Jorah,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess,His eyes follow the sun, though he does not see it."
5011,Daenerys,Mirri,"He will eat if you put food in his mouth, drink if you dribble water on his lips."
5012,Daenerys,Mirri,"Your spells are costly, maegi.He lives,You asked for life.You paid for life.This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was."
5013,Daenerys,Mirri,"His life was his bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give him."
5014,Daenerys,Mirri,When will he be as he was?
5015,Daenerys,Mirri,"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
5016,Daenerys,Jorah,"Then he will return, and not before."
5017,Daenerys,Jorah,Leave us.I would speak with this maegi alone.
5018,Daenerys,Jorah,"You knew,"
5019,Daenerys,Jorah,"You* knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay it.It was wrong of them to burn my temple,That angered the Great Shepherd.This was no gods work,"
5020,Daenerys,Jorah,"You cheated me.You murdered my child within me.The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now.I spoke for you,I saved you.Saved me?"
5021,Daenerys,Jorah,"Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch."
5022,Daenerys,Mirri,Tell me again what you saved.Your life.
5023,Daenerys,Mirri,"Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is gone."
5024,Daenerys,Doreah,"Remember, Drogo,Remember our first ride together, the day we wed."
5025,Daenerys,Doreah,"Remember, and come back to me."
5026,Daenerys,Drogo,"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
5027,Daenerys,Drogo,"Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before."
5028,Daenerys,Drogo, Tywin Lannister said.The messengers voice was dulled by 
5029,Harys,Robb,How could this happen?
5030,Harys,Robb,How?
5031,Jaime,Tyrion,Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?
5032,Kevan,Tyrion,"I would have done the same,You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter."
5033,Jaime,Marq,"There is no other way, none.Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,Wed built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other."
5034,Gregor,Jaime,.And your outriders?
5035,Gregor,Marq,They saw nothing?They gave you no warning?
5036,Marq,Tywin,Our outriders had been vanishing.
5037,Marq,Tywin,"The ones who did come back had seen nothing.A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,Cut them out and give them to your next outrider."
5038,Gregor,Tywin,"and if not, the man after him will have six."
5039,Kevan,Tyrion,"You said they came at night,"
5040,Kevan,Tyrion,"The Blacklish led the van, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault."
5041,Eddison,Tyrion,and those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for them on the riverbanks.
5042,Eddison,Tyrion,"My lord father-Sorry, my lord,Lord Brax was clad in plateand-mail when his raft overturned.He was very gallant."
5043,Forley,Tyrion,"The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse."
5044,Forley,Kevan,"Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear.Gods save us,Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with them all."
5045,Forley,Kevan,"He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe.Curse the man."
5046,Kevan,Tywin,I warned Jaime not to trust that one.A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.
5047,Harys,Tyrion,How could it happen?
5048,Harys,Tyrion,"Ser Jaime taken, the siege broken ."
5049,Harys,Tyrion,"this is a catastrophe!I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys."
5050,Eddard,Tyrion,We must sue for peace.Peace?
5051,Eddard,Tyrion,"Theres your peace, Ser Harys."
5052,Addam,Robb,"or hadnt you noticed?Two battles do not make a war,We are far from lost.I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,And what are we to offer for my brother?Lord Eddards rotting head?I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hands daughters,If we give the lad his sisters back ."
5053,Addam,Tyrion,.
5054,Addam,Tyrion,"He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannisters life for two girls.Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,"
5055,Harys,Tyrion,"If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaimes armor.if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,We should march on them at once.Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host."
5056,Harys,Tywin,"They have my son, Leave me.All of you."
5057,Kevan,Tyrion,"Not you, Tyrion."
5058,Kevan,Tyrion,"The rest of you, out."
5059,Kevan,Tyrion,"Uncle,if you would be so kind-Here."
5060,Eddard,Tywin,You have the right of it about Stark.
5061,Robert,Tyrion,"Madness.Rank madness.Joffreys only a boy,At his age, I committed a few follies of my own."
5062,Tyrion,Tywin,I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore.
5063,Kevan,Tywin,"Our position is worse than you know,It would seem we have a new king."
5064,Kevan,Tywin,A new-who?What have they done to Joffrey?
5065,Kevan,Tywin,Nothing .
5066,Kevan,Margaery,The brides father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.Those are grave tidings.
5067,Kevan,Tyrion,"My daughter commands us to ride for Kings Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers."
5068,Tyrion,Tywin,"Commands us, mind you.In the name of the king and council.How is King Joffrey taking the news?"
5069,Tyrion,Tywin,"Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself.With what army?"
5070,Tyrion,Tywin,"You dont plan to give him this one, I hope?He talks of leading the City Watch,If he takes the Watch, hell leave the city undefended,And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone ."
5071,Kevan,Tywin,.Yes.
5072,Kevan,Tywin,"I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.Why, Father,that almost sounds like praise."
5073,Renly,Tywin,What of Stannis?
5074,Renly,Varys,How does he feel about his brothers claim?
5075,Renly,Varys,I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined.
5076,Kevan,Stannis,Is any of it true?
5077,Kevan,Tywin,"Kevan, bring us the map."
5078,Roose,Tywin,Jaime has left us in a bad way.
5079,Beric,Tyrion,"To our east we have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storms End are calling their banners."
5080,Tyrion,Tywin,"Take heart, Father.At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,"
5081,Kevan,Roose,Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now.
5082,Renly,Roose,"Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.I have no intention of remaining here."
5083,Harren,Tywin,"I will have no vanishings.As you say, my lord, but ."
5084,Harren,Tywin,"Some call it cursed.Let them,Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers."
5085,Amory,Kevan,"Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.They will burn, my lord,I shall give the commands."
5086,Tyrion,Tywin,"Your savages might relish a bit of rapine.Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like-goods, stock, women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,but I should prefer to keep them with me."
5087,Tyrion,Tywin,Then you had best learn to control them.I will not have the city plundered.The city?
5088,Tyrion,Tywin,What city would that be?Kings Landing.I am sending you to court.
5089,Petyr,Tyrion,"And what am I to do there?Rule,My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!Let her say what she likes."
5090,Barristan,Harren,A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.
5091,Barristan,Tyrion,"And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that?"
5092,Barristan,Tyrion,"You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench."
5093,Barristan,Tyrion,"If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must."
5094,Barristan,Tyrion,.
5095,Barristan,Tyrion,"Spikes,Heads.Walls.I see you have taken a few lessons from me.More than you know, Father,"
5096,Addam,Tywin,Why me?
5097,Addam,Tywin,Why not my uncle?
5098,Addam,Tywin,bigger man?
5099,Addam,Tywin,You are my son.
5100,Tyrion,Tywin,"One last thing,You will not take the whore to court."
5101,Shae,Tyrion,"Mlord,"
5102,Jon,Tyrion,"I have a mind to take you to Kings Landing, sweetling,"
5103,Jon,Tyrion,"Easy, sweet lady,"
5104,Jon,Samwell,"Ghost,to me."
5105,Jon,Samwell,"Jon, please.You must not do this."
5106,Jon,Samwell,"Get out of my way, SamwellJon, you cant,I wont let you.I would sooner not hurt you,Move aside, Samwell or Ill ride you down.You wont."
5107,Jon,Samwell,"I warned him,It was nothing to do with him, anyway."
5108,Desmond,Eddard,"You said the words,You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new."
5109,Eddison,Jon,buried treasures.
5110,Eddison,Jon,Ghost!
5111,Eddison,Jon,"Ghost, to me."
5112,Eddison,Jon,"Ghost, Where are you?"
5113,Eddison,Jon,Ghost!
5114,Eddison,Jon,"Ouiet now,"
5115,Grenn,Jon,.
5116,Daenerys,Drogo,.
5117,Grenn,Jon,Thats what Id do.In the dark?
5118,Grenn,Jon,I would not.
5119,Grenn,Jon,"Id just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.What if the sky was cloudy?"
5120,Grenn,Jon,Then I wouldnt go.
5121,Grenn,Jon,"You know where Id be if it was me?Id be in Moles Town, digging for buried treasure."
5122,Grenn,Jon,"Keep quiet, all of you,I thought I heard something.Where?I didnt hear anything."
5123,Grenn,Jon,"You cant hear yourself fart.I can too,Quiet!"
5124,Halder,Jon,"What did you hear?I dont know,A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but ."
5125,Halder,Jon,.Theres nothing here.
5126,Halder,Jon,There!
5127,Halder,Jon,"I heard it too!Traitor,"
5128,Grenn,Jon,Jon!
5129,Grenn,Jon,"Pull up,You cant outrun us all."
5130,Halder,Jon,"Get back.I dont wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to.One against seven?"
5131,Grenn,Jon,What do you want with me?
5132,Grenn,Jon,"We want to take you back where you belong,I belong with my brother.Were your brothers now,Theyll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,This is so stupid, its like something the Aurochs would do.I would not,Im no oathbreaker.I said the words and I meant them.So did U Jon told them.Dont you understand?"
5133,Jon,Robb,"    said Pyp solemnly. Grenn said, Once you say the words, you cant leave, no matter what.I have to,You said the words,Now my watch begins, you said it.It shall not end until my death. I shall live and die at my post, You dont have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do."
5134,Halder,Jon,"I am the sword in the darkness, The watcher on the walls, "
5135,Halder,Jon,"I am the fire that bums against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the hom that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. Stay back,I mean it, Pyp."
5136,Halder,Jon,Ipledge my life and honor to the Nights Watch. 
5137,Halder,Jon,For this night Halder trotted in from the left.
5138,Daenerys,Drogo,
5139,Halder,Jon,"So here are your choices.Kill me, or come back with me."
5140,Halder,Jon,"Damn you,Damn you all.Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word youll ride back peaceful?"
5141,Halder,Jon,"I wont run, if thats what you mean."
5142,Halder,Jon,"Small help you were,"
5143,Halder,Jon,"We had best hurry,If were not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads."
5144,Jon,Samwell,I .
5145,Jon,Samwell,"Im glad they found you, Jon."
5146,Hobb,Jon,"Give us a hand bedding down the horses, SamwellWe have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow."
5147,Hobb,Jon,"Corn, corn, corn. "
5148,Hobb,Jon,"Put the food on the table,Ill have some beer."
5149,Hobb,Jon,"Doubtless you loved your father,The things we love destroy us every time, lad.Remember when I told you that?I remember,"
5150,Aemon,Jon,See that you never forget it.
5151,Aemon,Jon,Was your moonlight ride so tiring?
5152,Aemon,Jon,"You know?Know, Know."
5153,Aemon,Jon,"Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Nights Watch because Im dumb as a stump, Snow?"
5154,Aemon,Jon,"and honor brought you back.My friends brought me back,Did I say it was your honor?"
5155,Aemon,Jon,"They killed my father.Did you expect me to do nothing?If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did."
5156,Aemon,Jon,"I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving."
5157,Aemon,Jon,Do you?No.
5158,Aemon,Jon,"Pity, we could use a horse like that."
5159,Eddison,Jon,"I know the penalty for desertion, my lord.Im not afraid to die.Die!"
5160,Eddison,Jon,"Nor live, I hope,You have not deserted-yet."
5161,Eddison,Jon,"Is that your hope, boy?"
5162,Eddison,Jon,I thought so.
5163,Eddison,Jon,"Your father is dead, lad.Do you think you can bring him back?No,Good,Weve seen the dead come back, you and me, and its not something I care to see again."
5164,Jon,Maege,Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him.
5165,Jon,Maege,"Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?"
5166,Jon,Maege,You are not the only one touched by this war.
5167,Jon,Maege,"Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters."
5168,Jon,Maege,Or perhaps it does.
5169,Cotter,Jon,"where is yours, boy?"
5170,Cotter,Jon,"I dont know.I do,The cold winds are rising, Snow."
5171,Jon,Mance,"Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger weve lost this past year?Ben Jen, Ben Jen.Ben Jen. No,"
5172,Jon,Mance,Do you think your brothers war is more important than ours?
5173,Jon,Mance,"War, war, war, war, Its not,Gods save us, boy, youre not blind and youre not stupid.When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?No."
5174,Jon,Mance,"Your lord father sent you to us, Jon.Why, who can say?"
5175,Jon,Mance,Why?
5176,Jon,Mance,All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks.
5177,Eddison,Jon,"Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and Im not."
5178,Eddison,Jon,"I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall."
5179,Eddison,Jon,"Beyond the Wall?You heard me.I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead."
5180,Jon,Robb,I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds.
5181,Jon,Robb,I mean to command them myself.
5182,Jon,Robb,"By custom, the Lord Commanders steward is his squire as well ."
5183,Jon,Robb,or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
5184,Arya,Bran,I am .
5185,Arya,Bran,I will not run again.
5186,Arya,Bran,Good.Now go put on your sword.
5187,Catelyn,Robb,Winterfell!
5188,Edmure,Theon,"Bring them in,"
5189,Catelyn,Edmure,"Sweet sister,"
5190,Catelyn,Eddard,"Your grief is mine, Cat,When we heard about Lord Eddard ."
5191,Catelyn,Eddard,"the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.Will that bring Eddard back to me?"
5192,Eddard,Edmure,"All that will keep.I must see Father.He awaits you in his solar,Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,"
5193,Edmure,Petyr,He instructed me to bring you to him at once.Ill take her.
5194,Brandon,Edmure,How bad is he?
5195,Edmure,Lysa,"He will not be with us long, the maesters say."
5196,Edmure,Lysa,"constant, and grievous."
5197,Eddard,Lysa,"You should have told me,You should have sent word as soon as you knew.He forbade it."
5198,Catelyn,Hoster,.
5199,Catelyn,Hoster,they might attack?
5200,Edmure,Hoster,"He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,Father, see who Ive brought."
5201,Catelyn,Edmure,"Little cat,My little cat."
5202,Catelyn,Edmure,I watched for you .
5203,Catelyn,Edmure,".I shall leave you to talk,"
5204,Catelyn,Vyman,"You should have told me,A rider, a raven ."
5205,Catelyn,Vyman,".Riders are taken, questioned,Ravens are brought down ."
5206,Catelyn,Vyman,.
5207,Catelyn,Vyman,The crabs are in my belly .
5208,Hoster,Jaime,".Im here, Father,With Robb, my son.Hell want to see you too.Your boy,He had my eyes, I remember "
5209,Hoster,Jaime,"Riverrun is free again, Father."
5210,Hoster,Jaime,I saw.
5211,Brynden,Catelyn,"Was it your Robb?Yes,It was Robb ."
5212,Brynden,Catelyn,"Your brother is here as well, my lord.Him."
5213,Brynden,Catelyn,The Brynden .
5214,Brynden,Catelyn,"From the Vale?Yes.,,   "
5215,Brynden,Catelyn,"Gods be good, your sister ."
5216,Brynden,Hoster,did she come as well?
5217,Brynden,Hoster,No.
5218,Brynden,Hoster,.Oh.
5219,Brynden,Hoster,"Id hoped I would have liked to see her, before "
5220,Catelyn,Hoster,"Lord Robert now, poor Arryns gone ."
5221,Catelyn,Hoster,"why did she not come with you?She is frightened, my lord.In the Eyrie she feels safe."
5222,Catelyn,Hoster,Robb will be waiting.
5223,Catelyn,Hoster,"And Brynden?Your son,Yes."
5224,Catelyn,Hoster,yes.And your brother?
5225,Beth,Catelyn,"Brynden,Has he wed yet?"
5226,Beth,Catelyn,girl to wife?
5227,Beth,Catelyn,"He has not wed. You know that, Father.Nor will he ever.I told him ."
5228,Beth,Catelyn,".Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,She has three children by him.Even so,Even so."
5229,Brynden,Walder,"Anyone?No one,yet he has come many leagues to see you, fighting his way back to Riverrun. her father husked."
5230,Brynden,Catelyn,Send him.
5231,Brynden,Catelyn,.
5232,Brynden,Catelyn,Is he-T  she said.
5233,Brynden,Catelyn,Will he see me?
5234,Brynden,Catelyn,He says he is too sick to fight.
5235,Brynden,Catelyn,"I am too old a soldier to believe that.Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, damn his bones."
5236,Catelyn,Theon,"I do not see Robb.He went with Greyjoy to the hall, I believe."
5237,Robb,Theon,"Some tried to flee, but wed pinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance."
5238,Eddard,Robb,"  she interrupted, "
5239,Catelyn,Petyr,"He tried to put his tongue in my mouth,He did with me too,I liked it."
5240,Hoster,Robb,"Mother,We must call a council.There are things to be decided.Your grandfather would like to see you,Robb, hes very sick.Ser Edmure told me."
5241,Galbart,Hoster,Renly Baratheon has claimed his brothers crown.Renly?
5242,Galbart,Hoster,"I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis ."
5243,Galbart,Hoster,".So did we all, my lady,"
5244,Renly,Robb,"Renly is not the king,"
5245,Galbart,Robb,"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,He put your father to death.That makes him evil,I do not know that it makes Renly king."
5246,Marq,Robb,"Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.Tommen is no less a Lannister,As you say,Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly?"
5247,Marq,Robert,"Bran cant be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly cant be king before Lord Stannis."
5248,Marq,Robert,"Lord Stannis has the better claim.Renly is crowned,Highgarden and Storms End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly."
5249,Renly,Robb,"What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?The right,"
5250,Edmure,Robb,So you mean us to declare for Stannis?
5251,Edmure,Robb,"I dont know,I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer.The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.My lord father would urge caution,Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones."
5252,Greatjon,Harren,.
5253,Greatjon,Rickard,Craven!
5254,Greatjon,Rickard,"Begging for a truce will make us seem weak,Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer,Why not a peace?"
5255,Catelyn,Robb,"My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband,"
